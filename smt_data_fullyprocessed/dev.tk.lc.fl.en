remarks by speaker
speaker ( mr. barnabas ) :
honourable members , mr. prime minister , madame commissioner , madame minister , distinguished guests , ladies and gentlemen . welcome .
please allow me to begin by expressing my deep appreciation for the trust and confidence that you have placed in me by selecting me as your speaker .
as speaker , it is my responsibility to serve this assembly in the spirit of impartiality and fairness .
i pledge to you that i am mindful of my duty to ensure that the rights of the house and its members are upheld . our work starts today .
as we perform our duties in this house , its committees and in our constituencies , we know that the eyes of those who elected us to our positions of trust are upon us .
as the youngest of canada &apos;s legislatures , much is expected of us .
this legislature is only one of two in all of canada that does not operate on a partisan basis .
rather , the spirit of consensus guides us . the best decisions are those that are achieved through dialogue .
civility and respect are among the qualities that shall characterize this place . consensus can build accountability .
together , we will find the path - a path that is lit brightly by the fact that the composition of this assembly reflects the diversity of nunavut itself .
some of us come from the assembly of our new western neighbour , and we are grateful for the support of our former colleagues and constant friends .
we thank the students of inuksuk high school for once again sharing their place of learning .
we look to the energy of our youth and the wisdom of our elders to inspire us in the years ahead .
i would like to take a moment to recognize the elders and youth that are with us today .
elders from all of nunavut &apos;s communities are represented at this gathering - we thank them for their years of effort in achieving this day .
the pages that you see come from the 19 constituencies of nunavut . many of them are travelling away from home for the first time .
we are also honoured to have with us in the room today the honourable premier of the northwest territories , mr. jim antoine , and former premier nellie cournoyea .
i believe that you will all agree that the artwork which surrounds us is beautiful .
the wall hangings that you see were made by the quqshuun ilihakvik centre in gjoa haven ; the tusanik school in repulse bay and the inuujaq school in arctic bay .
on behalf of the legislative assembly and the government of nunavut , i would like to express our deep appreciation for the beautiful painting that you see in front of the stage .
it was presented last evening by the honourable jonathan motzfeldt , premier of greenland , to the honourable paul okalik .
these symbols , like the qamutik that rests on the floor , will find a home in our new assembly building .
i would finally like to recognize the artists who created the mace .
we are honoured that they are with us today .
inuk charlie , joseph suqslaq , paul malliki , mariano aupilardjuk , mathew nuqingaq and sam pitsiulak - thank you .
the mace , which will shortly be presented to the house , is itself a reflection of the rights and authority of a democratically elected assembly .
it is a gift from the qikiqtaaluk corporation and seven other inuit organizations .
it speaks eloquently for itself in the way it embodies the soul of our land , this assembly and our people .
thank you .
item 4 :
presentation of mace
speaker :
would the pages kipanik eejeesiak and teevi mackay , please summon the bearer of the mace .
&gt; &gt; the mace is brought in and laid upon the table .
speaker :
we can begin now .
please all rise and the page qujjuk amagoalik will be escorting the commissioner .
speaker :
madame commissioner , the members of the first legislative assembly of nunavut have elected me to be their speaker .
commissioner maksagak :
i assure you that the assembly shall have ready access to me and that the assembly &apos;s proceedings , words and actions shall receive from me favourable consideration .
&gt; &gt; the commissioner takes the chair .
item 5 :
commissioner &apos;s address
commissioner maksagak :
this is a great honour for me to give the first commissioner &apos;s address on behalf of our new government .
i would like to congratulate you mr. speaker , the premier-elect , the cabinet and all of the members of this assembly on being called to form the first government of nunavut .
the people of nunavut have put their trust in this assembly to work together in the creation of a new government in a new territory .
they have elected you because they believe and trust in your will and ability to carry this work forward .
our elders here today and listening to this speech on radio and on television can tell us how far we have come .
they remember the times , from their own lives and from the histories of their parents , when inuit were alone in this land .
as inuit we built our lives from what was around us .
from snow and bone , from the animals of the land and the sea , our elders fed and cared for their families .
they accomplished everything with little .
they travelled thousands of miles , at home in their environment , and taught the next generations the strength and ingenuity to carry inuit into the modern world .
the modern world is now here .
as inuit we share nunavut with others who have come to join us .
english and french speaking canadians , people from many lands , have become part of inuit communities .
new tools have been introduced to our land and inuit have taken those tools and made them our own .
snow and bone have turned to metal and paper .
together with our new neighbours we have established towns , built schools and airports , negotiated a land claim , and now we see the creation of a new territory .
nunavut is ours , but ours to share .
there is work to be done everywhere .
our government plans to develop a budget over the coming months and will introduce it this spring to this assembly .
our government will work to deliver services and programs to the people of nunavut in a sensitive , responsive and responsible manner .
our government also asks for your patience and your goodwill .
not everything will work the first time , not every office will be staffed ;
there will be some delays and false starts .
this is our government , we built it , we own it , we now have the responsibility to make it work .
tell us when things go astray and we will work with you to make them right .
our government will develop a legislative agenda for presentation to this assembly .
this will begin our journey towards creating nunavut solutions , laws , policies and programs .
in continuing this journey we commit to listening to the people of nunavut and continuing to be guided by the people &apos;s needs .
mr. speaker , this is a day of ceremony and celebration .
it is appropriate that our government is introducing today the flag act , which will designate the official flag of nunavut .
i am confident that the people of nunavut will be proud to see this symbol of our new territory flying in all our communities .
thanks are due to more people in more ways than words can express .
to the peoples of canada and their governments , in each province and territory , who have supported nunavut over the years :
we thank you with all our hearts , and we are proud to join you .
to the peoples of the northwest territories as we leave them , for having travelled so far with us , and for having been companions on our journey :
we thank you and wish you safe journey as our paths part .
to our elders who first dreamed , to our leaders and negotiators who first spoke the dream , to our children who have taken the dream into their hearts and lives :
we owe you everything and we will work to earn the trust we have been given .
today we join hands with you in the birth of nunavut .
speaker :
thank you madame commissioner .
now i would like to invite the hon. jane stewart , minister of indian affairs and northern development to address this assembly .
ms. stewart .
item 6 :
presentation by the hon. jane stewart , mp , minister of indian affairs and northern development
hon. jane stewart ( min . indian affairs and northern development ) :
mr. speaker , it is indeed an honour to be present at the first sitting of the new territory of nunavut .
respected elders , commissioner and prime minister , i join your voices in congratulating the premier-elect , the members of cabinet and the members of the legislature on their achievement to date .
mr. speaker i congratulate you as well on your selection and i listened to your advice to your colleagues in your introduction .
i don &apos;t expect that you will have the beautiful voices of the youth here to guide you but certainly it will be the youth and their future that will guide your decisions .
for years the people of the eastern arctic have dreamed of a territory they could call their own .
and while it has not been easy , individuals , organizations and government have long worked side by side with vision and determination to make the dream a reality .
today we are celebrating the fruits of our labours , nunavut .
this realization was carried out by the residents of nunavut for the people of nunavut .
recall the northwest territories of 1870 , a vast expanse of land by any measure , east to west , north to south .
already home to aboriginal people , it was soon the land of opportunity for newcomers .
a territory diverse in both population and geography .
responding to this diversity , canada has redrawn its map over time .
today out of the still vast northwest territories , canadians have created yet another territory that reflects our democratic vision .
that territory is nunavut , our land .
this evolution goes to the heart of what makes the canadian federation strong ; government &apos;s ability to grow in lockstep with the aspirations of her people .
as other nations around the world struggle to define themselves , often with great human cost , we count ourselves very lucky .
ours is not a history of war and conflict , it is one which is inspired by co-operation , by balance .
we have built a strong country in which we are masters of our own destinies .
with nunavut , canadians have once again taken the opportunity to make choices about their future .
those elders gathered here today have never doubted that it was the right choice .
and through their decades of hard work towards this moment they never doubted that if you can dream it , you can do it .
as nunavut takes its place in the canadian federation it will be tested .
you know , as do i , that expectations are very , very high .
you must create jobs , improve health , keep youth in school .
the government of nunavut , you , will be called upon to do all this and much , much more .
but i believe this is a territory and a people that are ready and up to the challenge .
of course we can &apos;t predict exactly what the future will bring , but i am convinced it holds tremendous promise for the people of nunavut and canada as a whole .
in fact , across the north , in nunavut , the northwest territories and the yukon there is exciting economic , social and political change underway .
change that brings northerners the tools and control they need to build strong , self-sufficient economies and communities , and an even brighter future .
just as the path of progress led us west in the twentieth century , so the path of opportunity leads us north in the twenty-first .
the government of canada is proud to have been a partner in this important undertaking .
the creation of nunavut .
thank you to all those whose commitment has brought about the birth of nunavut .
congratulations to you the political leaders and to the people of nunavut .
thank you and best wishes .
speaker :
on behalf of the assembly i would like to thank you for your remarks .
the chair will now entertain nominations to adopt the premier and executive council .
mr. hunter tootoo , honourable member for iqaluit centre .

-- applause
item 8 :
premier &apos;s address
mr. okalik :
respected elders , mr. speaker , those who have visited , mr. prime minister , minister stewart , madame commissioner , please feel welcome in nunavut .
as all of the nunavut residents , i am very proud of this moment and in having been selected as the first premier for nunavut .
i wish to thank the members of the legislative assembly for their support and encouragement in my selection as premier .
in the past two weeks , i have enjoyed working with the cabinet and the regular members .
we have already dealt with a number of issues and i look forward to working with you for a productive five years in our future .
as you all know , we had a long , hard journey towards nunavut .
there was a lot of hard work but we have reached the end of the journey and it feels like we have completed a lot of work .
the inuit of nunavut have settled the largest land claim in canadian history .
when we look at the canadian map we have reshaped that map today .
those are very symbolic gestures and they are a very big part of being a new territory of nunavut .
we would like to create a government that is founded on integrity and openness , that is one we can be proud of .
on this journey , in trying to get nunavut , there were troubles , many have fallen .
there were a lot of very special people who could not be here to celebrate with us today .
some of us have lost family members to suicide and some have lost relatives to the land as they were out harvesting the resources , trying to live the life of our forefathers .
some of us have known those who fell victim to abuse and aggression .
but it has always given me strength because we have to look to the future while respecting and remembering those who we lost , who are here today and watching us .
in respect of those dear people i would like to ask for a minute of silence to remember those who did not reach this day .
i would ask for a moment of silence .
&gt; &gt; moment of silence observed
thank you .
today the eyes of the world are upon us and as well the eyes of nunavut are upon us and watching .
our ancestors are also watching us .
they look to us , the people of nunavut .
in their eyes there is hope and expectation that we will succeed , and as the premier i will have a lot of responsibilities and i know i will have to work very hard .
i do not take that lightly , i accept that responsibility and i will continue to place first and foremost the people of nunavut because that is part of my job .
we are going to have a government that has many responsibilities and that cannot be taken lightly .
the people from kugluktuk to broughton island , from sanikiluaq to grise fiord will have to help us .
all of the nunavut residents will have to work hard , for our future has to be well planned in order for us to succeed .
i have gone to every corner of nunavut and i know that in the future , i am confident we will accomplish a better future .
to date i have seen a lot of strength and character in my fellow inuit and those who are willing , committed and determined to work .
we have to demonstrate that we can deal with the problems our society faces , because we are the only ones that can fix them .
our children especially , because they are watching , we have to prove ourselves to them and stand out as better role models .
i pledge to you , the people of nunavut , that the government of nunavut will work to ensure that there are the right conditions to assist you in making change .
we will make it possible for you to rise up and get an education .
we will make it possible for your families to move forward .
we will make it possible for our communities to grow in a healthy way .
we will put conditions in place for you to make nunavut strong again .
to the people of nunavut , nakurmiik , qujannamiik , matna , koana , thank you and merci .
in closing , i would like to echo comments by my colleague ovide alakannuark , &quot; we are no longer dreaming .
this is reality .
we have arrived . &quot;
--applause
speaker :
i would like to thank the members of the legislative assembly of nunavut and thank the premier for his words .
i would like to ask the prime minister , mr. jean chretien to address the assembly .
item 9 :
address by the right honourable jean chretien , p.c. , mp , prime minister of canada --applause
right hon. jean chretien ( prime minister of canada ) :
mr. speaker on behalf of the people of canada i am honoured by your invitation to address the first ever meeting of the legislative assembly of nunavut .
i would like to offer my congratulations for your election .
i want to congratulate the premier for having won the confidence of his colleagues here during the recent election .
i would like to tell him that it took me thirty years to become prime minister and you became premier in two weeks .
--laughter / applause
i would like to tell you that it is a great privilege to serve as leader .
it is both a serious responsibility and an incredible opportunity to shape the direction of a government and build the future of a people .
each and every member of this honourable assembly deserves equal praise and recognition .
you will go down in history as the first government of nunavut .
in you the people of nunavut have invested their faith and trust .
an investment that is never made lightly , but never more so than when a people take their first steps into a whole new future .
i never lost sight of that basic truth about elected office through thirty six years of public life .
governing is very different from the business of getting elected .
i learned that lesson soon after i arrived on parliament hill .
the trail of a victory is quickly replaced by the awesome amount of work that must be done .
as nunavut takes flight you are dealing with immense challenges .
work that will require patience , creativity and tremendous energy to resolve .
fortunately , the people of nunavut are blessed with these qualities in abundance .
your new premier and cabinet are fine cases in point .
you have the added advantage of being able to draw the best from both worlds .
traditional inuit teachings and values that have passed down through the ages and a modern government structure with access to state of the art technologies .
unlike in years past , the north of today is no longer hostage to geography and climate .
it is very much a part of the wired world , with equal access to the opportunities for growth and development that it presents .
i have no doubt that you will find the solutions that you seek .
that you will build on these strengths , focus your agenda on what can be achieved and set your sights on what matters the most to your people .
i want to assure you of the government of canada &apos;s commitment to being an active partner in your work and ensuring a new passage to the new millennium .
i also want to remind you that your contributions to canadian society will extend beyond the boundaries of the new territory .
your insights and ideas will be welcome as we address national priorities .
your unique northern perspectives and your consensus approach will be valuable as governments throughout canada work together for the common good .
nunavut is an acknowledgement that there is strength in diversity .
that government works best when it is closest to the people , that we will only move forward as a nation when we all move forward together .
indeed , among my proudest achievements as minister of indian affairs and northern development was helping create the first fully elected legislature in the northwest territories , a milestone on the road to nunavut .
it was great days in some ways when i was naming the members , until i named one and he decided to vote against my instructions .
so i decided it was better to have everybody elected .
i have high hopes and expectations of the men and women in this auditorium .
i look forward to watching your nunavut dream become a reality in the days and years ahead and i will look for your inukshuk as you lead the way .
good luck , congratulations and a happy nunavut day .
long live canada , long live nunavut .
--applause
speaker :
on behalf of the assembly , i would like to thank the prime minister of canada for being with us on this most historic day and for his gracious remarks .

thank you , prime minister .

appreciation and acknowledgement of educators
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
mr. speaker , it gives me great pleasure to stand in our legislative assembly to pay tribute to all educators across nunavut .
i would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the efforts and considerable energies which educators across nunavut have brought to our early childhood programs and to our schools .
we are fortunate to have dedicated and committed school staff who are working hard to lay a firm foundation for our children &apos;s education .
their commitment to developing the critical skills , processes and practices which will allow our children to lead successful and productive lives , is the backbone of our school system .
their appreciation of our children &apos;s language , heritage and cultural identity is what makes our classrooms and schools welcoming and affirming places to learn and grow .
it is a great pleasure to thank them for their hard work , and also to encourage them to continue on with us as we build our new educational system in nunavut .
we are fortunate to have exceptional educators who work as language specialists , teachers , student support assistants , cultural instructors and school community counsellors .
there are elders and community resource people who share their skill and wisdom .
there are parent volunteers who support their children &apos;s learning and promote the school activities in the community .
there are dedicated members of dea &apos;s who work diligently to ensure that the schools are meeting community goals and that teachers are supported in meeting those goals .
i also want to acknowledge the role of educators which each of us has to play .
our children &apos;s learning is the sum of all their experiences .
as parents , aunts , uncles , relatives , and so on , we all influence and have opportunities to enrich the learning and experiences of children in nunavut .
i challenge you to take this responsibility seriously and to actively join us in making nunavut a network of community teachers and learners .
through this kind of collaboration , we ensure that our children can be the best they can be , and we are all enriched by that .
the nunavut teachers federation is holding their founding meeting this weekend .
i would like to take this opportunity to wish them all the best .
please help me acknowledge and show appreciation to our educators of nunavut for all the hard work , commitment and groundwork they have done for education .
let us stand an applaud them .
thank you mr. speaker .

also i want to thank all the people here as well around the table and the executive council .
i appreciate them for putting me where i &apos;m sitting today .
first of all i want to make a comment .
in kugluktuk few weeks ago there was a new anglican minister .
we haven &apos;t had an inuk anglican minister in kugluktuk for a very long time , for sixty years , today we finally have an innuinnaqtun anglican minister , his name is sam kikpak .
he became an anglican minister in kugluktuk and sam kikpaq has been working there for a very long time and has been a lay reader for about 27 years .
also you know that since april 1 , we opened our first session legislative assembly .

ministers &apos; statements 8 - 1 ( 2 ) :
congratulations to labrador inuit on land claim
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
today i would also like to have the opportunity to congratulate the inuit of labrador on successfully reaching their land claims agreement .
i know that this has been a long and hard struggle with very few resources .
i recall back in the 1970 &apos;s when the late bill edmund struggled to get newfoundland to recognize the need to deal with the issue of aboriginal rights protection .
if bill were still alive today he would be mighty proud of them .
we are all proud of their perseverance , believing in their own people and keeping their issues in historical perspective allowed them success on this historical day .
there &apos;s much work ahead which will be just as difficult , but the light at the end of the tunnel will give them energy and anticipation for a challenging and fulfilling trip .
i &apos;m sure the people of nunavut will support them and assist them any way possible to reach their final destiny .
once again , on behalf of nunavut , congratulations .
thank you mr. speaker .

question 6 - 1 ( 2 ) :
inuktitut documentation
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker and to the ministers and all the members to the legislative assembly .
i have a question to pose to all of you , some of us members .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
thank you now i know better , i will direct this question to the government leader of nunavut .
for those of us who are inuktitut unilingual speaking members and cannot read and write english .
i would like to ask the leader when the government will be giving out documents in english , all the documents should be translated into inuktitut so that we can have a good input .
i understand that is self-explanatory .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
although this is an oral question i would like mr. havioyak to respond .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
those documents that have not been translated , some of them are being worked on and we personally are working on them at this time .
i will make sure that these documents are translated before they are given to the members that speak only inuktitut .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
oral questions .
mr. irqittuq .
question 7 - 1 ( 2 ) :
high costs of transportation
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
the cost of living is very expensive today because we have to transport the goods by airfreight .
if i were to order one snowmobile from montreal to hall beach the freight would cost over $ 2000.00 .
or if you send goods by the post office it is very expensive too , because it &apos;s almost twice as much to send something through the post office .
mr. speaker i would like to ask our premier if he will be looking into this issue .
thank you .
speaker :
( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
premier if you would like to respond it is totally up to your discretion .
i think this question could be posed to a few ministers , either to the minister responsible for transportation , or mr. ng .
would you like to respond .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker , mr. speaker , we know that our government does have several subsidies that we provide to our constituents .
thank you .

no .
oral questions ?
mr. puqiqnak .
question 8 - 1 ( 2 ) :
letter to minister on challenged constituent
mr. puqiqnak :
( interpretation ) thank you mr. speaker .
i would like to direct this question to the minister of education .
i wrote a letter to you mr. minister , i am sure you have received the letter i have sent you , dated april 3 .
there was a person who died in my community on that date who had adopted .
that person is an adult now , twenty four years old , deaf and mute .
since he is deaf and mute i think he really missed his adoptive parents , especially his father .
he was acting differently after the father died .
we spoke to the step-mother and we spoke to that person who is adopted as to how he or she wants to be educated .
that person wants to go to school and he or she felt he or she would feel much better after leaving the community .
i would like to ask the minister , what his position is in regards to the letter i sent him .
thank you mr. speaker .
minister arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
( interpretation ) thank you mr. speaker .
yes i have received the letter .
once i find out i will reply to his question as soon as possible .
thank you .
speaker :
( interpretation ) thank you mr. arvaluk .
we are still on oral questions , mr. o &apos;brien .

discontinuing payroll tax
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker my question is directed to the minister responsible for finance and f.m.b.s.
thank you .
hon. kelvin ng .
thank you mr. speaker , i cannot answer that question at this time .
the issue of the taxation within nunavut will be addressed in the budget speech tomorrow .
thank you .
speaker :
you should ask that question probably after the address of the minister of finance on the budget . ( interpretation ) thank you .
we are still on oral questions .
item six .
mr. alakannuark .
question 10 - 1 ( 2 ) :
traditional curriculum
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i would like to address this question to the minister of education .
yes i really appreciate the fact that our children have a chance to go to school in academics .
i was wondering what you are going to be doing about traditional education because there are many students up there who require traditional instruction .
thank you .
speaker :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
( interpretation ) mr. speaker , his question , i can answer his question and it would probably take all day to answer his question .
the response would be quite lengthy , perhaps if my friend can tell me what he is talking about in detail .
are you talking about inuktitut curriculum , traditional on the land , or inuktitut language instruction .
perhaps if you could be more specific .
speaker :
( interpretation ) mr. arvaluk , thank you .
could you rephrase your question mr. alakannuark ?
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i was thinking more when i said inuktitut curriculum , of survival out on the land and how to go hunting and how you survive out on the land especially in winter time .
also making traditional clothing such as caribou clothing .
in the past we used to utilize the traditional clothing more , but now it is not being used today and many young people are freezing to death , so that &apos;s my question .
mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
( interpretation ) thank you mr. speaker .
we &apos;ve only been a government for just a little over forty days but we &apos;ve already been discussing how the previous government was within nunavut .
i met with the baffin divisional board of education last night , to discuss this matter , or to discuss this issue .
we are committed to working on curriculum that could reflect the inuit culture , to utilize the inuit qaujimajatuqangit , whether it be in school , or whether it be technical .
i am requesting support on inuit knowledge , traditional knowledge to utilize these , how you survive on the land , but this will require a lot of preparation .
usually the system was such that each community was making their own educational curriculum in the community themselves without consulting with the other communities .
speaker :
( interpretation ) thank you mr. arvaluk .
do you still have questions mr. alakannuark ?
no ?
mr. kattuk , member for hudson bay .
question 11 - 1 ( 2 ) :
disputed islands in hudson bay
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) thank you mr. speaker .
i would like to ask this question about the disputed islands . i would like to direct this question to the government leader .
in the past we used to talk about the islands on the hudson bay with the nunavik people .
to date we are still , we still have a dispute on the islands .
the community of sanikiluaq is quite concerned about this because sanikiluaq is adjacent to the islands that are in dispute .
we are wondering if the community of sanikiluaq will be involved .
speaker :
( interpretation ) the question is posed to the premier .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik :

mr. irqittuq :
( interpretation ) thank you mr. speaker .
this is directed to the minister of education .
he may not be aware but i would like to ask him what has happened to the funds that have been slated for our school ?
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :

thank you mr. speaker .
introduction
mr. speaker , i am honoured to present our first government of nunavut budget .
across this country tradition has finance ministers delivering new budgets wearing new shoes .
in establishing a nunavut tradition , i am proud today to be wearing a pair of new caribou kamiks made by respected elder bessie omilgoetok of cambridge bay .
mr. speaker , new kamiks , a new budget , a new beginning .
this budget ensures the early success of our new territory .
it also provides a strong foundation on which we can build our future .
the needs of nunavummiut are great .
our expectations are high .
but like the journey taken by the founders of nunavut which led to the creation of our new territory , the meeting of those needs and the realization of those expectations will take time .
there is a great conviction on the part of all mlas to see that this happens in the least amount of time possible .
government programs and services will be reshaped as quickly as possible to better meet the needs of the people ;
and to better meet the vision of nunavut .
some changes to programs and services have been made already , and are reflected in our budget .
many other changes are in the planning stages and will be announced in the coming months .
other more substantive reforms will require careful study and extensive public consultations .
one option that does not exist is for us to fund new programs , services and capital projects without regard to our fiscal means and circumstances .
our fiscal plan
the government of nunavut is in the fortunate position of starting without an accumulated deficit , or debt load .
despite the attractiveness of borrowing money to finance current spending on needed government programs , services and capital projects , such actions would be short-sighted .
we must avoid the problems faced by other governments .
we are adopting a sound budgetary policy which will allow us to move towards improving the quality of life in nunavut .
most governments , including the federal government , have large accumulated debt loads .
the associated interest costs greatly reduce the amount of money that can be spent on health , education and other important social programs .
similar to other jurisdictions , here in the north we have seen the impact of reductions in spending on our social programs .
most governments in canada have experienced negative effects from financing current programs and services with borrowed money .
interest costs on borrowed money soon outweigh any short-term benefits .
we can and we will learn from their mistakes .
we plan to stay debt free .
mr. speaker , nunavut will have a balanced budget in the 1999-2000 fiscal year .
our fiscal plan projects revenues of $ 610 million and expenditures of $ 600 million .
we have a small 1.6 percent operating reserve to accommodate unforeseen expenditure increases or revenue declines .
our projected expenditures do not exceed projected revenues .
we do not plan to spend money we do not have .
we are not allocating expenditures from a potential positive opening financial balance for nunavut at this time .
the size of our opening balance will be determined when the division of assets and liabilities process with the government of the northwest territories is completed by october 1999 .
we currently do not know the final amount of this opening balance , but we do know that many of the assets will not be cash .
we also know that our opening balance will be reduced as a result of having to assume the financial obligations incurred by the office of the interim commissioner .
our fiscal plan focuses on the strengthening of our revenue base and the management of our expenditures in a manner which best meets the needs of our citizens , and the vision of nunavut .
prospects for improving our revenues from our own economic base are limited in the short-term , however future prospects are much brighter .
our forecast of revenues from taxes and fees account for approximately 9.5 percent of our total revenues .
we are projecting $ 57 million in own-source revenues this year .
our largest source is personal income tax , which we expect will bring in $ 16 million .
other sources include tobacco tax , payroll tax , corporate income tax , fuel tax , property tax , and school levies .
mr. speaker , i am pleased to announce that there will be no new taxes or fees in this budget .
nunavut , given our vast area , small population , and lack of a developed economic base , is very dependent upon federal fiscal transfers .
they will comprise about 90.5 percent of our revenues for the 1999-2000 fiscal year .
of the $ 553 million of revenues expected in federal transfers , $ 499 million will come through the formula financing grant .
the formula for this program is set for the first two years of the government of nunavut .
the level of these transfers is influenced by national factors such as growth in provincial expenditures , as well as by nunavut factors such as population and tax revenues .
the current structure of the formula hinders the government of nunavut in benefiting from revenues of future economic activities in the territory .
we will seek a better arrangement in the next negotiations .
the formula financing grant was intended to allow for the delivery of the same level of services in nunavut as was provided in the area previously by the government of the northwest territories .
it also made allowances for the additional headquarter costs in both territories .
although , the federal government provided transitional funding of $ 150 million , additional funding for infrastructure , social and cultural needs was not included in the formula financing grant .
we will continue with efforts to have our additional needs addressed through the formula financing grant , and through other federal transfers .
we are hopeful that a stronger national economy and an improved federal fiscal position , will allow room for positive federal responses .
mr. speaker , independent of our success on the revenue side , we plan to act in a responsible manner in our development of expenditures policies , and our delivery of programs and services .
being responsible means using our resources efficiently and effectively , setting priorities , making choices , being innovative , and being open to change .
as well it means operating in a fiscally responsible manner and living within our means .
we plan to reshape and manage government programs and services in a manner which best meets the needs of nunavummiut .
the achievement of these objectives will require the input of all members of this legislative assembly .
it will require the involvement and support of our other northern partners .
it will require the dedication and commitment of our employees .
above all , it will require the wisdom of the people of nunavut , particularly of our elders .
stability in our programs and services
mr. speaker , the reshaping of government programs and services to best meet the needs of nunavut is a complex task .
many reforms will take considerable time and energies .
the continuity in the delivery of programs and services used daily by the people of nunavut is a major priority of the budget .
to help ensure that all programs are delivered as cost-effectively as possible many headquarters and other administrative functions have been streamlined and will be delivered by central government departments .
this includes information technology , financial processing and human resources services .
this approach to internal organization will enable program departments to focus on the provision of programs and services beneficial to the public .
the budget allocates $ 545 million on government programs and services .
an additional $ 55 million will be spent on capital projects throughout nunavut , including nearly $ 20 million on social housing .
the departments of health and social services , education , and community government , housing and transportation account for over 60 percent of nunavut &apos;s spending on programs and services .
the departments of public works , telecommunications and technical services , justice and sustainable development account for another 25 percent .
mr. speaker , i will now highlight some of the departmental spending initiatives for this year .
the department of finance and administration will continue the electrical power subsidy to ensure that all nunavut residents continue to have access to reasonable utility rates .
this will cost $ 3.8 million .
the department of justice will continue to provide $ 830,000 to support nunavut &apos;s 3 regional legal aid clinics .
the department of community government , housing and transportation will continue to provide assistance to hamlets in meeting their operational costs through the municipal operating assistance program .
this program will contribute $ 18.7 million in this fiscal year .
in addition $ 5.2 million will be provided to communities to help offset the high cost of water and sewage services to local residents .
the department of culture , language , elders and youth will provide $ 1.8 million in grants to art councils and cultural organizations .
the department of education will provide $ 72.4 million to territorial schools , $ 13.6 million to nunavut arctic college , plus $ 28 million for income support .
it will also add 17 teaching positions across nunavut by reprofiling current expenditures .
this will help the department to accommodate the increased number of students and maintain its present level of service .
the department of health and social services will provide $ 44.4 million to support hospital insurance services in nunavut .
as well , it will contribute $ 4.9 million to community wellness programs .
the department of sustainable development will provide $ 12.5 million in grants and contributions to a wide variety of associations and organizations .
these contributions include :
$ 1.3 million to nunavut tourism , $ 1.0 million to the nunavut business development fund , $ 1.8 million for community initiatives funding , and $ 2.9 million to the nunavut development corporation .
the capital program for 1999-2000 incorporates projects where contractual arrangements were in place by the gnwt .
also included are projects having legal or regulatory requirements , or involving health and safety concerns .
social housing projects and projects supported by federal contributions , insurance claims or other external funding sources were given priority .
the use of these criteria allowed us to initiate a capital program in time to meet the 1999 construction season .
in the coming months we will be starting a 5-year capital planning program , which will involve extensive consultations with mlas , along with communities .
in addition to the capital program outlined in our budget , there will be many other construction programs carried out this fiscal year .
the government of canada will be providing $ 9.3 million in funding for water reservoir improvements , sewer lagoon improvements , and other capital projects .
nunavut construction company ( ncc ) will continue a major office building and housing program in support of our decentralization plans throughout nunavut .
in addition , we are actively pursuing private-public partnering arrangements to provide much needed health and education facilities in our communities .
by partnering with nunavut &apos;s business community we can develop local expertise and skills , create employment , and maximize the benefits from our resources , while building our needed infrastructure .
our budget provides a stable environment to plan for nunavut &apos;s future , it allows us to begin addressing the challenges we face and the priorities of our people .
our environment and challenges
there are major geographic , demographic , social and economic challenges that we have to contend with in order to improve the lives of nunavummiut .
our territory encompasses almost one-quarter of the land mass of canada , with a population of approximately 26,000 residents .
our 28 communities are only accessible year round by air , or by ship during the short summer season .
our geography causes the cost of providing essential programs and services to be very expensive .
an example of this is the $ 15.4 million we must use to provide transportation for our people to access health services not readily available in our communities .
our population is growing three times faster than the canadian average , 64 percent of our people are under the age of 30 and more than 45 percent are under 20 .
this creates ever increasing demands and pressures for health and education services , as well as for housing and other social programs .
in our largest social program education and health and social services , we have started the process of reform .
planning for efficiencies between departments and board administrations is a major step in that reform .
we also know that recruitment and retention of staff in these important program areas needs to be addressed as a priority .
both the honourable james arvaluk and the honourable ed picco are committed to dealing with these initiatives and the task of ongoing reform .
we are looking at ways we might work with the federal government to address the shortage of new social housing .
the cmhc funding we have in place will decrease over the next 20 years , so finding new ways of dealing with this matter is crucial .
the honourable jack anawak , minister of community government transportation and housing has recently announced an extension of the minimum down payment assistance program .
this program provides nunavut residents with a grant of up to $ 15,000 to use as a down payment to purchase an existing home .
the availability of adequate and affordable housing to meet the needs of our growing population is one of our highest infrastructure priorities .
the nunavut court of justice has been established .
this is a single level of court that is unique in canada .
along with this there will be increased support for justices of the peace so more cases can be dealt with by community members within their own communities .
meeting our social challenges will require a commitment on the part of our government and the people of nunavut .
we know that in nunavut we have an economy that is unique in canada , one that affords great opportunity for development .
our government holds that all our people should be able to participate fully in these economic development opportunities .
nunavut has enormous natural resource development potential .
last year the mineral exploration industry invested more than $ 70 million here .
we are committed to improving employment opportunities across nunavut and we will continue to support economic activity that is based on our traditional way of life .
later this session the honourable peter kilabuk , minister of sustainable development , will address in some detail the issue of the development of our economy .
this budget provides additional financial support for a nunavut prospector program , a nunavut arts and crafts association , harvester support programs , and community economic development .
economic development depends in part on our ability to attract investment , both private and public .
the nunavut land claims agreement provides a stable economic environment , in addition to our resource potential .
as a result , private investor confidence is strong .
we must look to the federal government for a high level of partnership and commitment in our economy .
the government of nunavut is working with federal officials to act now on their public commitment to develop a &quot; northern economic strategy . &quot;
we are working to establish an economic development agreement between the government of canada and nunavut .
we await a positive response from our federal partners on several current economic initiatives , which are crucial to the growth of our economy .
these include infrastructure development , a partnership on geoscience , and negotiations on the development of our fisheries .
we must encourage our partners , in both the public and private sectors , to invest in the diverse economic opportunities we have throughout nunavut .
and we must consult with the people of nunavut to ask for their participation in planning the development of our economy .
if we plan well and make effective choices , nunavut will have a bright future .
making changes
the choices we make in the coming months will greatly affect our future .
we must take the time necessary to ensure that our changes make programs and services better suited to nunavut &apos;s needs and vision .
we have to be realistic in our expectations .
priorities will have to be established .
i want to assure you mr. speaker that over the coming months we will consult with mla &apos;s and the people of nunavut in considering any and all future plans .
we realize expectations are high and the desire for change is well founded .
however , changes will take time to implement .
but be assured that our government is committed to change .
a key will be our ability to be resourceful , innovative , and more efficient .
we will have to do many things differently .
a good example is the recently announced amalgamation of health and social service boards into the department of health and social service , and the divisional education boards into the department of education .
another good example is the decision to pursue private public partnering arrangements to provide some of our capital needs .
one of the most important elements in the delivery of programs are our employees .
the nunavut employees union , which represent the largest number of employees , has indicated that they would like to reopen negotiations for the current agreement which expires march 31 , 2000 .
the other union , the federation of nunavut teachers , has already given notice to begin the collective bargaining process .
their current agreement expires august 31 , 1999 .
we will examine with the unions more innovative ways of compensating employees .
however , we must be aware that the outcome of these negotiations will have an impact on our current and future budgets .
key to meeting nunavut &apos;s challenges will be how to manage all the future pressures for funding from limited financial resources .
questions will have to be asked about how best to do things .
the government can not answer these questions alone .
input will be sought from the people of nunavut .
together we will make the necessary decisions in the best interest of our land and its people .
if we incorporate the knowledge of our people , particularly our elders and community leaders , we can establish a path that is right .
our task , as government , will be to work with the people in all our communities to find the best way to move forward .
this will take time but we will move forward .
knowing where we spend money now will have an influence on where we set priorities in the future .
doing something new will mean changing the way programs and services are currently provided .
before we make any changes to our programs and services we must know the impact that such changes would have on the people of nunavut .
we must be mindful of inuit qaujimajutuqangit ( iq ) in what and how we do things .
whatever the situation , change will only be introduced after the people of nunavut have been consulted .
the issue is not whether changes will be necessary , but rather when and what changes will be implemented .
establishing our priorities
one of the most challenging tasks for any government is to identify priorities that matter to people and would make a difference in their lives .
our government will address this challenge in a manner befitting the efforts that have led to the creation of our territory .
there are three broad goals for the government of nunavut - establishing a more appropriate and better government ;
creating healthy communities , families , and individuals ;
and becoming more self-reliant .
with regard to better and more appropriate government , we will consult widely and listen to our people .
the people of nunavut must be able to identify with all orders of government - municipal , territorial and federal .
our government will become more accessible , less complex and more effective .
we will work hard at improving our social programs .
government will help provide the means for people and communities to make meaningful improvements in their daily lives .
our approach will be wide and varied - from improvements to social housing , to better education programs , and more effective health programs .
again , we will listen to our people to tailor a nunavut strategy for developing healthier communities , healthier families , and healthier individuals to overcome our social challenges .
to improve the daily lives of our people we also will need to become more self-reliant .
this will mean more employment opportunities , it will mean investments in education and training of our human resources , it will mean investments in improving the overall health and well-being of our citizens .
we will have to work closely with nti and other organizations to foster an atmosphere of trust and cooperation .
we will have to get more from our resources .
this means using our present resources wisely while pursuing new resources .
we are committed to the negotiation of an agreement with the federal government that would enable nunavut to share in the prosperity of its natural resources .
such an agreement would be a bold step forward , enabling our government to be more self sufficient and less reliant on federal transfers in the future .
establishing our priorities will enable nunavut to have a successful beginning .
in mid june after the budget session , there will be a caucus strategic planning retreat to deal with setting priorities as another step towards change .
conclusions
the needs of nunavummiut are great , and they will be met .
like the journey undertaken by the founders of nunavut , we will need some time .
we are committed to orderly change to ensure that our policies as well as programs and services will best meet the needs of our people .
we will consult , we will listen and we will initiate change , change that will have long lasting benefit to all nunavummiut . &gt; &gt; applause

mr. ng
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , first of all we have to assess what &apos;s there and take an assessment now on the levels of the employees throughout the nunavut public sector .
that is on the stream and so i can say that we &apos;ll probably have more information by the time the budget goes before the house .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :

we are very committed to meeting regularly with nti .
we received correspondence from nti not too long ago about trying to initiate an agreement with them on how we are going to deal with each other .
we are trying to work on a response .
currently they have a political accord with the prior government , the northwest territories government , which will expire on june 30 .
we are hoping to conclude an agreement prior to that time .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :

mr. irqittuq .
question 17 - 1 ( 2 ) :
required qualifications for government positions
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i didn &apos;t hear you properly the first time .
mr. speaker i would like to ask a question to the minister of finance .
regarding the new jobs that are being created by the nunavut government and new hires that will come into play .
what kind of qualifications are you looking for in the new hires that you are hiring ?
are you going to require them to have a bunch of credentials ?

hon. paul okalik :
mr. speaker , i believe the question is more directed to the minister of human resources .
speaker :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
there &apos;s a lot of different positions throughout government of course , and the qualifications for each job are different .
that &apos;s the main focus of what we are trying to do in order to expand the work force to be more representative of the people that government serves .
thank you .

thank you mr. ng .
mr. irqittuq do you have any additional questions ?

construction of road to keewatin
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question is directed to the premier .
the road that we were talking about yesterday in keewatin .
my question ;
is that road viable for all of nunavut , would it benefit all of the residents of nunavut ?
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
we have no highway whatsoever in nunavut from southern canada .
i think that once we have a highway anywhere in nunavut i think that it can benefit all the residents of nunavut , in terms of cost savings .
i think it can benefit everybody in nunavut .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
mr. iqaqrialu second question .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
the funds that will be expended for the study , would that come from nunavut government budget ?
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
yes thank you mr. speaker .
i cannot answer the details at this time as we are still in the preliminary stages of discussions .
first of all we will be talking to people who will be directly impacted by the construction of the road , and we &apos;re still having preliminary discussions with the federal government .
we don &apos;t know the details at this time .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you mr. premier .
do you have supplementary questions mr. iqaqrialu ?
thank you , oral questions , mr. kattuk .
question 19 - 1 ( 2 ) :
federal firearms control legislation
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question will be directed to the premier .
as a hunter in nunavut , all the hunters are experiencing difficulties in terms of trying to obtain firearms for hunting .
my question is what is the government planning to do with the new gun law ?
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
we are still trying to come up with a plan , what kind of action we are going to be taking about the gun law .
yukon , nwt and alberta went before the courts to challenge the legislation .
the bill is currently before the supreme court of canada and we are still exploring different ways of approaching this new law .

ministers &apos; statement 9 - 1 ( 2 ) :
north american fur and fashion expedition
hon. peter kilabuk :
thank you mr. speaker .
i would like to reply to a comment that was made on may 13 , 1999 by glenn mclean , member from baker lake .
mr. mclean was kind enough to acknowledge my participation in the north american fur and fashion exposition , held earlier this month may 5th . to 8th . 1999 .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
please sit down .
i apologize , it was my mistake , you may go ahead and do your ministers &apos; statement mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk :
thank you mr. speaker .
i &apos;ll go on from where i left off .
first , mr. speaker , i want to thank the member for baker lake for his generous remarks .
the north american fur and fashion exposition provided nunavut with an opportunity to show our pride in our hunters , and the importance of our sealskin by-products .
i was proud to be there , to represent our people , and to speak about the importance of sealskin and other furs to our way of life .
mr. speaker , i have no hesitation about educating the public outside of nunavut concerning the sale of our by-products such as sealskins .
i believe it is our job to educate people about seal hunting in nunavut .
it is our job to stand up for our culture .
i am not at all reluctant to further educate lobby organizations , with the facts to further promote our lifestyle and culture .
in nunavut , mr. speaker , our use of wildlife is today , as it always has been , sustainable .
our seal hunt is a humane harvest .
and every part of the seal we hunt is used - for our food , and for our clothing .
this is our tradition .
this is our culture .
our people have the right to continue this way of life , and to hunt seal for their livelihoods .
on the first day of the fur show , mr. speaker , i addressed a news conference on the topic . &quot; the importance of wildlife use for people on the land &quot; .
this was followed by an interview on canadian television and by the american press .
that evening , more than seven hundred people attended a fashion show and dinner , described as a &quot; tribute to nunavut &quot; .
the fashion show featured &quot; the nunavut collection , &quot; twenty-three beautiful sealskin coats .
during the show i received a commemorative plaque from the fur council of canada and the north american fur and fashion exposition .
the inscription on the plaque reads , mr. speaker : &quot; to the people of nunavut :
canada &apos;s first furrier . &quot;
&gt; &gt; applause
the following day , mr. speaker , i was able to speak with children at a school in montreal , and to explain how inuit use the seal .
this message was taken to three other schools in the montreal area .
later that day my department sponsored a reception at the fur show , which was attended by more than three hundred people .
i believe , mr. speaker , our message is getting through .
at the montreal show , &quot; the nunavut collection &quot; sold out .
&gt; &gt; applause
i &apos;m told there were many , many orders taken .
our hunters , our people , were recognized and applauded for the sustainable and humane way we conduct our seal hunt .
our message is being heard , by more and more people , around the world .
our nunavut sealing strategy , mr. speaker , is making progress .
mr. speaker , to continue making progress our government must challenge the current trade restrictions that are imposed in the u.s.
through the marine mammal protection act . the sealing strategy developed by our department highlights our cultural background , economic opportunities and educational initiatives for both harvester and purchaser .
ms. aaju peter from iqaluit made a series of excellent presentations in the montreal schools .
thank you mr. speaker
&gt; &gt; applause
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kilabuk .
ministers statements , minister havioyak .
ministers &apos; statement 10 - 1 ( 2 ) :
repatriation of inuit artifacts to nunavut
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
mr. speaker , i would like to take this opportunity to speak on the need to return our artifacts to nunavut .
over the last century many anthropologists and explorers visited our country and were amazed by our artifacts .
they took the liberty remove these artifacts , our tools , our clothing , even the bones of our deceased relatives , and bring them back to their homes to studied and displayed .
as a result of these items being taken , nunavut is empty of our precious properties .
okakti , the artifacts represent our history , the possessions of our ancestors , they represent the way our great grandfathers and mothers lives .
they represent inuit qaujimajatuqangit .
with the people who removed them our artifacts have travelled far and wide and have taken their places on display and in storage areas of many universities and museums .
most of these institutions believe that they came upon these artifacts honestly and feel very possessive of these artifacts .
most institutions have preserved these items with great care .
from that point of view , i am proud of the way they been preserved .
but , we need them back .
my department has been tasked as the guardian of our inuit culture and heritage .
my department wishes to ensure that the inuit culture and heritage is defended and preserved .
my department wants to ensure that many of the items that have been removed from our homeland be returned to nunavut .
in order to bring back any artifacts , nunavut has to have sufficient storage space to locate these items .
mr. speaker , we need a heritage centre in nunavut ! my honourable colleagues , we need your support in pursuing this important initiative .
our department is working with birthright corporations in nunavut to promote our objective .
discussions have started between our department and with nunavut tunngavik incorporated , and with inuit heritage trust .
through inuit qaujimajatuqangit we want to promote and reinforce community identity .
we want to work with inuit organizations and nunavut communities to design the programs that would be housed in this nunavut heritage centre and how we can share these programs throughout our territory .
our partners and i are committed to pursuing the requirement for a central facility which we in nunavut can gain knowledge from our past and be educated for the future . koana , okakti .

return to oral question 1 - 1 ( 2 ) :
question 3 - 1 ( 2 ) incorporating inuit culture into government
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
yes thank you mr. speaker .
on may 12 , mr. kevin o &apos;brien asked a question about inuit qaujimatuqangit .
this member asked me a certain question and this is the answer to the question .
( interpretation ends ) .
inuit traditional knowledge is obviously going to cost a certain amount of money .
first let me say that iq is the work of various nunavut partners .
iq was first discussed during the meeting of the elders that took place in igloolik in march 1998 .
this meeting was sponsored by the nunavut social development council under the article 32 in the nunavut land claims agreement .
mr. speaker the government of nunavut is a member of the working group committee of the nunavut social development council .
our department was designated as a member of the working group .
our mandate is to report our findings to the government of nunavut on inuit qaujimatuqangit .
to date we have been discussing the topic of iq with other government departments within the government of nunavut .
our discussions have been based on the ideas of incorporating iq into other departments .
this topic of iq is going to be a long-term program which will be eventually be utilized by most of the government departments in the government of nunavut .
it is going to take time , however we are going to have it more understood by the government personnel through various means of communication .
with respect to the question of funding , i am unable to answer the question until some time when the legislative assembly reviews the estimates and approves the bill .
thank you

thank you .
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
when you are trying to go to the baffin region from keewatin , we have no mode of transportation directly .
airline travel being the only way to go , you have to go through a roundabout way to get here and airline travel is very expensive .
i think we can look at alternative ways with more direct routes than there is now .
i realize , minister , that you are new to this as we are , and we expect that you will do something about this in the future .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. anawak would you be able to respond to that ?
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
yes , as i said , we are having preliminary discussions at this time , not just for kitikmeot and baffin regions , we are also looking at keewatin .
we are looking at building a highway to keewatin and we realize there can be better routing of the airlines either from repulse bay or gjoa haven to keewatin and baffin regions .
i still have to meet with the transportation officials .
thank you .

question 25 - 1 ( 2 ) :
arena for kimmirut
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
this is a question to minister anawak .
for a long time the people of kimmirut have been trying to get an arena , maybe for up to fifteen years .
the community had heard that this arena was going to be built this year , but now we are hearing something else .
i wonder what is happening with that project ?
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
yes , i am sorry , he asked me this question a few days ago and i made a mistake when i was responding to that .
i sent a letter to him last week about the proposed arena and i had a meeting with the mayor and council recently about that also .
they told me what they want to do and asked if i could help them with that .
i asked them to write a proposal and get a letter of support from the community , so i have already responded to that and we are working on that question .

thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
i am not too clear what the question is , perhaps he could clarify it ?
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. alakannuark , perhaps you could clarify the question ?
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
we are talking about the country food that can be provided for sale as dried meat , frozen or canned .
there are different ways of preparing country food which could be provided to the people of nunavut .
i am wondering if that is being considered .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
the question the member has asked about , the nunavut government , we have some country food available where they have been processed in nunavut .
we want to see more of that .
one of the examples he used was dried meat , smoked meat or canned food .
we are encouraging the residents of nunavut to come up with these ideas and to start businesses .
if people want more information about what to do to start these kinds of business , they are welcome to come up to our department .

report 1 - 1 ( 2 ) :
community empowerment &amp; sustainable development , review of departmental business plans 1999 / 2000
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. speaker .
bear with me , my colleagues .
this was a last minute opportunity for me here .
the standing committee on community empowerment &amp; sustainable development report on the review of draft departmental business plans , preliminary information on the 1999 / 2000 main estimates .
the committees &apos; report reflects the unique circumstances surrounding its &apos; review of the 1999 / 2000 draft departmental business plans .
many of the committees &apos; general observations and comments will be reflected in the reports of the other standing committees .
mr. speaker less than a month after the creation of nunavut , the standing committees met to review the draft 3 year business plans of the departments of the government of nunavut .
this work was carried out during the week of april 26 and involved appearances by all ministers .
members of the committees had the opportunity to ask questions of ministers and their senior officials .
the standing committees of the legislative assembly were constituted at the first sitting of the assembly on april 1 .
the committee has the following general observations and comments .
it should be recognized that the review process occurred in a uniquely short period of time .
it contrasts to the practices in the western assembly where the review of business plans and main estimates takes place over a period of several months .
members of the standing committees here had much less time .
indeed we fully recognize that ministers themselves had very short timelines to familiarize themselves with their departments .
mr. speaker , the committee recognizes that the budget process this year has been unique .
both the 1999 / 2000 departmental estimates and capital plans were substantially decided upon prior to all members having the opportunity to make input .
members were disappointed at the lack of clarity provided as to how some decisions were arrived at .
we expect that the budget cycle for next year will involve significantly greater consultation , both with regular members and with the communities .
over the course of the week of the committees &apos; deliberations , the amount and level of detail of information provided by the departments improved greatly .
however , it is our expectation that the information flow from the departments to the committees will improve in terms of time lines and level of detail as capacity is built within the departments .
we also recognize that the capacity of departments to translate all materials into inuktitut is , at present , limited .
it is our expectation that efforts will be made to ensure that capacity development in this regard is treated as a matter of priority of this government .
mr. speaker , the committee noted that draft business plans were inconsistent in terms of the level of detail contained .
it has been pointed out that the people of nunavut need to have clear expectations of what the government can deliver .
departments have a role to play in communicating clearly what expectations are realistic given the constraints that are facing us .
however , there appears to be as yet little progress yet in defining and operationalizing this concept in any particular , or systematic way .
the success of its &apos; implementation depends upon people at all levels of government having a clear understanding of the concept and its &apos; critical importance .
the committee were encouraged to hear ministers &apos; speak of the need to establish a close working relationship with the regular members &apos; of the assembly .
the committee hopes that this commitment will be reflected in the way the government responds to our concerns and recommendations .
regular members look forward to making a strong , positive contribution to this government .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
just a reminder .
when the committees are reporting please hold down your chat , in respect to the members , when they are reporting , please listen .

my budget was sent to the committee of the whole .
the budget recommended for the department of finance and administration is in the 99 / 2000 main estimates .
the department of finance and administration is a central department that provides financial and administrative services to the government of nunavut .
it also has responsibilities for the overall fiscal and economic management of our new territory .
the department has a proposed budget of 27.5 million dollars .
the budget of the department includes the funding for many services that have government wide application as well as funding support services delivered by other departments .
financial processing services are also heavily centralized in the department .
this has resulted in efficiencies and has allowed more dollars to be spent by government on programs and services directly benefiting people .
the budget of the department is organized into five categories .
directorate , fiscal policy and expenditure management , financial services , informatics , and a comptrollership .
the directorate is comprised of a deputy minister , assistant deputy minister , assistant comptroller general , and the executive secretaries .
it is responsible for the overall management of the department and has a recommended budget of 825 thousand dollars .
fiscal policy and expenditure management includes responsibilities for fiscal policy development , intergovernmental fiscal relations , and negotiations , taxation , budgeting , and provision of support to the financial management board .
this branch has a budget of 3 million dollars including 500 thousand in support of 3p initiatives and 1.1 million dollars for start up funding for the business credit corporation .
financial services ensures that proper financial processes and controls are in place in the departments , boards and agencies .
it performs financial analysis of major policy initiatives .
it is also responsible for development and monitoring of the budget of the department .
the recommended budget for financial services is 1.2 million dollars .
informatics is responsible for the information technology standards and policies for the government as well as the development and initial training related to new applications and major modifications to systems .
informatics has a recommended budget of 4.5 million including 4 million for systems development .
the comptrollership function accounts for 65 % of the budget recommended for the department .
the comptrollership function includes the government accounting division , investment and risk management division and three regional operations .
it has responsibility for financial processing , payroll financial reporting , financial controls , cash management and banking , and risk management .
the department currently has about 65 positions filled out of it &apos;s total staff complement of 131 positions .
nearly 50 % of the staff are inuit .
mr. chairman , i will now conclude by stating that the department of finance and administration has made a lot of progress in meeting its &apos; broad mandate .
the budget appropriation requested in the main estimates will enable the department to meet its objectives in 99 / 2000 .
thank you .
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
do you have any further comments ?
perhaps mr. ng , would you like to get one of your officials at the witness chair with you ?
hon. kelvin ng :
yes , mr. chairman .
chairperson : perhaps the minister of finance along with his officials , maybe he could introduce his officials please .
perhaps the chairman of the government operations , has a standing committee report to do ?
mr. akesuk :
thank you mr. chairman , i will report in english .
minister ng appeared before the committee on the morning of april 29th .
the main estimate summary provided to the committee indicated a total 99 / 2000 expenditure of 27 million , 547 thousand , 673 dollars .
as with the department of the executive and governmental affairs , the committee recognizes the role finance and administration plays as a central agency .
the department mandate is to provide the government of nunavut with advice on matters relating to fiscal management and to ensure efficient government wide management of financial resources .
citizen involvement in budget development .
the committee was intrigued at the draft business plans reference to providing for public information in the budget formulation process .
the committee will be supportive of efforts to hold community workshops in which members participate in hearing the view of the public .
the committee also recommends that the department make an effort to provide clear budget information to elders and the public .
the committee appreciated receiving a detailed briefing on federal / nunavut fiscal relations .
the committee is supportive of the departments &apos; mandate to aggressively pursue revenue enhancement opportunities with the government of canada .
the committee was also advised that these costs are offset in the ffa .
the committee recommends that the department continue to make strong efforts in these areas .
the committee would also like to be regularly updated as the department identifies one- time or unforeseen costs associated with establishing the new government .
the committee would like to receive a full accounting of these costs to the government of nunavut .
the committee also recognizes that a number of issues may not have been finalized yet .
the committee takes a strong interest in these issues and requests regular updates as information emerges .
upcoming negotiations with unions .
the department in collaboration with human resources has responsibility for negotiating public service agreements .
the committee would also like to be kept updated on developments in respect to pay equity issues .

thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
comments and questions to the motion .
in respect to the motion , all those in favour ?
abstentions , all those against .
i am making a few mistakes , as this is my first time .
the motion is carried .
mr. akesuk , do you have any further items ?
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman , that is all .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
comments to the department of finance and administration .
mr. iqaqrialu ?
mr. iqaqrialu ?
mr. iqaqrialu : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i would prefer that maybe after they make a report i will have a few things to state or should i pose my question now ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
the minister already made his report and now it is open for comments and questions mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ?
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
in respect to the deficits that they alluded to which is the 4 million dollars for the oic .
we were told where it had come from , and it affects the nunavut government because even before we were up and running there was a deficit outstanding .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
minister ng ?
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu did that answer your question or do you have any further comments ?
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
that way it is creating a problem unless it is clarified both to the mlas because they have to understand for what the payables have been incurred .
because we never did the work of the office of the interim commissioner , so i just wanted to state that again , mr. chairman .
thank you .
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , once the final audit is complete and the accounting for the financial affairs of the office of the interim commissioner there will be a breakdown of the expenditures under that office .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
further comments mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
i would like to see that in our future meetings .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
is that just a comment or do you want to answer that mr. minister .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman we have little choice in the matter .
unfortunately it is a legal agreement .
the office of the interim commissioner had the mandate through the nunavut act to operate and do the preparatory work for the establishment of the government of nunavut .
once the government of nunavut took office on april 1st , became a legal entity , the office of the interim commission dissolved .
i mean , obviously it would have been ideal if that wasn &apos;t the situation , but unfortunately that is the matter that we have to deal with and the legal obligation is there .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
in respect to the same item or within the same arena , in respect to the deficit of the oic which was stated to be 4.4 million dollars .
was that the case , where we had to take away capital projects in order to pay this 4.4 million-dollar deficit ?
hon. kelvin ng :
no mr. chairman that wasn &apos;t the case .
what this affects is the opening balance of the government of nunavut .
in effect it is a liability that is offset against the assets that would be coming over from the division of the assets and liabilities with the g.n.w.t.
it doesn &apos;t affect the current year , the 99 / 2000 fiscal year per se .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
i guess my question is just wondering , in the report the audit that the minister alluded to , will there be in there explanation as to how such a sizeable deficit was obtained ?
if that will be pointed out in the report .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
which of you would like to answer this question ?
hon. kelvin ng :
--
so we will have to wait just like anybody else the outcome of what &apos;s in that and what kind of comments or recommendations that they might have .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
if you &apos;re just going to wait is there something that the department will be asking their federal counterparts as to how they let it slide for the 4.4 million dollars over ?
thank you mr. chairman .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
they also have a chance to dialogue with the auditor generals &apos; staff as they move forward analyzing the report .
thank you .
chairperson interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman . i guess that still doesn &apos;t answer .
chairperson :
mr. ng
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , there has been some discussions , but i think also that the premier has brought up the issue with the minister of diand and spoken to her about it .
but as it stands now , until the final results are in , i think things are kind of in a state of waiting until the final report is out mr. chairman .
thank you .
thank you mr. chairman . mr. chairman it is an accrued liability .
as i indicated it &apos;ll off set some of the assets that we have coming over from the gnwt in the division of assets and liabilities .
there are plans to go forward and try to recoup some of those costs .
whether or not we &apos;re successful there &apos;s another matter i guess , but it &apos;s certainly an issue .
thank you mr. mclean . please recognize the chair , because you &apos;ll have to recognize me as i am the chair .
chairperson ( interpretation ) : minister or his deputy or his assistant deputy minister .
mr. chairman thank you .
mr. chairman it isn &apos;t a 99 / 2000 year expenditure .
it &apos;s an opening balance liability , because this is the first time we set up and it &apos;s an opening balance sheet item .
it &apos;ll reduce that balance that was coming over though as far as the opening balance goes .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. minister you &apos;ve indicated in your budget , in reference to revenues , it includes 3 million dollars in revenue from property taxes of school levies .
will this money go back into general revenue or does it go back to the communities where we generated it from ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
minister of finance &amp; administration .
i really want to give you an inuktitut name .
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
as long as it &apos;s a good one .
mr. chairman , all revenues that the members see there go into the general consolidated revenue fund and are disbursed based on appropriations through the assembly and the recommendations of the government .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. o &apos;brien
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
another tax question .
in reference to the payroll tax .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
minister of finance &amp; administration .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
it returns more to lower income earners than what it takes in .
they get a rebate back and i believe that it &apos;s 1 1 / 4 % instead of 1 % for the lower income earners within the territory .
so that &apos;s another issue that would have to be taken into consideration of the review of this specific tax .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. minister are you considering any new tax reform initiatives over the next year .
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
minister of finance &amp; administration . mr. ng
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i want to pose this question to minister of finance &amp; administration or his , i don &apos;t know who &apos;s responsible for this .
are the hamlets , i think some of them are leery because their budgets are getting cut and they &apos;re concerned that their budgets might be cut for their operational funding .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. alakannuark , you may answer this if you wish or we could wait for a response until we get to the minister of municipal and community affairs .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
i think i tried to indicate in my opening comments that we &apos;ve tried to provide as much stability as possible during the course of this years operation .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
that &apos;s it .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. minister your budget address sets out an important goal of the government of the nunavut to have a balanced budget , this is very important .
how will your department ensure that other departments do not go over their budget ?
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
minister of finance &amp; administration . mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , we plan to be monitoring the expenditures on a regular basis of the other departments .
in fact right now we &apos;re providing a lot of the financial support services for those departments , because they don &apos;t have their financial management sections up and running fully yet .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
minister of finance &amp; administration , mr. ng
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
so , yes there are situations where that happens .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
those types of deficits will they have an impact on the government of the nunavuts &apos; budgets , as ultimately they receive their funding from the government .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
minister of finance and administration . mr. ng
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
minister ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , obviously if we are to take over responsibilities for those specific boards , we would assume the liabilities or the assets in that kind of circumstances for their operations .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i guess this is a last question .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i guess in light of all that , has your department or have you considered introducing balanced budget legislation ?
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. ng
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , as some members know , the northwest territories and other jurisdiction have balanced budget legislation and that could restrict going into too much deficit .
it is something we can look at , at some point .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
now the nunavut government as you are looking at the operations , we have to look at the holiday pay and benefits .
what are your plans for re-implementing the benefits packages our employees use to have .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. minister you may answer this or if you prefer it just be deferred to the human resources minister .
hon. kelvin ng :
i &apos;ll speak on his behalf i think .
mr. chairman , there are no plans to reinstate any of the benefits that were eroded when the government of the northwest territories underwent their deficit strategy in trying to curtail their spending .
i think it &apos;s safe to say that we know that there &apos;s expectations amongst the two major unions .
once the collective bargaining process begins , will have to wait until the positions are formally tabled and the negotiations are hopefully , successfully , concluded .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
in some ways it was beneficial where some of the benefits were cut because of other residents in nunavut who did not have those benefits .
still past employees miss those benefits and they &apos;re expected to have them reinstated .
i would ask a person be appointed or you work with employees unions , that there be a working committees struck to review this issue .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. ng :
we &apos;re going to be waiting until human resources comes up .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
my question to the minister relates to forced growth and i &apos;d like to know what the minister has factored into the budget regarding forced growth , what &apos;s the status on this issue ?
chairperson :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. o &apos;brien
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. minister i believe you indicated that there &apos;s was approximately 10 million dollars in the reserve .
chairperson :
mr. ng
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. o &apos;brien
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
just one final question in reference to this area .
talking about forced growth and the 10 million dollars that we have now in reserve , and some of the factors that will cause some concerns in the coming months .
how has the minister considered the decentralized modelled in reference to this budget .
we see the decentralized model as probably the corner stone , one of the corner stones of the nunavut government .
so how has the minister incorporated this into his overall budget .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. ng
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , within the departmental budgets now , i have the understanding that they are funded to the levels of the decentralized model .
thank you .
mr. o &apos;brien :
mr. chairman , we &apos;ll hold the minister to that .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. kattuk
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. ng
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman i am just asking if you are going to provide detailed information on how you are going to collect taxes .
thank you .
hon. kelvin ng :
mr. chairperson , yes we will provide the information if it is the detail that the honourable member is asking for in respect to how it is collected .
we will also provide the breakdown of the categories .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
any further comments ?
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
minister , just a question in reference to one of the pension plans that was set up by the former government and how it relates to this government here .
would the nunavut government see any portion of that 9 million dollars .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
minister ng or one of his officials .
hon. kelvin ng :
so we will get our 44 % portion .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , in reference to the division of assets and liabilities .
hon. kelvin ng :
mr. chairperson , i &apos;ll ask mr. tootoo to speak to that one , as he was heavily involved in the aspects of that .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
the agreement itself has been signed for some time , it &apos;s in the implementation stage .
i was personally involved with the negotiations around the agreement and up until the signing and slightly afterwards .
now for the implementation , there is an implementation committee set up to administer the agreement .
rod malcolm is here today as well , he &apos;s the assistant comptroller general , and he &apos;s nunavuts &apos; lead representative on the implementation committee for the division of assets and liabilities .
he and his staff are the ones who will be ensuring that the agreement is implemented in the spirit it was negotiated and that nunavut gets its &apos; fair share .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairperson .
it &apos;s my understanding that this government is to enter agreements , rather to contracts , of approximately 50 % plus , services i guess from the gnwt .
can the minister tell members how that is impacting on this government ?
chairperson :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairperson .
so , they have the staffing dollars that are going to be used for the contracting fees .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson :
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson :
mr. minister .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairperson .
mr. chairperson , each department made their own contractual arrangements for services .
but , generally speaking , i would think that they would be more of a cost because there would be some administrative fees on top of providing the services back to our government .
thank you .
chairperson :
thank you .
i believe those are just comments .
anything else further ?
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
in reference to the same question that was brought up in regards to contracting back to the territorial government .
i believe that it &apos;s going to cost more , and i hope to see the nunavut legislative assembly seek contractors within the nunavut area instead of going outside of the nunavut territory .
i believe that we will have to work hard to find contractors because of course we will be spending more in the long run if we contract the territorial government .
chairperson :
mr. minister .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairperson .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
iqaqrialu , is that all ?
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) : yes .
i apologize mr. chairperson .
thank you mr. chairperson .
we have to look at ways and means as to how we can increase our economic development around the nunavut area .
chairperson :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairperson .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i wanted to return to a previous issue in regards to income tax .
as we heard , income taxes that are being deducted from both the federal and territorial government , does that mean that we will also be deducting a nunavut income tax from our salaries ?
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson :
mr. minister .
hon. kelvin ng :
yes , mr. chairperson , the nunavut income tax is a percentage of the federal tax that &apos;s collected .
so , we set the nunavut personal income tax rate and it &apos;s remitted to us from the federal government as part of their overall collection of income taxes .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
any further comments , questions ?
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
maybe to use an example of the provinces , the rest of the provinces pay provincial taxes .
for example , in the province of ontario , they pay 7 % pst .
and my question is , is there going to be another level of tax imposed on the nunavut territory ?
chairperson :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
right now , mr. chairperson , right now , no , there hasn &apos;t been any additional taxes put in place for the nunavut territory .
the nunavut territory has no provincial sales tax .
the nunavut territory has no sales tax .
and , it &apos;s the same income tax rate for personal income tax that we &apos;ve taken over , to date .
thank you .
chairperson :
okay .
good .
mr. nutarak , was that you ?
maybe they can &apos;t hear me .
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
in reference to mr. nutaraks &apos; question , what he was trying to ask the minister was , is there going to be a nunavut services tax sometime in the future ?
is there going to be an established nunavut services tax sometime in the future ?
chairperson :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
mr. chairperson , it &apos;s too early to say one way or another .
we &apos;ll see what the sense is to develop the next budget .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
very good now .
questions or comments if there &apos;s nothing further .
quite a lot of hands came up .
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
you mentioned 500 thousand hundred dollars for p3 initiative ;
can the minister inform us what projects this will include ?
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson :
mr. minister .
hon. kelvin ng :
mr. chairperson , this doesn &apos;t go into any specific project per se .
it &apos;s for the development of the government of nunavut &apos;s policies and procedures surrounding how we would implement and go through the public / private partnership arrangements .
thank you .
chairperson :
i still have two names on the list and , after these two have spoken , we &apos;ll take a break .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairperson .
just going back to that general question , you indicated earlier that the formula financing agreement allows for the decentralized model .
in your budget address , you indicated that this formula financing grant is intended to allow the delivery of the same level of services in nunavut as was previously offered by the gnwt .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
mr. chairperson that is bit of a subjective question .
thank you .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i &apos;m not an accountant , but explain how something that was incurred in one year is offset against something coming in from another area .
i &apos;m just wondering if you could clarify that for me because it &apos;s not totally clear .
thank you mr. chairperson .
hon. kelvin ng :
i guess , the way i would understand it , if i &apos;m wrong the accountants sitting here could correct me .
so , the 50 less the 4 , we would have 46 million dollars opening balance in respect to assets on april 1st , 1999 .
that &apos;s basically my understanding of it .
thank you .
chairperson :
your last question mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairperson .
mr. chairperson , it &apos;s my understanding that the audit of the oic operations may be concluded by the end of june .
around that timetable .
for the assets and liabilities with the gnwt is october of 1999 , i believe , where that is supposed to be concluded .
thank you .
chairperson :
we &apos;ll get back to you later on .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. chairperson .
my question to the finance minister is , the allocation of capital dollars is based on standards , criteria , health , safety , and other factors .
the standards and criteria that we brought over from gnwt are old and outdated .
it &apos;s probably 10-15 years old .
is your department looking at setting standards and criteria , and health and safety factors that reflect the true needs of the people of nunavut ?
chairperson :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
mr. chairperson , we haven &apos;t undertaken that exercise as yet .
the plan would be to undertake that but the problem we have of course is the timing .
no , i &apos;ve given the priorities of trying to get things up and running as it stands now .
so , there &apos;s a lot of issues that we have trying to get operational right now , that has been the priority of all of the departments .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. chairperson .
this will be my final question to that answer .
thank you .
chairperson :
minister ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairperson .
normally , the department of public works , our public works , telecommunications and technical services have a big component of the development of standards and criteria in respect to facilities .
i don &apos;t know what kind of timetable they would have .
probably , when the minister comes , you can ask on that .
chairperson :
perhaps we &apos;ll take 10 minutes short break .
thank you .
&gt; &gt; committee recesses
chairperson :
i apologize .
we &apos;ll just continue on with the department . and i will just continue on with the names on the list that i have .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
there &apos;s a feedback somewhere .
thank you mr. chairperson .
in regards to , this is a supplementary to mr. tootoo &apos;s comments , although mr. ng had responded by saying that there will be negotiations on the division of the liabilities and assets .
but , when you state that the regular members have no authority or input according to the way you responded , will we have input or will we be involved or will we participate ?
will we participate during the process of dividing the assets and liabilities ?
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson :
thank you .
minister ng , you may respond now .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairperson .
mr. chairperson , there &apos;s no plans for mla &apos;s or for ministers for that matter to participate .
this is strictly an officials function because the formula and all the agreements were agreed upon prior to march 31st .
they &apos;re signed off by the government of the nwt , and the office of the interim commissioner in respect to percentages and what counts and doesn &apos;t count .
it &apos;s all laid out in the division of assets and liabilities agreement that was agreed upon by the legal entities that had the authority to enter into discussions and make the final agreement .
so we &apos;re following through in implementing what ever that agreement was just to make sure that there &apos;s nothing that falls between the cracks .
thank you .
chairperson :
member , mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
prior to the establishment of the nunavut government , all these processes were prepared before the election of the legislative assembly .
i feel that the members of the legislature should be involved .
once we have been elected , we should be involved in the process , and we should also be involved in the agreements that have been signed off .
since after being elected , can &apos;t we make changes as members of the legislative assembly , as elected people ?
we also state that , in the programs , we would like to see programs according to the needs of nunavut residents .
we should be involved , and we should deal with this issue again .
because , during my campaign , that &apos;s what i spoke about .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson :
minister ng , would you like to respond ?
hon. kelvin ng :
mr. chairperson , i guess the way i would explain it is , it &apos;s not a political negotiation , it &apos;s not a political exercise .
it &apos;s strictly an accounting of officials work is what it comes out to because there &apos;s an agreed upon criteria to divide the assets and liabilities .
so that &apos;s the only way i can explain it for the member .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
i &apos;m finished .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
mr. chairperson , there &apos;s been some fairly detailed news coverage on the 20 million dollars that &apos;s going to be put in housing for nunavut .
correct me mr. minister if i &apos;m mistaken , i think it just recently covered in the national news and so on .
can the minister tell us exactly how that money is going to be distributed , what type of housing ?
thank you .
chairperson :
minister ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
i don &apos;t have that detail before me .
in respect to the budget , i present the broader government programs , highlight some of those programs to the assembly and deliver the budget speech , and the details .
that &apos;s why we have the cabinet , and the ministers that are responsible for their portfolios to provide more of the details of what their programming is mr. chairperson .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i understand what you &apos;re saying mr. minister , and that &apos;s fine if we &apos;re talking about one hundred thousand dollars .
we &apos;re talking about 20 million dollars .
let &apos;s say we have $ 20,000,000.00 dollars for housing , is it for social housing ?
is it home ownership ?
you must have some preliminary concepts you are going to pass out to the members here .
thank you .
chairperson :
minister ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
mr. chairperson , we are dealing with the finance and administration department budget today , and broader government responsibilities and initiatives that will fall under the department of finance and administration .
thank you .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i &apos;ll accept then , mr. chairperson , if the minister doesn &apos;t know what exactly the 20 million dollars is for .
i think it is pretty large sum of money that we &apos;re talking about .
i thought that information would be readily available .
no more questions thank you .
chairperson :
minister ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
mr. chairperson , i had indicated , i &apos;m not the minister of cght .
i know that the 20 million dollars is for delivering up social housing programs .
home ownership is a whole blend of a housing component .
it &apos;s pretty broad when you talk about housing , and the minister has that detail .
i don &apos;t have that detail here .
if i had it , i &apos;d provide it to the member .
thank you .
chairperson :
your last question mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i &apos;ve indicated that i accepted that the minister did not know what the money was for , and that &apos;s fine .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
although you responded to this question i would like to comment on it further that we will go into a deficit a little bit over 5 million dollars .
would the minister be able to look for new dollars from the federal government to be utilized for this deficit because it seems that this deficit is not the responsibility of the nunavut government .
this doesn &apos;t look too good for the new nunavut government , would the minister be able to look for new funding or new dollars to be utilized for the deficit .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
yes , mr. chairperson the intent is that we would pursue with our federal counterparts at every opportunity some of what we felt were their obligations instead of ours .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
do you want to make a supplementary comment .
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
mr. chairperson , my name is irqittuq , not erkidjuk .
you and the premier , i would be able to give you some advice so you would be able to take it along to the federal government .
we have been helping those albanians while there are many people sleeping on the street in canada and in nunavut we are in a deficit .
so i can support you out if you need more tools or bullets if you want to go down to ottawa .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
mr. chairperson i appreciate the members &apos; comments .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairperson .
earlier i asked about how your department would ensure the other departments wouldn &apos;t go over budget and you indicated that you are just going to monitor them .
are there any more detailed plans as far as what the exact processes will be in place , other than that we are just going to keep an eye on them ?
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
member for iqaluktutsiaq mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
all ministers also sit on the financial management board where all expenditures of the government are co-ordinated .
thank you .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairperson .
somehow i knew you were going to say that .
is there a process in place if some one comes back partway through for additional resources for the department ?
what &apos;s the process involved there and will those resources have to be cut somewhere else to make up for that ?
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo that is your last question .
mr. tootoo :
is there a set criteria or something that is used in that , or is that something that is brought up on an as discovered , or as needed basis .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. ng do you want to respond to that ?
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairperson .
mr. chairperson there are pretty stringent financial management board guidelines that outline the expenditures that departments have and in what circumstances they can come for supplementary appropriations .
so those guidelines are there and ultimately , its &apos; the financial management board that approves or disapproves , after justification , based on those guidelines that are put forward .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i have no further names on the list of members of the legislative assembly .
are there any further comments from the floor ?
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
my last question is in regards to lease costs that are being incurred by the nunavut government .
i understand , for example , that the legislative assembly building is now being , those lease costs are being incurred by the government of nunavut .
i am just wondering if the minister has an answer to that ?
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. ng if you wish to respond ?
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairperson .
mr. chairperson , that question is more appropriate to be answered by the minister of public works , telecommunications &amp; technical services , who has responsibility for buildings , standards and criteria .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
ms. thompson , if you could respond to the question ?
i am sorry , mr. tootoo , is that all ?
comments , questions , members comments ?
now with respect to the budget assumptions and main estimates we are going to go to page 34 , 3-4 , under directorate .
so if you could open page 34 in your government of nunavut main estimates binder . in 3-4 , the directorate , are there any questions or comments in respect to the directorate ?
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i stated earlier at the top , in 6 - 08 , in respect to the inuktitut translation , i understand that this is 608 .
i would like the members to have better understanding , because as an inuk i understand this to mean 608 dollars and it is kind of misleading .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
we will reach that shortly , but we are dealing with the directorate .
if there are any other comments in respect to the directorate , we are still in 3-4 , item on the directorate and the total expenditure for operations and maintenance is 825 thousand dollars .
minister ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
historically it has been done in thousands of dollars , thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i would now pose the question as to whether the 825 thousand is approved .
agreed .
capital items .
there is no total capital for the directorate .
there is nothing in respect to the capital items , the total expenditures for the directorate budget stands at 825 thousands dollars .
a member :
agreed .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
agreed .
open the next page to 3-5 , fiscal policy and expenditure management .
the operations and maintenance , in total is 3 million , 30 thousand dollars .
in respect to the capital , there is nothing in the total capital budget items and therefore the total expenditures for fiscal policy and expenditure management is 3 million and 30 thousand dollars .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i am just wondering if the minister in going through each of these could just provide us with the total number of py &apos;s in each division and a total number for the department .
if that would be possible ?
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
mr. chairperson , in this particular branch , 8.1 .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
does that answer your question mr. tootoo ?
mr. tootoo :
just asking if he could do that for each division so we can get a total for the whole department ?
thank you mr. chairperson .
hon. kelvin ng :
oh , you want it for the whole department ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
we are still on page 3-6 , financial services .
the operations and maintenance in total is 1 million 213 thousand dollars .
agreed .
capital items , there are no capital items for financial services , so therefore the total expenditures are 1 million 213 thousand dollars .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairperson .
again , i would just like to know the total number of py &apos;s that are involved .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng : 11.2 in financial services .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairperson .
in financial services this is a division that looks after all of the other departments .
as the minister indicated earlier they are going to be providing all of the financial services for all of the other departments .
i am just wondering if that includes taking that into consideration , or did that take into consideration each department having their own finance division ?
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
i will ask mr. vardy to respond to this one .
mr. vardy :
okay , the financial services division will provide support to the financial services staff in all departments , but there will be capacity built up in each department .
it is more a support and co-ordinating role in the first probably four years in the new government .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i would imagine that this number over time would go down as those responsibilities are devolved to the departments ?
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
yes .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
we are still on page 3-6 , the total expenditures is 1 million , 213 thousand dollars .
in respect to informatics , in 3-7 the total operations and maintenance altogether is 4 million , 506 thousand dollars .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairperson .
mr. chairman , i wonder if the minister could just speak briefly as to what their actual plan is for this informatics technology program , i guess .
how do they ensure that all of the communities have access to this and it is as user friendly as possible ?
thank you .
hon. kelvin ng :
i &apos;ll ask mr. vardy once again on this one mr. chairperson .
thank you .
mr. vardy :
the informatics program of the government of nunavut , could be a very massive expenditure .
it is one of the main reasons why the oic went over their budget is because of underestimates of the cost of setting up the technology in a decentralized manner throughout the territory .
what we have in finance is the systems development side and in public works , they are responsible for the operations and the technical side of the system .
in the systems development side we have a budget of around 4 million dollars for next year .
with regard to the actual set up of the network in each location , it is probably a better question to direct to the department of public works .
what we have there now , the big systems are the payroll system , human resource management system , the peoplesoft .
its &apos; one that is critically important but is an area that if its &apos; not tightly managed , you could easily chew up a big portion of the budget of the territory .
i think it is a goal that all governments have of having those systems .
in the north as well , we have to look at the trade off between it and other communication modes , including air travel .
it &apos;s a high priority area to get a handle on .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i am sure that it is a major task and fairly expensive .
mr. vardy :
mr. chairperson .
definitely in english and inuktitut .
i don &apos;t know the extent that we will have the programming done in french .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i wanted to speak shortly and remind you to please recognize the chairperson before you speak and please wait patiently while the chairperson recognizes you .
we have to stick to procedure .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
just on the py &apos;s .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
is this going to create a big problem for the government , the y2k bug ?
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i believe you are speaking to computers , but could you speak to the y2k and what effect it may have on the government .
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
are you going to respond to mr. iqaqrialus &apos; question ?
hon. kelvin ng :
i was trying to say in response to his question that we think all of the systems we have are y2k compliant so there won &apos;t be any problems .
a lot of the stuff was developed recently after identification of the potential y2k problem .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
let &apos;s proceed , the total expenditures is 4 million , 506 thousand dollars .
agreed .
there &apos;s nothing in capital items , so therefore the total expenditures for informatics is 4 million , 506 thousand dollars .
agreed .
some members :
agreed .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
okay .
let &apos;s proceed to the next page , 3-8 , comptrollership . the operations and maintenance budget is 17 million , 974 thousand dollars .
there are no capital expenditures therefore the total expenditures for comptrollership are 17 million , 974 thousand dollars .
agreed .
the next page 3-9 , details of grants &amp; contributions .
i wish to ask a question to the members .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
in respect to this issue , i don &apos;t quite understand the meaning of this in relation to the itemized budget .
perhaps if you could clarify the items in details of grants &amp; contributions .
hon. kelvin ng :
go ahead mr. vardy .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. vardy , you may proceed .
mr. vardy :
mr. chairperson , the grants &amp; contributions occur in different divisions throughout our department .
in government accounting we have insurance premiums of 1.5 million dollars .
sorry , in response to that particular question , 3.8 million is for power subsidies .
it is just a continuation of the existing subsidies that the government of the nwt had in place .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu , supplementary .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
in respect to the 3.8 million dollars and how much expenditure , we may be looking forward to the power plant which is supposed to be built in clyde river .
perhaps there will be different rates for the different regions in nunavut for power .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairperson .
this is again , based on maintaining stability in programs .
it is based on the yellowknife market rate for power consumption and i believe it is subsidized for private homeowners up to 700 kilowatt hours per month based on that yellowknife rate .
it is an ongoing program and it is what was spent on the nunavut side last year and it is a continuation of that subsidy .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
is this geared only towards homeowners ?
is not everyone eligible for this subsidy .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
it is my understanding that all home operators have accessibility to the subsidy program , so you can be renting a unit and still get a subsidy on your power consumption on that unit .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
did that answer your question , mr. iqaqrialu ?
mr. iqaqrialu supplementary .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
while we are on this issue in relation to the budget items , perhaps when mr. picco is here i can pose further questions , so i will just let this go .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
report on the budget for detailed grants &amp; contributions .
i would like everyone to know that they will not proceed because at this time they are for information purposes only .
we are at 3-9 the details for grants &amp; contributions .
this is just an information item to help us understand why they have budgeted what they have .
at this point in time i would like to ask if these are agreed to .
are you agreed ?
agreed .
on the next page 2 - 10 , distribution of budget .
again for your information .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
mr. chairperson , we are on 3-10 .
okay .
on that , i would like to ask the minister if he would explain this , taking a look at the total operations &amp; maintenance for the three regions .
the baffin has 734 thousand , keewatin is 1 million , 103 thousand , and the kitikmeot is 977 thousand .
given that the baffin is twice as large as the other two regions , i would just like to inquire as to why the difference in the dollar amounts .
if he could explain that ?
thank you mr. chairperson
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairperson .
mr. chairperson it is mainly because the baffin region is being serviced from the headquarters division right now .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
we have about twice the population in the baffin area , and baffin has 1 / 2 the budget .
why is that .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
we can discuss that at a later time .
mr. arvaluk did you have a comment ?
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
mr. chairperson it is the same question that was asked by the previous member .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
distribution of budget .
okay , then we will refer back to 3-3 .
details of expenditures .
total operations &amp; maintenance 27 million , 548 thousand .
total capital and total expenditures , zero balance for total capital , and total expenditures 27 million , 548 thousand .
i would like to ask if you approve the finance &amp; administration .
agreed .
thank you minister of finance and also your officials .
thank you .
&gt; &gt; applause
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
at this time i would like to ask what the committees &apos; wish is .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
mr. chairperson , i would like to report progress .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :

mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
i move that we report progress at 5.55 .

congratulations to students of inuglak school
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
today i rise to make a statement and i would like to take this opportunity to highlight the recent accomplishment of some of our students and teachers for which i &apos;m especially proud .
this competition is open to any school , which holds a scholastic book fair and it &apos;s held right across canada .
it is important to know that the winning entrants are professionally published and sold all across canada at scholastic book fairs .
the winning school also receives a 1 thousand-dollar cash prize .
( interpretation ends )
i would like to further highlight the extent of this accomplishment .
that inuglak school submission was completed by students , whose first language is inuktitut .
i &apos;m happy to report that inuglak school won first place out of one hundred eighty entries from across canada .
this is an ideal project for the students of inuglak to work together in order to create culturally relevant material that is now a source of pride .
i would especially like to note the contributions of the following teachers .
project advisors , michael montcombroux , ken jacobi , sue callard .
i &apos;m sure the members would like to congratulate these students at this time .

mr. tootoo
members &apos; statement 36 - 1 ( 2 ) : condition of iqaluit roads
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
iqaluit has the honourable distinction of being canada &apos;s newest and smallest territorial capital .
however , it also has the dubious distinction of being perhaps the community with the largest pot holes in the entire country .
as our capital , iqaluit is for many visitors , the first and last sight of nunavut .
a capital should reflect the beauty , strength , and character of it &apos;s jurisdiction .
mr. speaker , iqaluit does all of this and more .
just yesterday while driving behind our new minister of health and social services i was startled to note that the ministers &apos; van suddenly took a dip and disappeared from view .
several tense seconds passed , before he emerged from one of iqaluits &apos; infamous pot holes .
i am certain that all honourable members will join me in expressing relief at his narrow escape .
mr. speaker i fully support council and mayor kilabuk in their efforts to address this issue .
i will do what i can to help ensure that the council receives adequate resources to fix our roads and hopefully to pave them .
mr. speaker our community is a capital for all of nunavut and has much more to offer to visitors and residents alike , than a bone shaking drive .
i urge us to get to work on this .
thank you mr. speaker .

i would like to pay tribute at this time to all our families and to my wife caroline and my children , i express my special appreciation .
mr. speaker we &apos;re all here because we want to make life better for our constituents and all the people of nunavut .
i would like to thank my colleagues for having elected me to cabinet and for giving me this unique opportunity to contribute to improving nunavut .
also i thank the premier for the portfolios i hold . the areas i have responsibility for , community government , housing and transportation and justice are all areas close to the people .
i &apos;m very pleased to have the chance to work for improvements in these areas , which are very important to the people of rankin inlet north and all the communities .
i look forward to working with all my colleagues around this table . i respect your commitment to your communities and i appreciate your support .

return 2 - 1 ( 2 ) :
question 12 - 1 ( 2 ) hall beach school addition
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i have a return to an oral question asked by the mla for amittuq on may 13 , 1999 regarding an addition to be built onto the school in hall beach .
mr. speaker , decisions surrounding capital projects and which ones were to proceed this year were based on three criteria .
a capital project would proceed if :
construction work on the building had already begun ; there was already a binding commitment to proceed ;
orthere was a critical safety issue which required the work to be done .
mr. speaker the proposed work on the hall beach school , after being reviewed by the capital projects review committee was deemed not to meet this year &apos;s criteria .

urgent funding requirements for hamlet of clyde river
mr. iqaqrialu : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i would like to pose this question to the minister of community government .
in our community of clyde river , the hamlet of clyde river has been awaiting for transfer of $ 58 thousand and $ 20 thousand for ( inaudible comment ) identified .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. anawak , minister of maca . minister of housing &amp; transportation .
hon. jack anawak :
minister of community government , housing &amp; transportation and i understand this issue , i believe that it &apos;s a deficit , or a budget deficit in clyde river .
i knew there was a problem even before i became a minister and while it was still under the purview of the g.n.w.t. government .
as i became a minister , i spoke with my deputy minister , well unfortunately i &apos;ve not had the opportunity to talk with him about this .
i know he &apos;s dealing with the issue , perhaps i can tell him that it is being taken care of , however i will inquire as to what the status is .
i &apos;m sorry , if he raises another question , i am not trying to close it , if he wants to add a supplementary .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu , supplementary .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
for a while now , this has caused problems in our community , specifically to the hamlet in respect of the operational funds .
it &apos;s been ongoing for a while now , and perhaps if you can direct your officials to deal directly with the hamlet , that would please me tremendously if you could do that .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. anawak , minister of community government , housing , &amp; transportation .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
yes , they are able to deal with this and they will work with the hamlet to resolve these issues .
thank you , mr. speaker .

oral questions .
mr. o &apos;brien ?
question 39 - 1 ( 2 ) :
decentralization
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question &apos;s for the acting premier .
mr. speaker , all the members in the room realize and know how important decentralization is to the smaller , less fortunate communities .
yesterday , i posed a question to the minister of finance in reference to if the funding was incorporated into the budget to ensure that the decentralized model would take place .
the minister indicated that the funding was incorporated into the budget , and that was good news .
unfortunately we also heard that , the premier indicated that they have commissioned a study to re-evaluate the decentralization process .
i &apos;d like to ask the acting premier as to who is doing the study and why the study is being done .
thank you .
speaker :
two questions , mr. ng , minister of finance .
thank you , acting premier .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , as it stands now , it isn &apos;t , per se , a study from the perspective of what people would perceive as a study .
thank you .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you , mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. ng , minister of finance .
hon. kelvin ng :
again that &apos;s another factor that has to be taken into consideration .
so it &apos;s a matter of setting some priorities and having a rational schedule and timing and a plan for how we &apos;re going to implement it .
that &apos;s where the difficulties are right now in respect to the government planning and procedures in establishing the decentralized model .
thank you .
speaker :
qujannami , mr. ng .
mr. o &apos;brien , supplementary .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you , mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. acting premier .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , this government has said that we &apos;re committed to the principles of the decentralized model as they were laid out , and it is a matter of the logistics .
if i can use another example that has been brought to our attention , the community of gjoa haven and having liquor warehousing in that community , whether or not that makes sense .
another matter for example that has to be considered is the community of kugluktuk and legal registries when all the support services for filing in the legal system are based here in iqaluit .
those are the broader implementation issues that we &apos;re trying to come to grips with .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you , mr. ng .
second supplementary , mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
when do we think that we can give the communities a firm commitment ?
i know it &apos;s fine when we say that we &apos;re committed to it , but i guess the issue is when ?
thank you .
speaker :
thank you , mr. o &apos;brien .
that was .. sorry , that was your final supplementary .
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i believe the premier indicated that there would be cabinet discussions session on that , i believe he mentioned the date to june 29th or the 30th .
at the same time i believe that he also committed that it would be a matter of discussion in the strategic planning sessions planned for baker lake .
thank you .

hon. james arvaluk :
speaker :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the minister indicated that they are going to be hiring a co-ordinator to co-ordinate those efforts , i would assume then that they do have a plan in place ?
if he could just affirm that ? thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker : mr. arvaluk , minister of education .
hon. james arvaluk :
mr. speaker , can the member repeat the question please ?
speaker :
mr. tootoo ?
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the minister indicated that they would be hiring a co-ordinator to co-ordinate the implementation plan ?
i would take that as indicating that the department has an implementation plan that they will be implementing ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you , mr. tootoo .
mr. arvaluk , minister of education .
hon. james arvaluk :
when the recommendation to have no boards was taken later , then we didn &apos;t really have time , to date , to put all the implementation plans together before the members sat .
as soon as the cabinet makes a decision , then i would be happy to report .
speaker :
thank you , mr. arvaluk .
third question , mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i look forward to getting the information .
thank you .
speaker :

question 41 - 1 ( 2 ) :
decentralized positions for hall beach
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i &apos;ve a question to the minister of finance regarding the jobs .
i believe there are seventy-two and a half py &apos;s in my constituency .
my question is are we going to get those seventy-two and a half py &apos;s in hall beach ?
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. irqittuq .
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. ng ?
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , obviously , if i could have hired all the people and had them in place by april 1 , then that &apos;s the ideal situation .
having said that , we all recognize that it wasn &apos;t possible to do that .
we are trying to plan that out in as quickly a time fashions as possible so we can bring some certainty and closure to the issue .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
third question mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i understood your response .
with the finances allocated for the py &apos;s , is there money available to move these people out to the communities under the decentralization plan ?
is there money already allocated in the budget to move those people out to the communities ?

oral questions , mr. mclean .
question 42 - 1 ( 2 ) :
regular members input to decentralization review
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question is to the acting premier regarding decentralization and his comments , saying that the departments of executive , intergovernmental affairs , and cabinet are working on rearranging the model .
speaker :
two questions .
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , first of all , we are not planning on dumping anything on anybody in baker lake .
i think what we are doing now is trying to take an assessment on what is out there and what is available and trying to outline some of the problems .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
third question , mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
minister of finance mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , most definitely , there is no plan to be rearranging anything at this stage , just assessing what is out there and realistically what can be done right now .
that is the main basis of what we are trying to assess .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
oral questions , mr. nutarak .
question 43 - 1 ( 2 ) :
infrastructure and decentralization in pond inlet
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question is to mr. anawak , minister of community government , housing &amp; transportation .
regarding staff housing , the infrastructure that is being built in anticipation of decentralization in pond inlet is slated to be built this year .
i wonder if that is going to go ahead ?
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
minister of community government , housing &amp; transportation .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
i am sorry , would you ask him to repeat his question please ?
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. nutarak , would you rephrase your question please ?
thank you .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
there is supposed to be infrastructure built this summer in pond inlet but there may be a delay because of the land availability there , or quality of it .
so my question is , are the plans going ahead to build the infrastructure or are those going to be delayed .
there may be some problems that will not allow the construction to go ahead because the land fill site has not been restored .
i don &apos;t know what the plans are to restore the land that is near where the infrastructure is happening this summer .
i want a clarification of what the plans are .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. anawak , that was a question directed to you .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker as the acting premier i should take that because the question has to do with the broader financing , and quite frankly , with nunavut construction company .
given the agreement that they have established with diand for constructing the office space and the housing for turnover to the nunavut government as it stands now that agreement is still in place .
the nunavut construction company with the federal government is developing that same infrastructure .
we have no participation in that except for when it is finalized we assume responsibility for those lease payments .
but if the honourable member has some concerns about the timing on that , we will certainly find out what is going on with the planned infrastructure in his community .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
maybe i should be directing this to the minister of public works .
i wonder if the old land fill site is going to be restored and if it is going to be restored this coming summer .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
( interpretation ends ) .
i will ask ms. thompson to answer , because that was where mr. nutarak directed it .
ms. thompson , minister of public works , telecommunications &amp; technical services .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i know that there have been some funds set aside for the land fill site in pond inlet .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. thompson .
oral questions .
mr. alakannuark .
question 44 - 1 ( 2 ) :
rent scale and public housing
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i will direct this question to the minister of housing .
my question is that the public housing units and those people who rent them , the price of rent keeps going higher .
i wonder if the rent scale is going to be reconsidered in the near future ?
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
the lowest rent is 32 dollars and , once a person becomes employed , their rent goes way higher than that .
so , i &apos;m not sure if this is the question that he &apos;s asking about , but that &apos;s one of the issues we &apos;ll be addressing during our meetings about rent scales .
we have heard in the past that , once a person becomes a wage earner , their rents go way up and , i think , they start paying 30 % of their wages .
so , we &apos;ll be looking at this in the near future .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
second question , mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark :
thank you mr. speaker .
this is a supplementary question to the same minister of housing .
the rental units in the communities are becoming scarce and , we have a population growth that is growing who are demanding their own housing .
so , the occupancy rate per unit is very high and there &apos;s been overcrowding , and that causes problems .
so , now , is it being considered that there be more public housing built in communities ?
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
community government , housing &amp; transportation minister , anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
we would like to see the communities be self-sufficient .
that &apos;s what they want to do in their hamlet .
we would like to see more communities taking the initiative to provide homeownership or make more it more accessible to be a homeowner in the communities .
that &apos;s what the residents of taloyoak are doing right now and we would like to see more of that in the communities .
i do understand , however , what his question is but i &apos;m not sure if we will be obtaining more funds for us to address this issue .
our colleagues in ottawa are well aware of this problem , too .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
mr. iqaqrialu .
question 45 - 1 ( 2 ) :
nursing shortage
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
this is directed to the minister of health and social services .
in some communities , especially in the smaller communities , they have one nurse in their health centres that work 24 hours a day .
they are only human , and they should be taking rest breaks .
how are these nurses going to be replaced so that they can take their break in communities ?
do you have a program whereby these people can be relieved from time to time ?
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. minister .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker , and thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
it was a good question .
the concern right now , mr. speaker , is not unique just to nunavut .
indeed , it seems to be a national problem , and that is the availability of nurses and professional nursing staff .
what we want to try and do , from the departments point of view , is to put in place a recruitment and retention program , which we &apos;re working on right now .
so that we &apos;ll have a pool of nurses that will be available at the community level .
for example , in the communities where we have two nurses that are working 12 hour shifts , that is not acceptable .
we realize that .
i realize that .
the members of the house realize that .
of course , we don &apos;t have that right now available to us .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) : thank you mr. speaker .
i think this is a major concern and i think this has become a crisis .
i know that if you decide to address it quickly and treat it as a first priority , i think that you can do something about that .
i would like to see you deal with this , as soon as possible .
especially in the area of nursing shortages , so that people can take comfort that if they should get ill , they will be taken care of .
speaker :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker . yes , mr. speaker , indeed , my department and the government take the issue of shortage of nurses very serious .
as i said before , it &apos;s not just unique to nunavut .
indeed , we just heard a couple of weeks ago that mr. harris of ontario was putting about 250 million dollars back into the health care system and hiring 10,000 nurses .
we have to look at , on the recruitment and retention side , what we need to put in place to maintain and retain the nurses that we have working for us .
that &apos;s not providing the continuity we want to see in our communities .
so , i agree with the member .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i &apos;m talking about the area of nunavut .
specifically , i &apos;m not concerned about the rest of canada or southern canada .
rather , i &apos;m talking about nunavut specific issues .
are you also involved in recruiting nurses for areas other than nunavut ?
i &apos;m concerned about filling the positions in nunavut .
speaker :
thank you iqaqrialu .
minister of health mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
i &apos;ve known mr. iqaqrialu for a long time , and i know that he &apos;s asking that question very seriously .
nurses just don &apos;t come out of the ground .
they have to be trained . there &apos;s x-number of nurses available , and we &apos;re competing against other jurisdictions .
when we &apos;re competing against other jurisdictions , to get nurses to come to the north , we have to be able to offer them a good benefits package .
we want to offer them good working conditions .
indeed , mr. speaker , those are all the things that we &apos;re looking at in the retention and recruitment program .
that &apos;s what i meant by saying that we &apos;re trying to recruit nationally .
we have to compete against those other jurisdictions .
and it &apos;s not easy .
one of the reasons why we &apos;re looking at health boards , and elimination of health boards , is to be able to take a nunavut perspective .
so , we should be hiring nurses for nunavut , not for specific regions of our home .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
last and final question . mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
my final question .
if we &apos;re just going to be recruiting from outside of nunavut , i don &apos;t think that that is acceptable .
but , for the nunavut residents , i think that we can also train health care professionals for nunavut specific jobs .
i think by providing educational opportunities and training opportunities in nunavut that would stop a lot of recruiting that &apos;s happening right now in southern canada .
nunavut nurses can learn to be nurses in nunavut .
i think that would solve a lot of our problems .
perhaps education programs , or program funds should be identified by your department so we don &apos;t have to keep looking outside of nunavut to hire these people .
speaker :
minister of health , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
mr. speaker . i agree with the member .
earlier today , i made a statement where we had nine x-ray technologist graduates here at nunavut arctic college for the first time in nunavut .
i think we should be very pleased and happy about that .
we have already seen the successful completion of several of our residents trained as community health representatives , chr &apos;s .
mr. speaker , we &apos;ve had an entrance program two years running now for the nursing program .
at the end of that program over the next several months and years , we &apos;ll have trained nurses here in nunavut .
that &apos;s what i was talking about when i said , we have to train people here in nunavut .
that &apos;s how we will be able to , hopefully , supply a market for local talent .
that &apos;s the way the department is looking at it , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to bring forth .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
mr. akesuk . oral questions .
question 46 - 1 ( 2 ) :
arctic college nursing training program
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
maybe this is directed to the minister of education .
at one time , at the arctic college , there was a program that was getting underway at to train nurses .
i wonder if the program is going to be reinstated and for that to be able to go ahead in this coming semester .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. akesuk .
minister of education james arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
this is being considered at this time because the health care students were unable to continue on with their courses .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
mr. kattuk .
question 47 - 1 ( 2 ) :
rehabilitation programs for inmates
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question is directed to the minister of justice , mr. anawak .
at the baffin correctional centre , here in iqaluit , i think that the department of justice refers to it as a warehouse , where you put away people .
the people who are inmates of that facility are not provided with any rehabilitative programs .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kattuk .
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
yes , thank you .
we don &apos;t want to put our people away to warehouses , especially our people .
i have had meetings with the officials in the department of justice , specifically in the area of correctional facilities , including the one in iqaluit , and the ycc in yellowknife .
that &apos;s exactly what we want to do .
we want to establish facilities that are more directed to the lifestyles of the geographical area that they come from .
for example , we &apos;re looking at young people who may be able to take programs where they can go on an out on the land training program .
we are looking at these current programs in preparation to return them to local communities .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you minister jack anawak .

consulting contract , department of health
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question is to the minister responsible for health , mr. picco .
thank you .
speaker :
two questions for mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
what we spoke about in the committee , and what we said subsequently was that , under the department of health , we want to put an organizational plan in place .
the contract for that work to be developed over the next several weeks will be in conjunction with the department of education .
the terms of reference of the contract , once put in place , i could commit to table that in the house if that &apos;s what the member &apos;s requesting .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
second question , mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i was under the impression that the contract was actually let , and that the person was in place .
just for clarification purposes , is the minister saying that is not the case ?
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister of health , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i &apos;m not aware if an actual contract has been let or if an individual is actually in place working .

report 3 - 1 ( 2 ) :
ajauqtiit , review of draft business plans and preliminary budget information 1999 / 2000 main estimates
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker i would like to review the introduction and general recommendations from the standing committee of ajauqtiit .
mr. speaker , members of ajauqtiit reviewed the draft business plan and preliminary budget information for the legislative assembly on tuesday , april 27th , 1999 .
a total budget allocation for operations of the legislative assembly of nunavut is 9 million , 748 thousand .
in general recommendations , as with other standing committees , members experienced some frustration in reviewing financial print outs that were initially provided only in english .
members thank the office of the legislative assembly for preparing an inuktitut , more user friendly format and providing it to the members after the meeting .
however , in light of difficulties effecting all committees , members passed the following motion :
that all materials or correspondence provided by the government of nunavut departments or ministers to the members of the legislative assembly should be done in both english and inuktitut .
that sufficient resources be allocated for translation services to ensure that this happens on a timely basis .
mr. speaker , that concludes my introductory comments .
i move , seconded by the member from hudson bay , that the report be referred to committee of the whole for consideration in concurrence with the 1999 / 2000 main estimates .
i further seek unanimous consent to waive rule 91-4 to move the report into committee of the whole for today .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo is seeking unanimous consent to waive rule 91 ( 4 ) , that the committee report be tabled at the committee of the whole .
are there any nays ?
since there are no nays , mr. tootoo you have unanimous consent .
thank you .
item 12 . reports of the standing and special committees .
mr. nutarak .
report 4 - 1 ( 2 ) :
culture , education &amp; health , review of draft business plans and preliminary information on the 1999 / 2000 main estimates
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i will be reading the report on the review of draft business plans of the standing committee on culture , education and health .
it has seven pages .
standing committee on culture , education and health .
review departmental performance , and consider any other matter referred by the house .
the standing committee has oversight responsibility for the following : the department of health and social services , department of education , department of culture , language , elders and youth .
introduction.at the point of the standing committees &apos; review in april of 1999 , the government of nunavut was only three weeks old .
nevertheless , in spite of it &apos;s youth , the government has had to make plans and move forward quickly with the budget for the new fiscal year .
much of this preparatory work was done by departments prior to march 31 / 99 , under the leadership of the office of the interim commissioner .
presentations were made by the ministers and their departmental officials to the standing committee which included draft business plans mostly developed prior to february 5th . 1999 .
draft capital plans , mostly commitments by gnwt prior to march 31 , 1999 and one-page budgets or main estimate summaries .
members also had the opportunity to ask questions to obtain further details and some departments provided additional information following the hearings .
as this is the first time that the standing committees have performed this review function , members have some questions and recommendations about the process for all three departments .
general recommendations to all departments : the need for detailed and realistic plans and long term goals .
the standing committee is concerned with setting up expectations that may not be met due to limitations in our financial or human resources .
at the same time the standing committee appreciated the efforts of the departments which outlined longer term strategic goals and objectives , even up to twenty years .
footprints.it is unclear from the presentations to the standing committee what directions the departments have received regarding the recommendations that are in the footprints documents prepared by the nunavut implementation commission .
there appears to be some inconsistency as the departments are fulfilling some footprints recommendations but not fulfilling others .
is there a list of principles or criteria by which departments are making decisions ?
recommendation :
that the government of nunavut generally implement the recommendations of footprints unless there are good reasons for pursuing an alternate course of action , and these reasons are publicly outlined .
decentralization :
footprints recommended a decentralized government .
the office of the interim commissioner reviewed these recommendations and in october 1998 made a public commitment for a number of decentralized positions under different departments to go to specific communities .
it is unclear from the presentations to the standing committees as to what the plans are for these decentralized positions .
which communities will have which positions and what is the expected time frame for these positions to be established ?
furthermore , how will the services that have been contracted back to the gnwt be integrated into the decentralization plan ?
recommendation .
that the government of nunavut departments provide the standing committee with detailed plans regarding the decentralization by community by position and with time frames .
however it was disappointing that no department presented a clear articulation of what this means .
members do not want the government of nunavut to take that risk .
members welcome this beginning and encourage a collective effort to build on it .
recommendation .
that the cabinet build a strong policy statement about their commitment to inuit qaujimanituqangit as the foundation of the government of nunavut .
community input and support
as noted above , all departments spoke of their commitment in making inuit qaujimanituqangit a foundation of their work , however , there are very few details as to how this will happen .
the standing committee welcomes the stated commitments to work with our communities .
however , even when the departments give an example of community bodies and organizations that they wish to work with in the future , few details were provided as to how this would happen .
the standing committee notes that the gnwt government had a stated commitment to community empowerment and in the past they negotiated the transfer of responsibilities to some communities in nunavut .
as well they should support women elders by using the status of women funding . these are but to name a few .
that the departments develop detailed plans for integrating elders in policy development and program delivery within their mandate . sharing of information in the budget review process .
that the departments should provide mid-year progress reports that would be reviewed by the standing committee in october of this year , 1999 .
they should include detailing the programs which have been initiated to date , they should outline specific expenditures to date and entitlements and providing information on plans for the remaining fiscal year .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
i think before we take a break , i would like to recognize someone .
mr. nutarak , i &apos;m sorry , mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
mr. speaker , my comments are finally ended but i have a couple of motions .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. nutarak would like unanimous consent to waive 91 ( 4 ) and table the report of the standing committee to the committee of the whole .
are there any nays ?
mr. nutarak you have received unanimous consent and the rule 91 ( 4 ) has been waived and the report will be presented later on .

speaker :
chairperson , ( mr. iqaqrialu ) ( interpretation ) :
ok , we will follow the procedures during this committee of the whole .
yesterday we were dealing with the estimates and at this time we will move on to human resources .
are there any other questions or comments to be made in that department ?
hon. kelvin ng :
i am pleased to present the main estimates for the department of human resources for the fiscal year 1999 / 2000 .
this department is a central agency which provides a wide range of services to the entire government in areas such as recruitment , training and development , job evaluation and labour relations .
there was no equivalent department in the previous government prior to the division .
the department of human resources has a close relationship with the department of finance and administration , which manages the payroll system and participates in collective bargaining .
the largest component of the budget is removals to and from the community of employment and recruitment at about 6.3 million dollars .
the department has no capital funding in its budget .
to carry out the activities of the department we currently have in place seventeen employees at headquarters and four in the regions .
i am pleased to tell you that 68 % of the staff are inuit .
hiring for the baffin regional office in igloolik will not take place until office space and staff housing are available .
current plans call for infrastructure to be available in 2000 .
the regional human resource services will be handled out of head quarters operation until then .
the departments first priority is staffing up its own operation and providing centralized recruiting services to other departments who are doing the same thing .
the biggest challenge we will face over the coming years is the renewal of the collective agreements .
the two unions , the federation of nunavut teachers , and the nunavut employees union have both served notice to commence negotiations .
finally i expect the department to be a positive force in promoting a stable and representative work force that reflects the values and the vision of our government .
mr. chairman i would be happy to answer any questions that the members may have .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you kelvin .
the government operations committee chairperson , mr. akesuk , i believe has a comment to make .
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. tootoo will make comments
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
go ahead then , mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman this is comments from the standing committee report on government operations as it relates to the department of human resources .
minister ng appeared before the committee on the morning of april 29th .
the main estimates summary provided to the committee indicated a total of 1999 / 2000 expenditures of $ 10,835,523.00 .
the committee again recognizes the central agency function of the department and has the following brief comments and observations .
on competency based human resource systems , the departments &apos; draft business plan stresses the need to remove artificial academic requirements in its &apos; job evaluation system .
the competency-based system is intended to help achieve the inuit employment plan of the government .
the committee is supportive of efforts designed to maximize inuit employment in government and looks forward to regular updates in government wide progress in that area .
the committee looks forward to receiving information on progress in this area .
in regards to labour relations . the committee was informed that the department has not yet staffed the position of director of labour relations .
the committee was advised that when the position is staffed the department will be able to start developing a strategy in this area .
the departmental organization charts .
the committee was advised that departments are currently in the process of having their organizational charts receive final approval .
when the approval process has concluded the committee would like to be provided on a regular basis , updates on each government of nunavut departments progress on staff up .
mr. chairman , that concludes my comments on that .
i would beg your indulgence . i have a couple of motions to read .
committee motion 5 - 1 ( 2 ) :
regular reports on staffing gn departments
mr. chairman i move that the committee , that this committee recommends that the department of human resources provides the committee with regular progress reports on staffing the government of nunavut departments .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
there is a motion on the floor any questions or comments to the motion ?
if there is no comments , are you in favour ?
i believe everyone is agreed .
you are in agreement , we have to find out whether you are in agreement or not .
agreed ?
but i will only find out if you have a show of hands .
all in favour ?
show of hands please .
ok we are in agreement .
thank you . mr. tootoo did you have another comment to make ?
go ahead .
committee motion 6 - 1 ( 2 ) :

mr. tootoo :

mr. chairman , i move that this committee recommend that the department provide mid year progress report to the standing committee for review in october of this year .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :

if there are no question , do you agree ?
motion carried .
do you have anything else mr. tootoo ?
thank you , if you have no further comments , mr. ng .
i believe that you would like to make a report .

hon. kelvin ng :

any questions or comments ? o &apos;brien ?
thank you mr. chairman .
i don &apos;t have any general comments but i do have a , i guess a general question mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. ng do you have a response please .
hon. kelvin ng .
yes , thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , the government of nunavut , the cabinet , hasn &apos;t tasked any specific minister or any department right now with the lead on the whole decentralization issue .
it is within the prerogative of the premier right now and executive right now by the mere fact that it has not been passed on to anybody specifically .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. o &apos;brien , i have a hard time remembering your name , but go ahead .
mr. o &apos;brien :
it is okay mr. chairman , you can call me what ever you feel is appropriate .
i have been called many names .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien , your response mr. minister .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , obviously we have a critical role in respect of supporting the departments wherever they may be in recruiting for their positions .
that is the centralized support that this department provides , and also in respect to holding the benefits of the relocation of the new employees and the development of staffing .
so those are the key areas .
the provision of being involved in the acquisition of the staff housing as well .
those responsibilities lie within this department .
that is the critical support that we will provide to for the decentralization of government positions .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. o &apos;brien ?
mr. o &apos;brien :
in reference to training for decentralized jobs .
what is the status on your training plan ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. minister would you respond to that ?
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
i am told that right now through the involvement of the nuhrds strategy , that there are forty two individuals who are funded under that program or within our system .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. o &apos;brien , go ahead .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
we haven &apos;t got into that debate yet and obviously everybody recognizes the importance of the issue , so i will certainly relay that back to him .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister and mr. o &apos;brien .
at this time mr. puqiqnak ?
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
my name is not pokniknak it is puqiqnak .
mr. chairman thank you .
the minister stated this morning that there would be a liquor outlet in uqsuqtuq and there was a comment made that we would not want to be a liquor outlet based in uqsuqtuq .
whether it is , if they don &apos;t want it in uqsuqtuq , which other communities are you looking at ?
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
the minister would like to answer that question ? hon. kelvin ng :
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. puqiqnak , i believe you have another question .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
that &apos;s the understanding that i got from reading the report .
i would like everyone out there to understand that .
it is not going to be the liquor warehouse that is going to base there it is the liquor licensing board that would be there .
we have been getting the proper information out to our community in that regard .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
at this time we are not , we are on the issue of human resources .
let us stick to the item , we are not talking about the liquor licensing board here .
that is for your information .
mr. puqiqnak do you have another comment to make ?
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
i just wanted to get the people the proper information .
chairperson ( interpretation ) : well , you could have got that information out in a brief comment because of course when you start debating you tend to spend a long time .
ok , any comments ?
irqittuq ?
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
my friend down there at the witness table .
when i posed my question earlier you didn &apos;t give any direct response but my question was whether this could have taken place on april 1 with the creation of nunavut .
with the relocation dollars for staff , what is going to be happening now with that money that was earmarked for our relocating staff to igloolik ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
we talked about that this morning .
regarding the igloolik school , mr. minister if you would respond to that question .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
we couldn &apos;t have had it up and running on april 1 , because there wasn &apos;t a department in the gnwt so there was no positions established for april 1 .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i believe mr. irqittuq has another question .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
i realize that they &apos;re in one pot of money , but is it possible to reserve those dollars so that they can generate interest ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
if you would respond to that question mr. minister .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairperson .
as it stands now that is the allocation that is within the budget and until we get into operations we won &apos;t know if it is sufficient or insufficient .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. irqittuq , any further questions .
thank you for your response mr. minister .
any other items ?
maybe later .
thank you mr. irqittuq for forgetting your question .
mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
in regards to human resources i would like to make a comment .
the larger communities will , of course , have employment positions and there are the smaller communities that have been asking for employment positions .
i think we have a tendency to forget about the smaller communities and dollars are not allocated for the smaller communities .
what kind of plan do you have so that the smaller communities , like pelly bay or repulse bay , are included in these decentralization plans ?
i would like clarification on this point .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
mr. minister your response please .
hon. kelvin ng :
well mr. chairperson , i don &apos;t know if i can respond to that question .
we know that it didn &apos;t take into account every single community , it tried to focus on establishing functional government offices in several locations .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
i don &apos;t believe that &apos;s a question .
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
first of all i would like to ask about those communities that were going to get decentralized positions .
their infrastructure has been built already but some of the building materials have still not been getting into the communities .
will they be going into the communities this year on sealift ?
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. minister .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairperson .
mr. chairperson , as i think i answered to mr. nutarak on nunavut construction .
thank you , .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. akesuk , i think you have another question .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. minister you want to respond . ?
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairperson .
yes that goes back to the whole basis of the decentralized discussion that took place earlier today and over the past .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
do you have another question mr. akesuk ?
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
mr. minister the communities will have to receive those decentralized py &apos;s and they are going to need office space and staff housing and we want to see more positions decentralized from the government .
i wonder if there has been additional training provided to those people who are slated to be moved to the communities ?
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. akesuk .
mr. ng if you wish to respond to that ?
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairperson .
so there are various programs that have been funded to try and bring up the level of experience and skills overall throughout nunavut .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
i think those are all the questions you have .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i don &apos;t know if this is your department or not , so correct me if it isn &apos;t .
a two bedroom apartment they get for , i think the figure is 1200 dollars a month , and the utilities are paid for .
in a place like baker lake and arviat , possibly rankin inlet , you can check that , it &apos;s different too .
there was leases signed in the previous government that had to come over according to the nunavut act .
so you have people in rankin inlet in private accommodations that are paying 2 thousand to 2,500 dollars a month for accommodations .
is the minister committed to , i don &apos;t know if this is his department , to making it fair , equitable and transparent like we have been told .
to make sure that government employees are all treated the same , whether they are in iqaluit or pelly bay or baker lake or repulse bay or coral harbour ?
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
minister ng , i think you can clarify that question .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairperson .
mr. chairman the department of human resources is involved in the allocation of staff housing units and also in the review and development of policies regarding staff housing .
the department of public works , telecommunications &amp; technical services is involved in the actual leasing portion of that .
but , yes i am aware of the discrepancies between headquarters and regional staff in some of the regional centres and we are going to try and bring some consistency to the whole issue .
it is , as you indicated , a bit complex , there are some units and leases that we have inherited from the gnwt , there are others that we inherited from the oic .
so there &apos;s different factors that have to be taken into consideration .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. mclean you have more questions .
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. speaker .
something that has come up in the last few months , and we are a small territory spread out over a vast distance .
we talked about this in other matters in regard to conflict of interest and the misunderstandings that people have .
my fear is that if we are not very vigilant , that direct appointments may come back to haunt us .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. mclean .
mr. minister would you respond to that ?
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairperson .
mr. chairperson , cabinet is the only legal mechanism that can appoint individuals directly into positions of this government .
so there are certain criteria that have to be met before direct appointments can be made .
if it is eia , they can provide that information .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. mclean you can go ahead and ask another question .
mr. mclean :
this will be my last one mr. chairman for now .
thank you .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) : thank you mr. mclean .
mr. ng do you have a comment to make to that ?
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairperson .
you meant for all of the departments of government i take it ?
yes .
we will see what we can provide in a summary form .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. tootoo , iqaluit centre , you have the floor .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairperson .
just a few questions to follow up on mr. mclean about the organizational chart .
have all departments have finalized organizational charts at this time ?
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. minister .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i am told we don &apos;t have all of them in yet from all of the departments .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
go ahead mr. tootoo , you have another question .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairperson .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
i think mr. minister you can provide a better response to that .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairperson .
mr. chairperson it is probably more appropriate when they come up about their specific organizational chart .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo , you can continue .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairperson .
the minister indicated in his opening remarks that they have 17 employees in headquarters and four in the regions .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. minister .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , i like boss .
anyway , yes we have an approved org. chart with 47 positions and 17 filled out of 47 .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
you have another one mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairperson .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. minister . boss ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i can &apos;t say for sure , i mean obviously there is a priority right now because we are one of the departments that provides the human resource support for the other departments .
so cabinet has recognized it as a priority in trying to get this as one of the departments to try and get staffed up first and we are trying to do that .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you boss ng .
i also want you to know when i say minister i am trying to speak english .
i think irqittuq , you wanted to ask another question .
go ahead .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
the minister at the witness table , i have some more questions to ask of him .
will they need to have the same qualifications as the ones hired in iqaluit , or has there been some consideration given to experience or equivalencies ?
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq , your question is in order .
minister .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairperson .
that is where the department is moving , the whole government of nunavut , so your evaluation is based more on being able to do the job more than your technical background .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
i think you have another question mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
the jobs which will be advertised and , so no matter where the jobs are , will you be looking at the residents first before hiring outside of the community ?
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
minister ng did you want to respond to that ?
hon. kelvin ng :
yes mr. chairperson .
yes most definitely , if the positions can be filled locally that would be the first priority .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
are there any other comments or questions under human resources , while the minister is at the witness table ?
mr. mclean , go ahead . i apologize , mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairperson .
mr. chairman , my question is in relationship to pay equity .
i am just wondering if the minister can give us an update as to where this issue stands , in relation to implementing a gender neutral job evaluation system for the new nunavut government ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister ng you may respond please .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairperson .
so all the positions that were transferred to nunavut after division came over with the new job evaluation method and the new hay plan as well .
in addition to that , the newly created positions for headquarters whether it is in iqaluit , we are all being evaluated using that plan as well .
so it is all gender neutral .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. o &apos;brien further comments .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairperson .
are things kosher , are we anticipating any problems with this system that we have inherited ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
minister ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairperson .
it is our understanding that at this point in time there are not problems with the new job evaluation system .
i believe there is some mechanism for an appeal system for those individuals who feel that they were not properly categorized within certain pay ranges .
but , generally , broadly across the board , most of the problems are gone , we feel .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. o &apos;brien would you like to ask another question .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairperson . my final question is in reference to the affirmative action policy .
if you could give the members a brief update as to where this issue stands with your department . chairperson ( interpretation ) :
minister ng , either you or one of your officials could respond . ms. aglukkaaq :
thank you mr. chairperson . the affirmative action policy was transferred over to the government of nunavut .
there were minor revisions to it and we have incorporated the article 23 , inuit beneficiary preference , as priority one under the policy .
so any recruitment plans that we have in place , individuals are required to identify whether they are beneficiaries of the claim or not , to be considered into any positions .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you very much mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
any other questions or comments to the department of human resources ?
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairperson .
my question relates to an issue that was mentioned earlier .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. tootoo .
mr. ng , or one of your officials can reply .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i don &apos;t know the total numbers that had been staffed , i can tell you that there &apos;s only been two direct appointment made by this cabinet .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo would you like to make another comment .
m. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
yes , because those two individuals completed their management training program with arctic college and had a specific interest actually in the department of finance , that &apos;s why i know those two individuals .
thank you .
if i may add , those two positions are targeted for decentralization to one of the communities , when they complete their training as will . thank you .
chairperson :
( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo , you may go ahead and ask your question .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
another issue that was raised earlier in regards to the last question about affirmative action .
how does the department rate their , someone that is a long term resident , that may not be a beneficiary of nunavut , but was born here and lived here all their lives ?
will those individuals still receive preferential treatment under the affirmative action program ?
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , on the affirmative action policy , they would be designated priority through category .
thank you .
chairperson :
( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
questions or comments , mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
i was listening to mr. tootoo , through translation , but it &apos;s okay .
in regards to human resources , when we discuss this matter , i just remembered , that we &apos;ve been thinking about the article 23 .
after the nunavut government had been established we have to utilize and do our business according to article 23 .
it seems quite embarrassing , although we had worked very hard , but it &apos;s quite embarrassing , because we are not utilizing the article 23 .
we have to do something according to article 23 and 24 because we have to abide by those articles .
thank you .
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
right now i want the members to be aware that i am now using clyde river dialect .
mr. ng , you may respond now .
in regards to your question , seems like your question should be directed to the minister of health and social services .
mr. ng , you could respond to it if you &apos;d like .
hon. kelvin ng :
minister , i &apos;ll let them .
when his budget comes up it &apos;s probably more appropriate .
&gt; &gt; applause
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
mr. puqiqnak , i think he answered your questions , do you have any further comments ?
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank your mr. chairman . in regards to human resources , i thought we were dealing with human resources .
as nunavut residents should have employment opportunities and we should also be contracting nunavut residents .
i wanted to ask you a question , because we would like to do things according to article 23 .
thank you .
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
department of human resources minister ng , would you like to respond .
thank you .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
i think that members &apos; questions are better probably raised when public works , telecommunications comes up in respect of contracting provisions of article 24 .
when the department of health and social services boards comes up in respect to that same provision with the contracts that were let by the board .
thank you .
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
the clock is ticking and we &apos;ve got a few issues to cover , mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk :
thank you mr. chairman , back to housing and staff .
can you advise us if there is a staff housing policy or provide us with the details .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. akesuk .
mr. ng
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. akesuk
mr. akesuk :
thank you mr. chairman .
so you guys are using the gnwt housing policy ? thank you .
chairperson :
( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. akesuk .
mr. ng
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , yes we are using the gnwt allocation policy .
thank you . chairperson :
( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. tootoo your questions .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
in regards to staff housing policy and the allocations of staff housing units under the previous government , that was a responsibility for the financial management board that contracted to the nwt housing corporation .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo . mr. ng or aglukkaq .
ms. aglukkaq :
qujannamiik , itsivautaa .
it differs between regions .
in kitikmeot there &apos;s a committee that allocates the units for government units and that &apos;s with human resources , financial management board , public works .
in the keewatin it &apos;s a combination and there &apos;s also been contracts to maintain the units outside of government .
in the baffin , i believe with housing corporation that arrangement to maintain the government inventory of units was contracted to the housing authority .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. aglukkaaq .
mr. tootoo do you have any other questions ?
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. ng or ms. aglukkaaq
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. tootoo you may continue again .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo . mr. ng or ms. aglukkak
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. ng or ms. aglukkak
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , there &apos;s two different processes .
the two different processes from what i am understand , are a regional allocation committee and a headquarters allocation committee .
that &apos;s where some of the differences might be coming into play .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. minister , i think it does explain this as you said earlier that the same process was being followed .
there was only one committee , that was allocating units prior to april 1st and now it appears as you mentioned , you have two separate committees allocating units .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
i don &apos;t think your looking at any other response now mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , well before april 1st my understanding is the oic had an allocation committee and gnwt had a regional allocation committee .
so after april 1st , that &apos;s where you end up with the two committees .
i mean those are the kind of things that we &apos;re trying to streamline in the development of a new government of nunavut policy in relation to staff housing . thank you .
chairperson :
( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
is that end of your time mr. tootoo ?
thank you mr. tootoo , any further comments or questions ?
i believe you &apos;re looking at the page 4 - 4 operations and maintenance .
the total operations and maintenance budget .
again i read this as $ 687.00 , i believe this is $ 687 thousand dollars are there any comments to the amounts .
all the members have agreed , thank you .
capital items , total capital , nothing , so the total expenditures for the directorate is $ 687 , for those in agreement .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
should we even mention capital when there &apos;s no purchases or no budget for capital items .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
are you following the same book ?
i &apos;ve been told that although there is no amount in these slots , we still have to refer to them because again that &apos;s part of the government protocol .
for total capital , the total expenditures and there is no total capital , so therefore the total expenditures for policy and planning is $ 116 thousand are you agreed , good .
are you agreed , you guys agreed before you even ask for the agreement .
thank you .
4 - 7 , assistant deputy minister , operations and maintenance , total operation and maintenance 3 million , 780 thousand .
are you agreed , mr. tootoo did you make a comment to this item ?
proceed .
mr. tootoo :
looking under this as an assistant deputy minister , for further training programs for the government , earlier the minister mentioned the emba program that was done jointly with the nuhrds .
i was wondering if this is something that is going to be continued in the future , or is that something outside the departments &apos; budget .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. ng do you wish to respond to this ?
hon. kelvin ng :
mr. chairman , that &apos;s something that &apos;s outside the budget .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i was speaking to myself for a second there , thank you for reminding me .
the capital items there &apos;s a zero balance , so therefore the total expenditure is 3 million , 780 thousand dollars .
are you agreed .
now turn to page 4 - 8 this is primarily information item , distribution budget , are you agreed ?
now to return to 4 - 3 the details of expenditures , operations and maintenance total operations and maintenance is 10 million , 836 thousand dollars .
are you agreed ?
capital items , total capital items is zero balance , therefore total expenditures is 10 million , 836 thousand dollars .
are you agreed ?
you may applaud .
we need to complete this , have you agreed that we have completed the human resources budget ?
i would just like to thank the minister and officials for having their presentation .
agreed .
thank you .
i would like to thank mr. ng , and his assistant deputy minister , because they took the time .
now to go back to orders of the day and my question to you now because we still have to deal with the justice .
how do you wish to proceed in respect to the meeting item .
o &apos;brien there he is .
mr. o &apos;brien :

i &apos;m sorry you cannot make a motion , you can only agreed to this at the committee , you either have to agree or state , are you agreed .
thank you this has been concluded , i &apos;m sorry those who are against , none against .
at this time in respect to the justice meeting item , i didn &apos;t quite understand , excuse me for a second .
now the speaker will return to his seat or do you wish to make a comment ?

ministers &apos; statement 12 - 1 ( 2 ) :
arviat p3 project
hon. hon. kelvin ng .
mr. speaker , i am very pleased to announce that the government of nunavut has signed a public-private partnership agreement with the arviat development corporation for the health facility in arviat .
this is the first p3 project agreement in nunavut and the northwest territories .
public-private partnerships are a financing alternative in which the government partners with a private sector business to provide some of the government &apos;s infrastructure needs .
the private business invests in the project and then enters into an operating lease with the government .
in today &apos;s dollars , this project is worth approximately ten ( 10 ) million dollars .
mr. guy alikut , ms. cleo prellwitz , and mr. joe manik .
they deserve great credit in bringing this much needed health centre to arviat .
it is expected that the design work for the health centre will be completed by the end of may with the construction schedule to begin early this fall .
this agreement is significant because it lays the foundation for future p3 projects in nunavut .
we believe that all of this has been achieved in this agreement .
thank you , mr. speaker .

new health centre in arviat
hon. hon. ed picco ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker , ( english ) i want to take this opportunity to reinforce the earlier comments made by minister ng .
this agreement officially launches the work on a new health centre in arviat , which should be ready early in the year 20000 .
this is an important project and has been one of my department &apos;s highest priorities .
it is the first of four health facilities on the government &apos;s list of possible p3 projects and i look forward to seeing progress made on those projects in the near future .
oqaqti , many people have worked very hard to get the arviat project to this point today and i would like to thank them for their commitment to this project .

members &apos; statement 39 - 1 ( 2 ) :
cbc and consensus government
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. speaker .
listening to the c.b.c. this morning , i understand that the media have started to refer to members on this side of the house as nunavut &apos;s opposition .
a pretty snap decision considering that this is only our sixth day in this session .
it took god a full week to create the world .
i guess the media needs less time to define this assembly .
&gt; &gt; applause :
hear hear
the term opposition suggests discord for the sake of appearing different , attacking to score cheap political points .
mr. speaker , the regular members of the assembly have made very clear their desire to work with the government to make nunavut a better place for all .
to be consulted , and to have input on the issues facing us all .
it &apos;s simply not correct to suggest that we have something to gain by acting as knee jerk opposition to anything the government says or does .
that &apos;s not opposition mr. speaker , that &apos;s accountability .
there is a big difference .
thank you .

mr. tootoo .
members &apos; statement 40 - 1 ( 2 ) :
need for school buses in iqaluit
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i rise to make a statement on the issue of school busing here in iqaluit .
as the members are aware the population of iqaluit is increasing as more and more public servants are moving to iqaluit .
they move to iqaluit with their families .
mr. speaker , next year the new middle school will open at the top of the hill , but the two elementary schools will still be bursting at the seams with new students .
while the numbers of classrooms is increasing , we have to consider the other services for which there will also be an increased demand , such as school bussing .
mr. speaker i want to make the point that these are examples of forced growth .
the money allocated for services such as school bussing has to keep up with the demand due to more students .
to give members a sense of the problem , one bus for the middle school can hold forty four students per trip .
mr. speaker , next year there is funding for two busses which is the current level right now , two busses and one handicapped bus for the three schools .
this is not enough .
i know the minister of education shares the concern that the budget must reflect forced growth issues and perhaps his department more than others is impacted by the increasing numbers .
in this case the number of students .
but communities such as iqaluit and other decentralized communities that will be facing the same problem cannot be expected to absorb the impact of forced growth .
the government of nunavut must consider it in their locations of funding communities .
thank you mr. speaker .

mr. o &apos;brien ?
question 51 - 1 ( 2 ) :
boarding home contract
mr. o &apos;brien :
mr. speaker , my question is directed to the minister responsible for health and social services and it involves the recent rewarding of a contract regarding the ublivik centre .
thank you mr. o &apos;brien . minister picco .
thank you mr. speaker .
for clarity mr. speaker if you would bear with me i would like to give a background on the reason for the r.f.p. and a chronological sequence of events on the r.f.p.
in december of 1998 , the keewatin health and social services board requested a request for proposals , in other words an r.f.p. , for patient boarding facilities and transportation services in winnipeg .
they did this rather than negotiating a contract with the current service provider for the following reasons .
the formal contract between the health board and the deliverer of the boarding home services expired in 1995 .
both parties had concerns with the terms and conditions of said verbal arrangements .
as well as in 1996 / 1997 and again in 1998 , the board had directed the chief executive officer of the keewatin health and social services board to issue an r.f.p ..
following up on this , mr. speaker , an r.f.p. was issued closing at 3 : 00 p.m. central standard time march , 18 , 1999 .
a committee reviewed the proposals in rankin inlet on april 14 , 1999 and selected t.c.
enterprises .
now , mr. speaker , the board &apos;s evaluation team was charged with determining which of the proposals provided the best value .
the team had to weigh many factors including the cost to the taxpayers , the quality of service to be provided , and the implementation of article 24 .
t.c.
enterprises satisfied the board evaluation team that it could provide the quality of services of our patients and families at a price the government can afford .
mr. speaker , following up on the second part of the question by mr. o &apos;brien the contract will take effect on july 1 , 1999 .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. o &apos;brien
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker can the minister confirm whether or not the cost , the actual cost was the sole deciding factor in this contract ?
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. picco
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker i think it is fair to say that the cost of the proposal , the successful proponent was the mitigating factor in awarding this contract .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , that partly answered my question .
i will try to make it a little more clear .
the successful winner , i guess , of the contract , who was awarded the contract , did they have the lowest cost .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
sorry this was the second supplementary , you have two more supplementaries .
one more , sorry .
mr. picco , minister of health and social services .
hon. ed picco :
it wasn &apos;t public .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
final supplementary , mr. o &apos;brien
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i used up my last two supplementaries and didn &apos;t get an answer , therefore , there &apos;s only one supplementary left , so i &apos;ll try again .
the successful bidder , did they have the lowest cost , the bottom line was it dollars .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. picco minister of health and social services .

can the minister tell me how many companies had proposals .
speaker : ( interpretation ) :

mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker , mr. speaker cost was one of the factors as explained earlier in the oral question to mr. o &apos;brien .
the rfp was put out by the keewatin regional health and social services board .
there are other factors that were looked into and i had mentioned some of them , article 24 for an example , the quality of service with the proposal itself .
the other factors are in rfp which are public knowledge because those were requested in the ad .

hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , if you would like to answer the question , i could no , no .
thank you mr. speaker .
i can understand why there would be some disappointment that another contractor has been selected .
so i understand the experience and the dedication of mrs. penner .
i think it &apos;s just when the rfp came forward , the criteria was set out and everyone was on an equal footing .
the keewatin regional health and social services board picked the contractor , that the final contract was awarded to based on the criteria that was in place .
it was a fair , sound process and i understand there would be disappointment from the person who had run the contract for several years .
as i explained earlier , the contract was holdover since 1995 , it was a verbal commitment .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :

sanikiluaq interpreters for assembly
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i wanted to ask the minister of culture , language , elders &amp; youth , mr. havioyak .
the first year that we were here ;
perhaps i should make a comment first .
i don &apos;t want to lose my own dialect or my language and to make everybody understand what i am saying , i will be using a dialect that is not my own .
i value my own dialect .
i spoke to the minister earlier this year that perhaps we should hire an interpreter from sanikiluaq once in a while .
i am going to have to borrow dialects to be understood here , i know that if i used my own dialect , that minister would not understand what i am trying to say .
i wonder if you have been told about that before , that we need to have the sanikiluaq dialect interpreted here at the house ?
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
this is one of the responsibilities of the legislative assembly , so i will have a talk with the clerk of the legislative assembly about that .

mr. mclean .
question 63 - 1 ( 2 ) :
status of positions with education boards
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question is to the minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
in regards to the phasing out of the education boards and the news release the boards will be phased out during the next year and no jobs are expected .
mr. minister , could you please give me details where the 12 people employed in the board office in baker lake will be employed next year ?
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. mclean .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
yes , the policy objective , which we achieved through the cabinet , is a no lay-off policy .
if a divisional board office is in baker lake then the employees will be in baker lake .
there is no plan for kitikmeot and kivalliq to move there headquarters , regional offices somewhere else , only in the baffin is the regional office to be relocated to pangnirtung .
everywhere else , we have no plans to relocate the staff , if the relocation isn &apos;t necessary .
however , i would like to add for the member , that because of the divisional boards elimination plan , we will probably require less administration and financial personnel .
that may not be required after july 1 , 2000 .
speaker :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question again for the minister .
could the minister give me a time line as to when these employees can be advised of their options ?

question 64 - 1 ( 2 ) :
vacant decentralization infrastructure
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question concerns decentralization .
since we don &apos;t have a minister in charge of decentralization , i will pose my question to the minister of public works , telecommunications &amp; technical services .
mr. speaker , we spent millions and millions of dollars in some of our communities constructing office buildings and accommodations .
in some cases houses have been completed and boarded up for the winter .
these buildings have been heated but empty .
we have a number of people , i believe there are seven people at least , that have been hired and waiting to take up office accommodations , unfortunately the building &apos;s not available .
we are also told that there are no phones available , northwestel is not able to hook the phones up until august .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
minister thompson .
hon. manitok thompson :
this is a question to the finance minister .
thank you .
speaker :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker and i thank my colleague for referring the question to me .
i think in yesterday &apos;s committee debates on the departments of finance &amp; administration , and human resources that issue came up .
several members had questioned the timing and availability of staff housing and office space in their communities to accommodate some of these decentralized positions .
i understand that some assets are in the stage right now of being transferred to the government of nunavut .
but it is my understanding that as of today that we don &apos;t have any of those units within our jurisdiction but it is in process .
thank you .
speaker :
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker it is my understanding , and again i am not sure , but some of these units are actually turned over .
so i would ask the minister if he could give me a firmer time line , as i have said we have staff that have been hired .
we have people that are waiting to move in , they don &apos;t have accommodations .
so if you could give me some date that i could bring back home to the people .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker as i said , i don &apos;t know , i don &apos;t have the specific details here .
possibly the deputy minister of public works , telecommunications &amp; technical services , who was involved in the lease negotiations may have more specific detailed information .
if he doesn &apos;t , i will certainly make a point of finding out as soon as possible .
thank you . speaker :
mr. o &apos;brien . mr. o &apos;brien :
one last point mr. speaker .
this is more a comment , if the minister could look into that to see if it could be corrected .
thank you .
speaker :
mr. ng .
mr. o &apos;brien , a comment when you are asking oral questions you have to make sure you are asking the same question , you are changing the question now . thank you .
question 65 - 1 ( 2 ) :
disease prevention , incidence of illness
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question is directed to the minister of health &amp; social services .
the communities see a lot more illness nowadays in their communities .
what can be done in nunavut for the prevention of serious illness ?

minister of health &amp; social services , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
i wonder if the member could rephrase his question .
speaker :
mr. picco , please listen .
this is a question for the minister of health .
mr. alakannuark , could you please clarify your question ?
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
this is for the minister of health .
more and more people are getting serious illnesses in communities .
maybe the problems are caused by food , contamination in the food chain , or from the environment .
would it be possible to monitor the reasons why more people are getting sick in the communities .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
minster of health mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker over the past several weeks now we have heard , for example , the first instances of diabetes are being seen more prevalently .
one of the factors that the medical people are telling us is that with the changing patterns and lifestyles of the people of nunavut , indeed one main factor would be the diets .
indeed , the rates of cancer have increased .
right now in nunavut under the department of health , we really don &apos;t have the capacity to track individual diseases and so forth , we are actually contracting back some of these service .
the department of health has been monitoring through the regional health boards the different instances and rates of the different diseases .
one of the factors for the changing patterns of health and the new instances of different diseases has been the changes in lifestyle and the changes in consumption of food products as one example .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
okay question period is over .

to the appropriate minister of public works , telecommunications , minister manitok thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
can i talk , can i do my opening comments now for pubic works ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
you may go ahead .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i will do my opening comments for the public works , and after i do my comments i &apos;ll go down to the witness chair with my officials .
thank you mr. chairman , for the opportunity to make some introductory remarks on the business plan as it relates to the budget for the department of public works , telecommunications and technical services .
this covers the time period of 1999 and 2000 .
the main estimates for the department are divided as follows :
$ 67.1 million for o &amp; m.
$ 5.7 million for capital .
although there are a number of headquarter positions that remain to be filled , the department has well established regional offices in baffin , keewatin and kitikmeot regions .
out of the 108 positions in the regional operations in the larger communities , a total of 40 are staffed by inuit .
this represents 37 % of the workforce in the department .
all regional public works , telecommunications and technical services offices are ensuring that services are being provided without interruption while the headquarters positions are bring staffed .
the services provided are purchasing and contracting :
building maintenance and the delivery of petroleum products .
the department is contracting services from the department of public works and services gnwt .
this will fill the gap in skills until they are developed in nunavut .
the decentralization plan for the department is proceeding .
this is scheduled to begin in the year 2000 as additional housing and office space becomes available .
there are now a total of 46 housing units and 3 office buildings completed .
these are located in communities in all three regions where regional offices will be located .
the department also manages the petroleum products revolving fund .
this fund i strictly for the financing of fuel inventory , and operating expenses and is recovered through the pricing structure .
public works also manages a large budget on behalf of client departments who are constructing buildings as part of their capital plan .
the department provides a high degree of services in order to ensure the necessary requirements are met .
the department also intends to review the standards and criteria used to determine capital expenditures .
the intent will be to designing criteria that meet the specific needs of nunavut .
all interested parties will be contracted for input including the mlas through the standing committees .
current criteria were carried over from the gnwt in order to ensure that some standards were in place until a review .
central purchasing is also a major task handled by the department .
this represents a significant opportunity for nunavuts &apos; businesses to develop and grow .
the department ensures contracts and purchases meet all the requirements of article 24 of the nunavut land claims agreement , in addition to the government &apos;s purchasing regulations .
a review will be undertaken with nti to ensure that the policies meet the needs of nunavut and article 24 .
one of the largest divisions in the department is petroleum products .
petroleum products is responsible for providing fuels to the communities of nunavut .
the fuel is distributed by local contractors employing local people .
this division has annual revenues of over 1.4 million dollars .
fuel is supplied by ships or barges during the resupply period in the summer time .
there is currently a contract in place with ntcl to supply this fuel until the end of year 2001 .
this will provide time to allow a review of the options available to lower costs .
this will be done in conjunction with a review of the eastern arctic sealift which is co-ordinated by the coast guard until the year 2000 .
there are no problems being anticipated at this time .
i hope these comments have been informative and i hope that i have been clear .
so i am ready to go down to the witness chair .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. thompson .
you may go to the witness chair with your officials .
ms. thompson could you introduce your officials please ?

mr. tootoo .

you can call me angayuqqaaq anytime you want . i &apos;ll have ross respond to his question , mr. mrazek , rather .
mr. tootoo : thank you , mr. chairman .

i &apos;m just wondering if that &apos;s the case .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. tootoo .
i &apos;m sure your comment was understood or your question was .
please proceed , mr. deputy minister ?
mr. mrazek :
yes , you &apos;re completely right .
funding is directly provided through the community government , housing , &amp; transportation as the funding agencies .
public works is providing the technical advice , technical assistance .
only after , we will be able to staff a few positions to help .
meantime we are working on a temporary arrangement with several communities in order provide response to them on a technical basis .

mr. tootoo , perhaps if you could make your comments or questions more concise , perhaps you &apos;ll get a more complete answer .
mr. tootoo ?
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. chairman , i &apos;ll try .
thank you , mr. chairman .
mr. mrazek :
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. mrazek .

i didn &apos;t quite catch who raised his hand .
i don &apos;t know whether it was mr. kattuk or mr. akesuk .
which of you raised your hands ?
oh , it was mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ?
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
i have just a comment .
perhaps the opening comments read by the minister when she was still sitting in her seat .
i would like to get a written copy of the opening comments read by the minister .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. akesuk .
could you give her a copy ?
thank you , mr. minister .
hon. manitok thompson :
if there is a copying machine , they are available .
the copies of my opening comments is available .
i &apos;m not sure who or whether the legislative assembly clerks , i believe they deal with requests for copies .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , ms. thompson .
mr. akesuk ?
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
ms. thompson or mrazek , mr. mrazek ?
i hope i &apos;m correct in pronouncing that ?
mr. mrazek :
if i could get more clarification , i would appreciate that because we have a number of different types of housing in the communities .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. akesuk ?
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. chairman .
what are ... what is the average monthly payments for the maintenance of those empty units ?
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i &apos;m sorry i keep making mistakes in respect to the names .
i called mr. akesuk , i was trying to call someone else .
ms. thompson , could you respond please .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. chairman .
i might make mistakes because this is definitely a male department so i &apos;ll refer that to mr. mrazek .
mr. mrazek :
i would like to give a brief overview of the nunavut construction corporation activity .
so far , they have built 146 housing units in a number of the settlements .
this year , they will be building 104 , in total number , it will be 250 units by next summer 2000 .
you &apos;re right , there &apos;s nobody living in those units yet , some of are completed , some of them are not ;
they have a number of deficiencies , and the interim inspection has not been passed .
i think we will start paying the leases within the next month , and the amount of the leases is available but i don &apos;t have that with me .
i can supply that later on .
we &apos;re making arrangements currently to use one housing unit in arviat as the temporary office space for education .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. akesuk ?
mr. akesuk :
thank you .
i ran out of questions , thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
okay .
mr. o &apos;brien ?
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , it &apos;s my understanding that the department of indian affairs and northern development , the federal government has spent between eight and ten million dollars on information technology for nunavut government .
this was done through the office of interim commissioner .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. mrazek ?
mr. mrazek :
i &apos;m not familiar and i cannot confirm the expenditure on behalf of the oic office last year or year before .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. o &apos;brien ?
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. chairman .
i &apos;m not sure , did you indicate that there was fifteen million dollars that you were going to spend , okay ?
my question is ... is there any relationship or co-ordination between your department and , minister , and the department of education in reference to the information highway .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
which of you will provide a response to that ?
ms. thompson ?
hon. manitok thompson :
i &apos;ll let mr. mrazek add on to what i &apos;ve said .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we will also service the small communities with the department of education if we have to , but i &apos;ll let mr. mrazek elaborate more on that .
thank you .
mr. mrazek :
with that , i think we will put a little bit of light into it so member from arviat will get hopefully little bit clear picture .
eventually , all communities will be connected through the server and the main network .
we have just completed meetings last week with northwesttel and we tried to resolve a number of the telecommunication issues between government , between the northwesttel , between the ardicom and few other suppliers .
this thing is really a complex project .
i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m not able to give you a specific date but we have the three major communities operational .
we will be hooking up the arviat within the next several weeks and so is kugluktuk , which will be operational and other community will follow .
this progress , it &apos;s extremely complex ;
it takes a very lots of energy , manpower , and it &apos;s basically going every two weeks and there are very serious meetings and progress check outs .
i &apos;m sorry i cannot give you anymore specific dates , but it &apos;s definitely nothing more original than to have all the communities connected in all through the intercom .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. mrazek .
mr. o &apos;brien ?
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. chairman .
thank you for that response , mr. mrazek .
so the people back in my home community will be pleased to hear that , we hope not for the next few weeks .
my next question is in reference to some clarification on the bip , the business incentive policy .
in article 24 , do we have anything in place at this point to say that the b.i.p. will be in place prior to the summer projects being started or concluded ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
ms. thompson ?
hon. manitok thompson :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i hope you will be able to understand that because they will be translated to english for sure .
perhaps mr. mrazek will speak to this point a little further so he can clarify the situation .
sometimes , when it goes through the translator , it kind of loses the meaning .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
do you wish to add on to this , mr. mrazek ?
mr. mrazek :
i would like to add just a few notes for the benefit of everybody .
this way , they benefit the companies and definitely benefit from that location .
and nti as the interim measure . mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. chairman .
thank you , mr. mrazek for that information .
i wonder if the minister and her staff can speak briefly to their current thinking on sealift options .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
ms. thompson .
mr. o &apos;brien :
i couldn &apos;t hear that ... my headset ... could she repeat that ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. chairman ... thank you , mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
in reference to sealift ;
have they reviewed sealift as it is ?
do they anticipate any changes as far as usage , schedules , and so on ... is there any ... we &apos;re thinking of existing sealift operations .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
ms. thompson ?
hon. manitok thompson :
thank you very much , mr. chairperson .
we &apos;re up to review anything now because we &apos;re the new government , i guess .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
please proceed .
mr. mrazek :
in case of sealift , you probably know that there is still contract with ntcl which government will be using .
i believe that contract will expire next year .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. o &apos;brien ?
i &apos;m sorry .
mr. puqiqnak was actually ahead .
please proceed .
go ahead , mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. chairman .
i would like to understand who the suppliers for the petroleum are .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i might be mistaken , i seem to know a little bit of it , so i would refer that to mr. mrazek .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
go ahead mr. mrazek .
mr. mrazek :
petroleum products division tenders the fuel supply every year on the world market .
one year you may get gasoline from amsterdam , and another year from venezuela , saudi arabia , and everywhere else .
it depends on who will give the government the best possible price for fuel or oil .
in the case of the keewatin it is usually through the port of churchill .
i hope that answers some of your questions .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
mr. chairperson , i would like to buy petroleum from saudi arabia because when i smell the petroleum here , it &apos;s smells better than the gas we have .
it has a sweeter smell than the fuel we have .
therefore i keep bringing that up .
i tend to believe that .
i wish to raise a question to you and your staff .
your review , or research into the petroleum products , when will that be completed ?
perhaps if you found out the reason for the gasoline problems , i would like to hear that as soon as possible .
even the search &amp; rescue vehicles were breaking down and that was causing a safety concern .
what are you going to do about this , what are your plans for this problem that we are having in gjoa haven .
starting in 1999 , in january , from then we have been sending letters to the gnwt and it &apos;s already been four months .
i am sorry , i have started to ramble on here , but i would like to find out about this .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i understand that he is trying to represent his community and he is doing a good job .
again , we are the conduits for anything whether it be pleasurable or not , because we are representing our community concerns because that is our mandate .
he is representing his community , i understand his comments properly and he raised a question in respect to the petroleum in gjoa haven .
although i understand now and when he posed his question i have kept trying to get a response on this .
my staff know exactly what has been happening in gjoa haven , as well as the research into the petroleum .
this is the one thing that i have understood today , the government research into the gasoline , they said that it was in acceptable levels .
i understand that the hamlet also had an independent researcher look into the make up of the petroleum .
i am not sure if this is true but i believe that they said it was acceptable .
this is the extent of my understanding on the matter .
in respect of the snowmobiles that were breaking down , i have heard about it through the radio , i heard the mayor alluding to this point .
there are a lot of factors involved in skidoo breakdowns , this i know , however , to date the research results have consistently come out saying that it is acceptable .
that &apos;s all i have at this time but i will be visiting gjoa haven and the residents to meet with them on this petroleum issue .
i am sorry that this has been like this for a while and i know that they &apos;re very displeased with it .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. puqiqnak , perhaps if you have questions other than the petroleum , because i know you will be dealing with that and the minister has stated that she will go to the community .
do you have any other questions in respect of some other matter for public works ?
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
mr. chairman , i also wanted to emphasize to the minister and her department the gasoline that caused the breakdowns this winter is going to be used again for the summer season .
i am sorry that i keep referring to gasoline and petroleum , because again this has caused a lot of stress in our community .
especially this winter .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i understand that the member doesn &apos;t want to meet tomorrow , and i accept that , i have other things to do i guess , it &apos;s okay .
i appreciate his comments , i don &apos;t know if i have any new items in regards to this , i am just a new minister .
i am sorry to say that , i am reviewing what has been going on with the departments .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. thompson . mr. puqiqnak are you done ?
don &apos;t give up just because you get refused once , you have to be persistent and that &apos;s why you were elected .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i think i should be sitting where you are madame minister , i think that i would be perfect for the job .
perhaps we should take a break , and copies of your opening comments could be made and we would feel much better to deal with the budget estimates , madame minister .
i do think that i would be good in your position as minister because i know all about the man things , like you said before .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
would you stand up madame minister and mr. iqaqrialu will take your place , just kidding .
let &apos;s take a short break to regroup after ms. thompson makes a comment .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
yes , i can do this group and don &apos;t patronize me because i am a female , because i know that i can work for pwtts , thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
we will regroup and get copies of the opening comments and come back shortly .
&gt; &gt; committee recessed at 4.38 pm and resumed at 4.57 pm .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you please take your seats .
we are not supposed to have coffee in the legislature , so please ensure that you don &apos;t bring your coffee in here .
i was told that even in the committee of the whole , that was the protocol .
the translations are still being carried out and when they are completed they will be handed out .
you will be receiving an english copy at this time .
again , the clock is running and i would like to return to our meeting .
mr. iqaqrialu , i believe mr. iqaqrialu has another question , we will not be voting on the matter right now .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. chairperson .
in regards to the bip that we just heard about , article 24 , that we just heard about .
this afternoon earlier in question period , contracts in regard to rfp &apos;s .
i am sure that these are awarded to the best proposal and if they have bip and if they have article 24 .
the problem that i see with rfp &apos;s , and i have asked the question earlier today to my colleagues , is that it is not necessarily the lowest bidder that gets it .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
ms. thompson .
ms. thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i would like to thank the member for his concern .
we had talked about that and we have the department working with other departments to see how we can deal with article 24 , in the nunavut government , in a public government .
i will have mr. mrazek update us on his discussions in regards to article 24 and bip for contracting in nunavut .
mr. mrazek will elaborate a little bit more on that .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. mrazek .
mr. mrazek :
i will try to describe the correct answer to mr. mclean specifically .
there is a major difference between a tender and a request for proposals .
tenders are completely public , request for proposal is not .
that doesn &apos;t mean that people are prevented from providing a request for proposal .
the only thing which contracting procedures , according to the financial administration manual are prohibiting is to disclose prices to the general public with a request for a proposal .
you will be basically comparing apples to oranges , technically , if you are disclosing that .
requests for proposals are evaluated on selected criteria , price is one of them , but obviously there are many others .
the evaluation process is completely fair , can be verified , it is usually a committee , and obviously the cost / benefit analysis , including bip and article 24 plays a major role .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. chairperson .
in the presentation out of 108 positions in regional operations , a total of 40 new are staffed by inuit .
this represents 37 % of the work force in the department .
the services provided are purchasing , contracting , building maintenance and delivery of petroleum products .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. mclean .
sorry ms. thompson , or mr. mrazek .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
we will make a commitment to do inuit employment plans for the department if it has not been done already .
i will be committed to bringing more inuit staff into this department as i have been asked by the member .
we will make sure that this is done by this department .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
the decentralization plan for the department is proceeding .
this is scheduled to begin in the year 2000 , as additional housing and office space becomes available .
speaking for my own community there is an abundance of staff housing and office space .
if the minister needs correspondence , i can make it available to their department , but i am sure that they have it .
there are two technical service positions slated for baker lake .
getting to that , i am also asking , is decentralized going to happen a bit quicker than next year in this department ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. mrazek .
mr. mrazek :
from the public works side there are two positions slated with information technology as the support staff for baker lake .
that is my understanding according to the organizational charts .
to be honest with you i am not sure if these things will happen between now and the next summer .
those positions are strictly depending on the decentralization of the other departments to the community , because those two positions will be supporting the network for other departments .
besides that there will be , or there will have to be , a training period when we have the outsourcing period with a contractor to train a number of people for those positions .
as far as baker i think we will probably have to wait a little while until decentralization is in progress .
otherwise those positions will not be able to support anything at this point in time .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
on that answer , i don &apos;t find it acceptable .
there is a training component in it , i have been in the office , in rankin inlet at public works and services there , and there &apos;s an abundance of staff there .
so i think by identifying and training a few unemployed inuit people from baker lake that this would probably fast track your positions in baker lake .
thank you .
thank you .
at this time the clock is running could you please make your questions and comments concise and understandable ?
mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i would like to ask this question in respect to petroleum products .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
ms. thompson or mr. mrazek .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
sustainable development would probably have something for subsidizing skidoo fuel .
but we would be reviewing the cost of fuel in the near future , so the members &apos; are invited to put in their comments at that time .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
is that all ?
mr. tootoo could you make your question concise and understandable please ?
mr. tootoo :
honourable members , mr. chairman , i am trying to think how to say it really quick .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
yes we are .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairperson .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson :
mr. mrazek .
mr. mrazek :
most housing associations are developed to the point that they are able to provide this type of building activity .
some of them are more developed than others , but it &apos;s individual cases , because it &apos;s supporting local community , we always look into that first before the decision is made .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. mrazek .
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
i would hope that it would happen within the baffin , i know over the last 2 years all the lho &apos;s had delivered all the capital .
i &apos;m wondering will that be still the case and continuing along with that type of service and more of an advisory and support role .
thank you mr. chairman .

mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i have few more short questions , is your department responsible for setting the rents , the staff will be paying for all the staff housing units .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. mrazek .
mr. mrazek :
it &apos;s not exactly public works responsibility it &apos;s joint responsibility mainly it is the department human resources and some advise from public works as far as the technical qualifications are concerned .
thank you mr. chairman
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. mrazek .
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
does your department , would they have an idea as i understand your department covers off all the lease costs related to staff housing .
we have to know what rents are going to be charged in order to know the effect and therefore , determine the levels of subsidies that are provided to staff for staff housing .
i &apos;m wondering if the ministers &apos; staff can provide us with information on what those subsidies are for the various staff housing units .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. mrazek .
mr. mrazek :
thank you mr. chairman .
but that &apos;s a very general rule .
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. mrazek .
i told you that you would have a last question , these people still have not made a comment .
mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i would like to ask a question in regards to petroleum products .
i was wondering if you department can find ways if to get aviation fuel in pelly bay .
that &apos;s my first question , to find out if we can get aviation fuel , how can we get aviation fuel in our community .
thank you .
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. chairman
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. thompson .
mr. alakannuark , i think mr. puqiqnak would like to make a comment now because he has been writing notes to me .
mr. puqiqnak .
mr.puqiqnak : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
first of all i would like to apologize to my colleague and to her department , although i stated earlier that i was a little upset .
as i had stated that , i don &apos;t want to take part in your meeting , but i would like to apologize to you as a member of the legislative assembly .
i have to represent my community and i hope that we will be working closely together in the future .
if the minister can respond to me and perhaps clarify to us after , i think that it would &apos;ve been better had i known about it .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. puqiqnak . ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
tomorrow morning i &apos;ll meet with you at 11 : 00 .
i will go ahead and meet with you , i didn &apos;t think you wanted to take part , but we &apos;ll continue meeting with you .
i received a letter from mr. puqiqnak , quite a lengthy letter .
i cannot tell you that i will be compensating for the snowmobiles but as i have stated to you earlier , we will look into it and we will deal with that .
so , based on that i can &apos;t do anything about the skidoos , because i am not sure that it was the fuel that caused them .
anyway in the future i am not prepared to help out with the skidoos . thank you very much .
chairperson : mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
now that we will meet with you tomorrow , i will expect better answers then .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
thank you for giving me a copy of your opening comment , for it gave me better information here .
your main estimates for the department are divided , 67.1 million dollars for o &amp; m and 5.7 for capital .
in regards to article 24 , there is quite a bit of dollars to be contracted out accordance to article 24 .
article 24 states that only if the company is 51 % inuit owned they would be the first priority to get the contract .
are you using article 24 .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
in regards to your question , article 24 , we will have to do things in accordance with article 24 .
our department is now looking at bip and article 24 .
it seems like article 24 was not acknowledged by our previous government because there were more than one aboriginal in that area .
i would like to get your input but at this time we are at our initial stage .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you for giving me a very clear response .

mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairperson .
mr. chairman in the ministers remarks she has indicated that we will spend a budget of 67.1 million dollars for o &amp; m.
i just note that a large part of this o &amp; m is under asset management and is approximately 42 million dollars but there is no detail .
i wonder if the minister and her staff could provide some detail as to what this 42 million dollars is for ?
it is not contained in the budget book .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i am sorry we don &apos;t have the detail in front of us right now , but the finance person here might be able to give us an idea what the question is .
we can certainly provide it in detail on paper at a later date if you want .
i will ask my finance person here to provide as much detail as he can from what he has .
thank you mr. chairperson .
mr. galbraith : .... ( inaudible comments ) ... million dollars and the other o &amp; m consists of 50 million dollars .
that line includes the lease payments , o &amp; m for the maintenance of the buildings , a multitude of activities that we perform .
i don &apos;t know how much detail you wanted but i could definitely provide that to you at a later date .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. chairman .
we &apos;re talking about $ 47 million .
i think it &apos;s important that we have an opportunity to see this otherwise , it wouldn &apos;t be prudent for us to pass such a large amount of money without knowing the details .
thank you .
chairperson :
( interpretation ) the finance controller would like to respond .
go ahead mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
i just wanted to him to give me some clarification , because it just seems like you &apos;re into the budget detail now .
because we haven &apos;t gotten into the page by page yet that , mr. chairman , is the point i was trying to make .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
since your information is on the main estimates , go ahead .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. chairman .
i &apos;m referring to the opening remarks made by the minister . it does indicate $ 67.1 million .
so , really what i &apos;m questioning is , it &apos;s a question relating to opening remarks .
i don &apos;t see the details in the budget , period .
but if that information is available going page by page well that &apos;s fine if we can have it before we conclude this department .
i &apos;m more than pleased to agree with that .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson :
thank you , mr. chairperson .
it seems like the finance person here has dug out the information .
he can just read the list down if the member wishes to hear that .
( interpretation ) the finance person can go down the list with details .
can he go ahead with those ?
they &apos;re not very long .
if it &apos;s okay with you mr. chairman .
mr. o &apos;brien :
if the department has those details that &apos;s fine .
we can wait until the page by page and hear what the details are then .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
so , are you done ?
no more question ?
mr. tootoo .
let me first ask if ms. thompson , are you going to ask for comments from the person beside you ?
what we usually do is that you have to ask general comments and then we go into the detail page by page .
and , i think that some of the questions that are being asked will be fitting into the page by page and then we can add in the amounts that we were talking about .
thank you .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. chairman .
just want to go back to the earlier comment made by mr. mrazek in regards to inquiring whether we wouldn &apos;t mind seeing information written .
i would love to see that .
then i would just ask for some kind of timeline when to expect that information .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. mrazek .
mr. mrazek :
if you &apos;re referring to the rent scale , as far as the individual housing are concerned we can provide that within one weeks time .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. chairman .
will that include the lease cost , the rent charged to the unit that the tenant would have to pay and the subsidy that the nunavut government is paying ?
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
go ahead .
mr. mrazek :
i can provide that to you within one weeks time .
in the case of the other region it &apos;s probably a little bit longer but you know no problem there .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo .
since there are no more people willing or wanting to ask questions or comments .
so , back to the main estimates .
do you have a copy .
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. chairman .
the two people beside my witnesses don &apos;t have a copy of the main estimates .
you can just go ahead , our financial officer doesn &apos;t have one .
so , if there was a spare copy , he &apos;s got it already .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
are you going to be reading ?
okay , do you want to go ahead with detail ?
good .
who has bifocals , cause i can &apos;t see up close .
i &apos;m farsighted .
i left my reading glasses at my hotel .
i &apos;m sorry .
too strong .
maybe those are better .
okay , page 644 .
if you look at that page .
those glasses are very good , we have same eyesight .

information item .
public service revolving fund .
information item .
mr. o &apos;brien.mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairperson . in reference to the petroleum products revolving fund .
we have an authorized limit of 60 million dollars , the expenditures are at 39.807 .
thank you.chairperson :
galbraith.mr. galbraith :
thank you mr. chairperson .
the revolving fund is set up separately from public works as all revolving funds are .
i guess the best way to put it is that it is basically a separate balance sheet altogether and it doesn &apos;t play into the regular expenditures of the government .
the authorized limit here of 60 million was taken from all of the gnwt for last year , and it could be cut down considerably .
but that is the authorized limit .
their supplying the service of providing fuel to the communities , so their expenditures are to try to equal the sales .
thank you mr. chairperson.chairperson :
mr. o &apos;brien.mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairperson .
mr. chairman , in view of the time we will soon have to make a decision as to whether to extend our hours to conclude this department .
or we would have to make a motion to report progress .
i certainly don &apos;t want to make that on behalf of the members , so we should get consensus as to what the wish is before we run out of time.chairperson :
mr. o &apos;brien.mr. o &apos;brien :
mr. chairman , i would like to move that we extend the hours to conclude this item.some members :

is that the case ?

you don &apos;t have to agree to that .
okay . 6.12 granular program revolving fund , information item . 6.13 detail of work performed on behalf of third parties .
information item .
mr. tootoo.mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i had a question on the granular program revolving fund .
unfortunately i didn &apos;t get recognized in time before you switched over .
i would ask to go back and ask a short little question in regards to the granular program revolving fund .
thank you mr. chairperson.chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo is requesting to go back to the granular program revolving fund .
are there any nays ?
since i don &apos;t hear any nays , you may go ahead mr. tootoo .
try to put your hand up high when you want to speak so we can see you .
mr. tootoo.mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i &apos;m only so tall but i will try better .
mr. chairman just again , just a question for clarification .
is this amount again another amount that was derived from last year &apos;s gnwt budget ?
if so , if it was not , that is my first point on that question , if you could answer that .
thank you mr. chairperson.chairperson :
mr. galbraith.mr. galbraith :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i want you to understand that the department of public works really didn &apos;t have a finance division set up at headquarters and the regional office , we weren &apos;t much involved in this .
well we were involved in the sense that we were consulted by the department of finance in putting this budget together .
to answer your question , yes this is a gnwt number coming from last year &apos;s main estimates .
the number , more theoretically here , in nunavut is more to the 4 - 6 million range.chairperson :
mr. tootoo.mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairperson .
thank you mr. tootoo .
ms. thompson.hon. manitok thompson :
thank you mr. chairperson , the second comment , i think the last comment he made was just a comment not a question.chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
is that all ?
mr. o &apos;brien.mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i ask for your indulgence .
i was concentrating on the petroleum products revolving fund when i asked the question as to whether we should report progress or continue .
once we made that agreement , i didn &apos;t get a chance to finish my question .
i wonder if i could go back for one question regarding the petroleum products revolving fund and the 60 million dollars that &apos;s identified in the budget ? chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i believe this has to be approved .
are you asking us to agree ?
mr. o &apos;brien.mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairperson .
as i &apos;ve indicated the authorized limit is 60 million dollars in the revolving fund .
this i believe is also a gnwt figure .
so is this representing , at the time , the total fund for the gnwt and for nunavut ?
if it is then this fund should be much greatly reduced and probably cut in half , if that is my understanding .
what is a realistic number , because this is what the budget is now , so what actually is a closer number that would represent nunavut ? chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. galbraith.mr. galbraith :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i am not all exactly sure what the authorized limit actually means .
mr. o &apos;brien.mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairperson .
one final question and a point of clarification .
if this figure is not accurate and we &apos;re being asked to pass this budget and the figure is not accurate ... what figure would more closely reflect the nunavut situation ? chairperson :
ms. thompson.hon. manitok thompson :
thank you mr. chairperson .
mr. chairman , we are just borrowing mr. galbraith from the regional office , he is not a headquarters person , we are just borrowing him from the region .
he is doing us a favour by being here , so just be patient and bear with us .
when i became the minister of the department we just had three staff , that was the dm , the adm and another adm or a secretary .
my apologies , thank you.chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. galbraith , if you could perhaps clarify the figure ? mr. galbraith :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i just want to emphasize that the authorized limit is the upset limit so to speak .
it is an arbitrary number , they tried to get it as accurate as possible , but this number included the west .
thank you mr. chairperson.chairperson ( interpretation ) :
did you get the clarification you wanted mr. o &apos;brien ?
mr. o &apos;brien.mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairperson .
mr. chairman maybe i am not as informed on this issue as i should be .
i don &apos;t want to cause any confusion or embarrassment to the minister or her staff and i realize that they are a very new department and so on .
but i think what i am trying to do is just get this straight in my mind , and in the other members that are here , in their mind .
this is , i think , a very significant barrier , we are talking about a large number of dollars here .
i will ask a question , maybe mr. mrazek , because i know he has been around for quite a while , he may be able to shed some more light on this .
if for example , the authorized limit is 60 million dollars , if that weren &apos;t utilized , could that money be used for something else ?
thank you.chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. mrazek.mr. mrazek :
as mr. galbraith said , basically the money is not really in the budget from that standpoint .
it is a maximum limit to which petroleum products can buy fuel or any other thing .
they cannot go anything over that , but they always stay below.chairperson ( interpretation ) :
madame minister , perhaps you could shed more light on the matter.hon. manitok thompson :
thank you mr. chairperson .
what you are approving is the two numbers and those are the numbers that make sense .
these are main estimates , what we would think that we would be spending , but as mr. mrazek has just indicated , this is not the actual number , it goes below that .
what you are approving is 39 million , 807 thousand , if you are wanting to approve it .
thank you mr. chairperson.chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. o &apos;brien.mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairperson .
please bear with me .
i am just trying to sort out more details about the revolving fund itself .
can the revolving fund be used , for example , to construct a capital project ?
can the revolving fund be used for anything other than petroleum products ?
it strictly deals with the purchase of petroleum products .
is that correct ? chairperson ( interpretation ) :
ms. thompson.hon. manitok thompson :
thank you mr. chairperson , i know mr. ng would really like to answer that but i will answer it for him anyway .
this is strictly for petroleum products , thank you.chairperson :
mr. tootoo.mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairperson .
so there is no actual cash involved from any other sources within government dollars .
is that a simpler way to explain it ?
thank you mr. chairperson.chairperson :
mr. galbraith .
ms. thompson.hon. manitok thompson :
thank you mr. chairperson , i might refer this to the finance minister .
he wasn &apos;t listening , was he .
did you get the question ?
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson : minister ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairperson .
this isn &apos;t an approval item , this is actually an information item that we are debating here .
so i don &apos;t know if that clarifies it , it is supposed to be revenue neutral , whatever you bring in it goes back out in expenditures and inventory .
thank you.chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i believe that question was answered .
mr. anawak , i believe you wanted to make a comment or question ? hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
not to the matter , i just wanted to tell ms. thompson , in respect to the granular program revolving fund , i know that they stockpile in some communities .
i have noted twice in broughton , clyde river and rankin inlet , that the granular materials usually have a written thing , &quot; this is owned by dpw , do not trespass &quot; .
i am just wondering about that.chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .

there are no more people i have written down for questions .
these are just information items on some of the details we have been talking about .
detail , work performed on behalf of third parties , the distribution of budget , i believe these are just informational items .
let &apos;s return to 6-3 , operations , detail of expenditures .
this is in respect to the details of expenditures , operations &amp; maintenance , total operations &amp; maintenance 67 million , 132 thousand dollars . are you agreed ?

importance of literacy , birthday
mr. mclean :

recognizing that our children are the future leaders of nunavut it is imperative to give them the tools leading to their success .

mr. speaker i &apos;m pleased and proud as the member from nanulik to extend my congratulations to the first graduates of the community teacher education program in coral harbour , who are graduating today .
these graduates have taken the first step to success and whether they go on to further study or go directly to the workplace they are the future of this new territory .
these graduates also will be the teachers of the future generations to come .
education is not accomplished alone and the support of others is essential , our culture is one of collaboration and connectedness .
we must continue to celebrate the sense of community and sharing .
education does not necessarily mean textbooks alone , it also includes the community and sharing culturally and i would like to congratulate these students on their success .

that is for the students in coral harbour .

item 6 :
oral questions
question 66 - 1 ( 2 ) :
allocation of staff housing
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question is for the minister responsible for staff housing , i believe the minister for human resources .
mr. speaker i &apos;m wondering if the minister could inform us as to whether this staff housing is for all government employees or is there a distinction between headquarters and regional staff .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. ng
hon. kelvin ng :

mr. ng
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i believe i indicated that we inherited both mechanisms and both policies for allocations .
so right now one of the issues , quite frankly , is how do you deal with that ?
do you pull them together and if that were the case , for example , you have dedicated headquarters positions that are targeted for headquarter staffing .
so those are the kinds of issues , as i have indicated , that have to be addressed .
it has to be looked at and explored in some form of these .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
do they have to be stuck in those accommodations , while we have existing units that are sitting empty and i believe we &apos;re paying for them .

hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
you will be handed out the notes for my opening comments .
mr. chairman and honourable members of the legislative assembly , i am pleased to present to you the 1999 / 2000 main estimates for the department of justice .
i think i will be introducing the officials later . remind me if i forget .
the justice system is important to each one of us .
the business plan , which we wish to undertake , outlines critical issues facing the department of justice . we face serious challenges .
the answers will not be easy .
the business plan and the budget for the department of justice does not include funding for new initiatives , other than the establishment of the nunavut court of justice .
in this initial year , we will be assessing the expenditures of the department , and determining first if there are any funds that can be re-allocated within existing allocations .
we believe that long term solutions will only be reached through working with communities , or better yet , giving communities the authority to deal with problems themselves .
we recognize that in order for this to happen , we will need to provide more support , including funding to communities in the future .
the responsibility to support communities in providing healing , training , and crime prevention will also require us to work closely with other departments of the nunavut government ;
culture language elders and youth as an example , health and social services , education , and my other portfolio , community government , housing and transportation .
several of our programs are contracted back to the gnwt for this transitional year .
we will be working hard to get the staff and infrastructure in place to establish the full range of programs here in nunavut by the end of the year .
we will be doing some important planning this year too .
for example , a corrections planning committee has been established to review corrections program and facility requirements and make recommendations .
this committee has representation from communities as well as from the corrections system and we expect them to consider new approaches to the way in which inmates are handled .
in cooperation with the department of justice for canada , the assistant deputy minister , rebecca williams has held meetings with community justice chairs from all the regions within nunavut .
the information and advice received from them will help guide the department in determining how to support further development of community justice capacity , as an alternative to the formal justice system within nunavut .
i also have to say that the delivery of probation services will continue to be done by social workers .
the social workers are paid through the department of health and social services .
this will continue . with regard to the law review process being requested by cabinet , additional funds will have to be found .
my department &apos;s budget would not cover this expenditure .
you will see in your materials that the budget for the department of justice is broken down into two main categories .
first , operations and maintenance and then the capital plan .
in your review of the main estimates , you will see on page 5-3 that our operations and maintenance budget totals $ 36,998.000.00 .
through the framework exercise our original budget requirement was reduced to the amount currently allocated .
the operations and maintenance part of the budget is broken down by these branches within the department :
directorate , law enforcement , legal services board , lawyer support services , registries and court services , as well as community justice and corrections directorate .
directorate :
this branch is responsible for the management and administration of the department .
law enforcement :
this refers to the contract with the r.c.m.p.
legal services board :
the boards are responsible for the delivery of legal aid services throughout nunavut .
lawyer support services :
departmental lawyers are responsible for example we have departmental lawyers in our department .
they will be providing the nunavut government with legal advice .
registries and court services :
community justice and corrections :
this branch is responsible for the operation of the baffin correctional centre here in iqaluit , and out post camps , as well as the funding for community justice committees .
as you can see , the department of justice has a very small capital budget totalling $ 313,000 .
approximately $ 300,000 is for security upgrades at the correctional centre here in iqaluit .
additional capital funding will be required in the future if we are going to repatriate our offenders from nwt institutions .
the department is waiting for recommendations from the corrections planning committee before identifying these future capital needs .
mr. chairman , this concludes the formal part of my presentation today .
we will be pleased to answer any questions you have about the budget for the department of justice .
i am also interested in comments you may have , or ideas about how we can work together to build a stronger justice system .
i would like to invite my officials mr. chairman ;
nora sanders , my deputy minister , and mike rudolph my financial advisor
thank you
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
you may step to the witness chair including your officials .
welcome all and thank you for giving us the opportunity .
the chair for the committee will read his committee report you may proceed to read .
mr. puqiqnak7 .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i will be reading so please do not , i will try not to put you to sleep so please bear with me .
in respect to the department of justice mr. chairman , i will be reading the report .
mr. anawak appeared before the committee on the morning of april 30th .
the main estimate summary provided to the committee indicated the total 1999 / 2000 in expenditures of $ 37,310,706 of which $ 313 , 000.00 is allotted to capital spending .
the committee was quite impressed with the level of detail provided during the ministers appearance .
the nunavut law review .
the minister stated that the cabinet had approved in principle a nunavut law review which would operate independently but they would have to report to the minister of justice .
this would be in consultation with the minister of culture , language , elders and youth .
the committee encouraged the minister to involve the elders in the work of the review to the fullest extent as possible .
mr. chairman we also want to speak to the single time zone for nunavut .
i believe they say that they use a different clock , they use a different one but we are speaking about the single time zone for nunavut .
the minister indicated that his department had undertaken a legal review of this initiative that was announced by the commissioner in her opening address to the assembly on april 1 / 1999 .
the minister also indicated that this might be accomplished in the spring or summer of this year .
the committee urged the minister to implement this change at the earliest opportunity
mr. chairman in respect to the gun registration .
the committee expressed a very strong concern in respect to unilingual inuit constituents have great difficulty associated with completing paperwork .
this has caused difficulties for the people associated with the federal government registration policies .
the minister indicated that in respect of the upcoming discussions with his federal counterpart , that the issue would be raised with a view to exploring solutions .
the committee would like an update on this issue as soon as new information becomes available to the department in respect to gun registration issues .
community justice .
the committee was very happy and applauded the ministers &apos; commitment to emphasizing the importance of progress in this field .
the committee noted the ministers &apos; caution that budgetary restraints have put pressure on the funds allocated for this area .
one member suggested that the communities should be responsible for dealing with summary offences .
for example , using summary offences that are not dangerous acts , the community justice committee should be able to deal with them .
mr. chairman the minister also indicated his desire to see a more uniform functioning of the community justice committees across nunavut .
just as an example , to ensure that offenders do not become repeat offenders .
the committee was supportive of the ministers &apos; goal to work with minister picco in pursuing the establishment of a probation system for the department .
corrections planning committee .
the minister provided an update on the activities of the newly formed corrections planning committee which would be meeting again in may .
one issue that the members of the committee raised was the possibility of a federal correctional facility being established in nunavut .
the minister indicated that the corrections planning committee would study the issue but that it was too soon to say yes to a joint facility .
members expressed their interest in seeing a correctional facility established in the kitikmeot and keewatin .
on the land outpost camps .
the committee expressed its &apos; desire to see the program accelerated .
the minister indicated that the program hadn &apos;t taken off as quickly as the department would have liked , but they would make efforts to do so if feasible .
the ministers &apos; deputy further noted that the corrections representatives had recently travelled to baker lake and arviat and would travel to kitikmeot in june .
security considerations were cited as being an obstacle to overnight success with respect to this issue .
that concludes the committee report mr. chairman , i would like to move a motion .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
go ahead .

are there any general questions to the directorate of the department of justice .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson . the standing committees &apos; reports on the main estimates .
in the committees &apos; report the figure is different .
i would like to ask the minister , that in his opening remarks his figures are totally different from the committee report and from the main estimates .
i would like to get a response as the figures in all three documents are different .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
the department &apos;s main estimates are 37 million , 311 thousand ; for capital expenditures 313 thousand .
part of the 313 thousand is for security upgrades at the correctional centre here in iqaluit .
i could get detailed information for the 313 thousand , but the main estimates figure is 37 million , 311 thousand , it did not change .
i just want to explain to you that the capital will be 313 thousand but the operations &amp; maintenance is 36 thousand 998 , mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu are you more clear now ?
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
yes , i see them now , thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
are there any other general comments ?
i don &apos;t have any people on my list , please raise your hands if you have any questions .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairperson .
just in regards to the gun control registration .
i wanted to ask the minister if that was a responsibility of his department or was the responsibility for that program under his federal counterparts department .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
the federal government &apos;s justice minister is responsible for gun registration .
therefore i couldn &apos;t get connected with her so we will have a meeting on june 7th .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i guess the administration of this program , as the minister indicated , falls under federal jurisdiction .
is the minister aware of how many employees the federal justice department has to administer this program in nunavut ?
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
gnwt did not want to take on this responsibility , so the federal government has this jurisdiction at this time .
gnwt had been asked to take on this responsibility but they did not want to take it on . we don &apos;t have any staff members so i would like to discuss this matter .
i tried to meet with ann mclellan but she had to go to alberta for a funeral as a student was shot in one of the schools .
at his time we don &apos;t have any staff members now but would like to get a staff member who is inuit and bilingual and could reflect inuit culture .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairperson .
the minister mentioned the gnwt , i wonder if he meant the government of nunavut , or the old gnwt , as far as taking on these programs .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
they asked the gnwt if they would take on this responsibility .
i have been trying to get together with the minister so we can look at means and ways of dealing with gun registration in nunavut .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
please recognize the chair before you make your comments .
thank you .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairperson .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
that is what i have been trying to say for a long time .
i have been trying to get in touch with the minister and i know the concerns very well as i am a hunter myself .
i know exactly where the rest of the hunters of nunavut are coming from .
i think we should be able to do that without spending any money from nunavut .
we have tried to set up meetings .
we did have two tentative meetings which were cancelled and there is another one set up for june 7 , i believe .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
is that an adequate response mr. tootoo ?
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairperson .
mr. chairman the minister spoke about the use of traditional counselling , land camps and so on and i think that everyone here is in support of that , strongly .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you . as i said earlier , there is a committee struck to deal with the setting up of such a structure .
rebecca williams can talk about it in detail because she works with that committee .
they are considering , and talking with the department of justice at the federal level , about setting up some type of facility in the nunavut area .
rebecca williams and i went to fenbrook which is a federal penitentiary .
i can &apos;t say it was a nice tour , but the facility is situated in a southern province .
we are going to work very hard to see if we can house those inmates up here and we are going to keep looking for money .
for the serious crimes we are going to keep sending the inmates down south .
chairperson :
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
just for a point of clarification mr. chairman .
can you clarify that , thank you .
chairperson :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
mr. chairman .
( interpretation ends ) there is a possibility of getting some funding to get a correctional facility up here which would probably focus at the beginning on the more medium security type inmates .
chairperson :
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairperson .
thank you mr. anawak , that answered my question .
i thought it was a little too harsh using the word murderers , but what i was referring to was the more serious crimes but not to that degree .
more or less an expansion of what we have now for example in the baffin and over in yk .
my second comment or question is in reference to law reform .
you have indicated that you are going to involve elders in this review .
what role do you see for the members that sit on the standing committee on justice .
what role do you see these members playing in this review .
chairperson :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak :
mr. chairman at this point in time we are having discussions with culture , language , elders &amp; youth on the law review .
i mean if we are going to move forward we want to move forward with regular members .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
for further clarification i would like to know how many judges there are in nunavut .
how many judges are there that work on the circuit in the nunavut area .
chairperson :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
maybe ms. sanders could respond to that question . chairperson :
ms. sanders .
ms. sanders : two judges have been appointed .
the senior judge , judge brown , is already sitting here . the second judge , judge kilpatrick , will be coming in june .
he was sworn in on april 1st , but has not yet started .
hopefully by this time next year there will be a third judge appointed and those three judges will serve all of nunavut .
so right now , 2 and there will be 3 .
at times we also have deputy judges , or judges from other jurisdictions that come for a week or two , to help out or to do a circuit , that sort of thing .
that can be where there is a conflict or where the work load gets too heavy .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. sanders .
we heard both the inuktitut and the english on one channel .
could we have the technician fix that problem please ?
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
the reason why i asked that question is just because you don &apos;t have enough judges , you defer some of the sittings .
for example they set appointments for when they &apos;re going to be sitting and they keep deferring the date from one date to the next and possibly three-four times .
is there a good reason ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , puqiqnak .
mr. anawak ?
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
ms. sanders will make a supplementary to my remarks .
what we did was set up one court system when we became nunavut because it seems that it takes a longer time when you have different levels .
possibly , ms. sanders could make a supplementary comment .
chairperson :
ms. sanders ?
ms. sanders :
i think the minister &apos;s already said the important things .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
any further questions ?
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. chairman .
we &apos;re going to be responsible for the operations and maintenance , and because of that , i will not be able to support the building of such facilities .
the correctional ... if we &apos;re looking at the correctional centres in the nunavut area , we &apos;re just going to be using money instead of helping our people .
we have to think like that in the future .
if we &apos;re going to be building correctional centres , and jails , and so on , it &apos;s just going to be eating our money without helping the people .
with that in mind , the nunavut government should seriously look into preventative and educational programs .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. anawak ?
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
i ... we would be very glad to start such programs if we didn &apos;t need correctional centres or jails .
i truly support the idea of setting up such programs , but of course there &apos;s always going to be people in correctional facilities .
there &apos;s some in fenbrook , and some in bowden , and some in yellowknife .
we are putting our money into those facilities every day and we pay the ontario government , we pay the alberta government , and the government of the northwest territories for housing these inmates .
of course we truly support preventative methods , and educational programs if we can find money to pay for such programs .
but looking at the number of people that are in the southern penitentiaries , i don &apos;t believe that the numbers are going to decrease .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. iqaqrialu ?
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
there &apos;s not much we can do in that area but i think we have to work together .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. anawak ?
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
regarding the comments that were just made by the member .
i know that ... i think there &apos;s a concern in all of the communities . people often feel that someone who hasn &apos;t offended seriously should not have been sent away .
that &apos;s why we want to see local people dealing with these issues especially when they are jps dealing with people that they know and who come from the community .
what is your problem ?
what can we do to help you ? &quot;
but that step is not part of the present administration of justice , so we want to promote those kinds of things and we &apos;re working on getting those kinds of programs in place .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. anawak .
are you finished ?
yes , i understand what you are saying and i think that you all understand the same thing but you &apos;re just in different stages of trying to reach your goal .
mr. alakannuark ?
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. chairman .
i have a question that i would like to ask regarding the role of the elders and it &apos;s one of the goals of the department to involve elders in their programs .
now , in which way are you going to involve the elders ?
is that going to be at the local level , or are you going to get the elders together to decide on the goals and objectives of the department ?
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. anawak ?
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
yes , thank you .
i think we also have to be aware that not only the elders have to be involved .
we will have to involve the young people as well , because i think we all know that they have different things to contribute .
we have different understandings and different issues in various stages of life . when we say adults we &apos;re thinking about elders , those people who are older than us , not just adults .
i just want you to be aware of that .
the elders are much more involved in justice issues , especially in the area of justice committees in smaller communities .
when we &apos;re talking about the department of justice , i know you &apos;re asking about that .
i think that the nunavut government is going to be using the elders in their programs .
we &apos;re trying to institute the inuit traditional knowledge , or inuit qaujimajituqangit .
this is going to be one of the first priorities in how we can involve the elders and other people in the communities .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. alakannuark ?
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. chairman .
yes , i understand what you are saying .
we will need jails in the future as well as now .
we have a traditional system of justice and our forefathers did not use jails .
that has not worked .
i think sometimes people are sent away to jail , like to penitentiaries when it would not have been necessary .
even people who are still in denial of having committed a crime are convicted in court and is sent away to heal .
presently , the people who have been sent away to correctional centres and jails have not seen a healing process .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
minister anawak ?
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
yes , thank you , mr. chairman .
i &apos;m sorry i forgot to mention that .
that is another area that we &apos;re seriously looking at . we need to have on the land programs where people can go to as an alternative to jails .
if we &apos;re going to institute a traditional form of justice , i think we can be looking at that .
if we change everything right away , it might not be a good thing for everybody .
that &apos;s why we want to review this first and try and institute the inuit way of dealing with offenders .
thank you , mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. anawak .
tootoo ?
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , just a question for the minister .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. anawak ?
hon. jack anawak :
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. chairman .
i was just wondering if his department is doing any preliminary work to see whether it &apos;s something that is winnable or is not worth
looking at . i was just wondering that , mr. chairman .
thank you .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
chairperson :
tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. chairman .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
anawak ?
hon. jack anawak :
there has to be an understanding that the gun control challenge , has nothing to do with hunting rights .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. chairman .
i don &apos;t mean to get going on this , but he still hasn &apos;t answered whether there would be grounds to pursue it or not ?
that &apos;s quite simple .
thank you , mr. chairman .
hon. jack anawak :
one part of canada is not challenging the bill . it &apos;s a judgement call more than anything else .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
tootoo ?
i think it &apos;ll be your last question , mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. chairman .
i guess then ... in that case and as the minister mentioned it , it &apos;s up to what you consider grounds .
is it not the justice department &apos;s mandate to provide advice to the government on such matters ?
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. anawak ?
hon. jack anawak :
again , my advice is that we don &apos;t have to expend the 400 thousand dollars .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i would like to give a chance to those members who did not have a chance to ask their questions or comments .
mr. nutarak did you want to make a comment ?
no ?
mr. akesuk ?
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
the nunavut government has contracts , does the nunavut government contract out to the gnwt for the department of justice ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. anawak ?
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
yes we do have a contract with gnwt .
perhaps ms. sanders can give you the information .
chairperson : ms. sanders .
ms. sanders : we have a number of programs contracted back for this current fiscal year .
mr. akesuk . mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
could you tell us what you are paying for those services .
nakurmik .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
who would like to respond first ?
maybe the person who finds the document first .
ms sanders ?
ms. sanders :
i am just trying to see if we have a total for all of the programs .
do you have it there mike ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
are you finished mr. akesuk ?
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i want to get back to the gun bill .
i understand what mr. tootoo is saying and we know that there is a lot of concern out there regarding the bill .
i know in my community there have been many comments and concerns raised .
i guess the train is already heading down the track and somebody else is paying for the gas we should just look forward to it getting to it &apos;s destination .
my concern right now is the problem we have in the meantime in people trying to get their guns registered .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
who would like to respond ?
hon. jack anawak :
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
do you have anything further mr. o &apos;brien ?
mr. o &apos;brien :
no that &apos;s all i have to say at this point .
mr. chairman i wonder if it is time to move on to line by line .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
if there are no further comments , yes we can go line by line .
are there any comments ?
just in case we adjourn early i would like to take a ten minute break .
&gt; &gt; committee recesses for ten minutes
chairperson ( interpretation ) :

hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
for information purposes for mr. akesuk the contracts that we have total $ 3,983,563 . these are the contracts that we have .
i apologize for something i said earlier . we are not paying for the federal inmates .
it is the federal government that pays for the services .
i thought we were paying for the whole justice services , but for the federal legislation , we are not paying for any federal. inmates .
oh i am sorry , when i was talking about the amount of money we were spending on the inmates , i may have inadvertently said something wrong here .
regarding the federal inmates , the government of nunavut is not putting any money into the federal inmates .
that is paid for by the government of canada .
i just wanted to clarify that .
( interpretation ) mr. chairman if it is ok with you i would like to recognize two people who are here .
i would like to acknowledge nicole campaugh .
she was from rankin inlet but she moved to yellowknife and another person who is here from rankin inlet , mayor of rankin inlet , simon okpatauyak .

thank you mr. chairman .
in the middle one under grants and contributions - $ 510,000.00 . i would like to get further clarification on what that is for .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
minister anawak ?
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) : yes .
this $ 510,000.00 is for the communities .
it is the community justice program .
perhaps i will talk a little bit about that issue .
in baffin region $ 215,000.00 .
kitikmeot $ 94,000.00 and keewatin $ 13,000.00 total , $ 440,500.00 .
but the difference , the remaining funds could be used for victim assistance programs .
this $ 440,500.00 will be used for community justice programs but the remainder will be for the victims ;
$ 60.000.00 .
is that clear now ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu if you could look at the last page .
in the details of grants and contributions there is detailed information here .
do you have any further questions ?
which page are you on ? 5-11 , details of grants and contributions . page 5-11 .
the detailed information is in that page .
contributions for community justice initiatives .
mr. iqaqrialu . mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. chairman . chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you . minister anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
regarding the $ 440,000.00 that is geared towards community justice programs , if there was a surplus from that program , we would not take it back .
they would keep it .
but i could give you detailed information as to what is allowed to the communities on these funds that are allotted to community justice programs .
perhaps , i apologize , i would like ms. sanders to explain this .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
go ahead ms. sanders .
ms. sanders ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
( interpretation ends ) each of the community contributions to the justice committees that we have allocated this year are the same as they received last year .
we are also negotiating today and tomorrow with justice canada to see if they will match that funding .
that is not a definite thing yet but we are quite optimistic about that .
so that would increase the amount for each community .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
in view of these court system changes perhaps we are now trying to give more responsibility to the community justice committees .
although this fund is now $ 440,500.00 if it is possible to get additional funding from the federal government we will work harder to get the amount larger next year .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
the community justice committees , i don &apos;t know if they are paid honoraria when they deal with these issues . if this includes the jp &apos;s .
i don &apos;t know if the jp &apos;s get honoraria or if they are paid .
i think everyone has to have a clear understanding including myself and my constituency as to what kind of operations and maintenance they have for each community .
this is self explanatory but i don &apos;t know especially in our community if we have a justice program in our community so i will look into it .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
yes , in regards to mr. iqaqrialus &apos; comment it would be easier to understand if it was that way .
tootoo ?
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i just wanted to get clarification on that ?
hon. jack anawak : the budget for offenders held in the nwt is ;
adult male offenders , $ 4,281,000.00 .
female offenders $ 241,000.00 , and
young offenders , $ 603,000.00 for a
total of $ 5 , 125,000.00 in terms of spending on all the offenders based in the nwt ,
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman i wonder if the amount allocated in the budget takes into consideration the fee that we get charged from the government of the northwest territories only in that area .
i was wondering if that is what is budgeted in there .
thank you mr. chairman .
ms. sanders :
these budget amounts are not all being paid to the gnwt . we are not committed to paying those to the nwt .
but at any given time we may have as many offenders there as we have here because of the lack of capacity to be here .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i was wondering if that was something that was added on to after or if it has indeed been something that was overlooked .
thank you mr. chairman .
ms. sanders ( interpretation ) : thank you mr. chairman .
( interpretation ends ) apparently those calculations were estimated as part of the budgets for the corrections facility here .
that is where the transportation costs for the inmates were included and we are hoping that they will be adequate .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
is that all ?

the total operations and maintenance is $ 12,926,000.00 .

ministers &apos; statements
ministers &apos; statement 14 - 1 ( 2 ) :
nunavut governments &apos; commitment to elders
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i want to share with you our departments &apos; commitment to help our elders in nunavut .
elders are a very special group of people in our inuit society .
our culture is a verbal one .
we never had a writing system .
our knowledge about our culture and language is passed on through generations of inuit , thousands of years ago .
our elders are a walking history .
their knowledge is filled with inuktitut and inuinnaqtun words that are unknown to our younger society .
they are passed on to us through legends , spirituality , shamanism , and inuit traditional songs or phihiit .
the inuit ways must not be allowed to disappear .
uqartii , we must always remember the fact that , it is because of our elders that we are here today .
uqartii , in november 1998 , we gathered 26 elders and 26 youth in iqaluktuuttiaq ( cambridge bay ) for the first time in our nunavut history .
if there was one thing we &apos;ve established out of this important conference , it was better communication between our elders and youth .
that is the way is used to be and that is what it must be today and in the future .
our government is committed to continue this dialogue between these two groups .
our department is committed to continue these annual conferences .
we must place a high priority to our elders .
mr. speaker , each time an elder dies , he or she takes with them a whole lot of knowledge about inuit / inuinnaqtun culture and language .
it is urgent that all of us in nunavut begin to utilize these people .
we need their help .
our government is committed to looking what ways of how we can better utilize our elders .
uqartii , i have asked my department to look into the possibility of establishing this important initiative .
i have asked my department to start to assembly and collect the oral history of our nunavut elders and resources which document the history of nunavut .
mr. speaker , much of this materials exists in different locations across the country and it is time to bring it home .
doing this is not a luxury - it is something we must do .
uqartii , i believe and i trust the members here will all share this belief - that our history and our culture is what makes us strong .
it is what must be taught to our youth by elders and in the education system , if our youth are to be proud , knowledgeable and informed about where we have come from .
in this fashion , they will have a clearer vision of where we need to go .
uqartii , ahiitlu katimamajiuqatitka , i am proud to recognize the importance of my department recording and developing the cultural and historical record on which our nunavut territory is based .
let me be heard by the population of nunavut , that our government is committed to work towards a betterment of our elders .
we must make sure that we start to utilize them in promoting inuit qaujimajatunqangit .
that is the way it should be .
quana , uqartii .

item 3 :
members &apos; statements
members &apos; statement 49 - 1 ( 2 ) : importance of decentralized government
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker for over 25 years the people of the eastern arctic have been planning and working toward the realization of having their own government .
the dream of nunavut holds many promises and benefits for its people .
mr. speaker for twenty some years the power of control rested far away from small nunavut communities .
that power base was yellowknife and thus one of the reasons for this new government of nunavut , a government closer to the people .
mr. speaker this brings me to my main point .
the people in the smaller , less fortunate hamlets of nunavut have been promised a decentralized government .
a government closer to the people .
mr. speaker a decision not to have a decentralized government would be unfair , misleading and would create doubt in the real meaning of nunavut .
finally , mr. speaker , some people in this government may say we cannot afford a decentralized government .
mr. speaker , i say we cannot afford not to have a decentralized government .
thank you mr. speaker .

disorders of the day , may 20
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , traditionally fridays members make statements of a lighter or more humorous note .
i am not able to do that today , as i have to speak to the serious concern that occurred yesterday in this house .
after several days of practice , rehearsal and method acting training ...
a member : ... didn &apos;t work
&gt; &gt; laughter
hon. ed picco :
... i was able to pull off a totally realistic portrayal of a minister mistaken in the orders of the day .
&gt; &gt; laughter
mr. speaker i will be picking up the oscar on the break later today and i invite the members to attend with me .
thank you .

payroll deductions , nunavut teachers and staff
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
as we are a new government we are going to be asking a lot of questions about what we should be doing .
this was done by the government of the northwest territories , federal government before nunavut became a reality .
members &apos; statement 52 - 1 ( 2 ) :
congratulations on success of session
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
yes , thank you .
first i am very proud that this has been a very successful session of the legislative assembly this week .
i think that even though we have never really been involved in a legislative assembly , we should be proud of ourselves in the way we have conducted ourselves this week .
even though we did some stumbling , overall i think this week has been a good beginning and we should all be proud of ourselves in our success this week .

thank you mr. speaker .

i am very proud to say i am getting more comfortable and learning from the mistakes that we sometimes make .
i would like to reassure my colleagues that we are allowed to make mistakes and we can learn from them .
even when people say we are the opposition of the cabinet , we are all friends here .

apologies to constituents , safe journey to travelling members
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i stand up today to say that i envy the people that will be going home today .
when i was first elected i used to think that my home community is nearby and i would be able to go home from time to time , but that was a misperception .
also to my constituents in pangnirtung , i would like to apologize that i will not be able to go home on the weekend because of airline schedules .
for those members who will be travelling home today , have a safe journey home .

oral questions
question 67 - 1 ( 2 ) :
translation of legislation
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
this morning in caucus we were dealing with proposed bills .
i have a question for mr. ng .
if we are going to be proposing bills , i would suggest that all the proposed bills be in both inuktitut and english .
my problem was there were some things missing in inuktitut .
i would suggest that everything be properly translated , if they are going to be done into inuktitut .
that is for a clarification .
speaker :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i don &apos;t know if there was a question there but i would like to respond .
the government is cognizant of the fact that legislation must be understood before we pass legislation .
i think it is just the logistics right now , the logistics and the significant expertise to actually draft legislation and whether that is able to be done in syllabics in its &apos; entirety .
thank you .

mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :

another question to minister of responsible for staff housing , he &apos;s mentioned over the last couple of days that his department is working on a new policy for staff housing .
i &apos;m just wondering mr. speaker if you could provide us with time frame for when we can expect to have a new comprehensive policy for staff housing .

oral questions mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu :
( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker , this question is for the minister of public works .
when we were still under the government of the nwt some of the staff housing were sold and bought privately , but these staff houses that were bought were not renovated .
are there any plans to renovate the existing staff houses , that were bought by the public .
it caused quite a concern and some of the people who bought these old staff houses , had some problems , because the houses that were bought were very old .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
the people who bought those houses knew that these houses were old .
once they bought them they are no longer our responsibility and they become the responsibility of the people who bought them .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker : ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. thompson .
oral questions , mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
when the old staff houses were put up for sale , they should have been renovated , before they were sold .
i don &apos;t know why they didn &apos;t do that and of course when they were bought , they were no longer the responsibility of the government .
if we sell old buildings , some of the people who buy these houses are not rich and it causes a problem , it caused a problem .
thank you mr. speaker , i would like this to be considered .
speaker : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister of public works , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
the staff housing that were put up for sale were very cheap .
when you are buying housing , you &apos;re talking about $ 250 thousand dollars to buy a house .
the staff housing we sold were going much cheaper .
we sold them as is .
if we &apos;re going to be renovating before we sell them , we &apos;re going to be using a lot more money out of our budget .
the people who bought those houses now own those and they are no longer our responsibility .
thank you mr. speaker .

item 19 : second reading of bills
bill 2 - boards of management dissolution act
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
i was looking forward to this .
mr. speaker i move , seconded by the member for pangnirtung , bill 2 , the boards of management dissolution act be read for the second time .
mr. speaker today i &apos;m introducing a piece of legislation entitled the boards of management dissolution act .
this legislation allows the government to ensure a smooth transition over the next year as we work with boards towards the new health and social services for the people of nunavut .
before i continue mr. speaker i would like to take this opportunity to commend the trustees of our health and social services boards for their service over the years .
the boards ensured that the people of nunavut played a role in their own affairs during the time as a minority in the northwest territories .
but this is a new territory and a new day , we have our own government now , and we as residents of nunavut are well represented by the 19 mlas in this house .
the decision to take a different approach in providing health and social services to nunavummiut , has been guided by two important principles .
first , we want to be accountable , we want to ensure that this government is responsible and responsive to the people of nunavut .
we want to bring this government closer to the people we all represent and work directly with all our communities .
second , we want to be efficient .
as we have already discussed publicly , estimates show that we will be able to re-direct significant monies , mr. speaker , into programs and services as a result of the impending decision .
in short , we want to ensure a nunavut based approach , taking advantage of what our communities have in common , while still taking into account their uniqueness .
i want to point out mr. speaker , phasing out the boards will not affect the day to day delivery of programs and services to our clients in nunavut .
the services provided by all health and social services workers in each region will continue to serve the public .
i would like to express my appreciation to all the health and social services care providers , administrative and support staff in our communities in nunavut .
these people are the heart for health and social services in nunavut .
we all rely on them and i want to promise them that over the coming year i will devote myself to ensuring a stable and smooth transition .
mr. speaker i have instructed my officials at the department that we will work collaboratively with the boards as we develop an implementation plan .
i &apos;ve also committed to the standing committee on culture , education and health , that they will have an implementation plan completed by september of this year .
mr. speaker , to adopt a new direction for health and social services in nunavut .

thank you mr. speaker .
i will be speaking in inuktitut , but your interpreters have a copy .
mr. speaker it gives me a great deal of pleasure to stand before you today to introduce this piece of legislation entitled divisional education councils dissolution act .
the school boards in nunavut now known as the divisional education councils were originally created to give the residents of the eastern arctic a voice in the government of the nwt .
the responsibility for the delivery of these services will now be transferred to the elected leaders of the people of nunavut .
all of us have a role in the important social function of educating our children .
mr. speaker , education is a fundamental and important to the success of nunavut and this piece of legislation is a first step in building our new future in nunavut .

weekend fire in iqaluit
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
as a result , 20 people are now homeless . thanks to the iqaluit fire department , we are fortunate that there were no serious injuries or loss of life .
fires such as this are always tragic events .
i want to extend my sympathy to those who lost their homes so suddenly over the weekend .
i want to assure them that i will be working with the iqaluit housing authority and my colleagues to find alternate accommodations as quickly as possible .

ministers &apos; statement 16 - 1 ( 2 ) :
decentralization
hon. paul okalik :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i rise today to make something very clear to the members of this house , and the people of nunavut .
mr. speaker , the nunavut government is firmly committed to decentralization .
our government was founded on the basis of bringing government closer to the people and make no mistake , mr. speaker , we will do just that .
we are proceeding with decentralization as we speak .
in arviat , the four employees of the department of education will soon be joined by twenty-three others .
currently , the department is in the process of advertising for these positions , which will come on stream once the office space is available over the coming months .
three staff from e department of community government , housing &amp; transportation are in place and two more will be out for competition shortly .
the department of sustainable development has moved the four regional positions that were scheduled to be transferred into this community .
mr. speaker , the residents of baker lake can rest assured that decentralization is moving ahead in their community .
the department of education will soon be hiring four additional staff to complement those already on the ground .
the department of community government , housing &amp; transportation currently has three of its baker lake positions out for competition and three more will be out before our next sitting .
in igloolik , the department of culture , language , elders &amp; youth has six employees , and they will soon be joined by approximately twenty more in the coming months .
in addition , one position from community government , housing &amp; transportation is out for competition .
further west , mr. speaker , cambridge bay has already begun to see the benefits of decentralization .
positions in the departments of human resources , and culture , language , elders &amp; youth have been staffed .
rankin inlet , mr. speaker , also has begun the staffing process .
employees in three departments are based there , including two of our assistant deputy ministers .
the department of health and social services is currently increasing its staffing level from nine to thirteen .
one person has been hired from community government , housing &amp; transportation to work in gjoa haven and five more positions are currently out to competition .
for kugluktuk , two positions from the department of community government , housing &amp; transportation are staffed and three more are out to competition and will be filled during the next few months .
all of the regional positions with the department of sustainable development except two have been moved into kugluktuk .
one position from cape dorset is out for competition right now and six more will be advertised within the coming two months .
mr. speaker , the communities of pond inlet and pangnirtung will soon be receiving jobs as they are transferred out of iqaluit .
this process will take place over a varied time frame , depending on departmental planning , and infrastructure .
these positions i have mentioned , mr. speaker , are just the beginning .
mr. speaker , the nunavut implementation commission and the office of the interim commissioner developed our basis for decentralization .
as decentralization is an important issue that affects all departments , the department of the executive has been assigned the difficult task of co-ordinating our decentralization efforts and ensuring that decentralization is implemented .
and , mr. speaker , this will be a difficult task .
we are setting out to decentralize in a manner that no government in canada has ever done .
we will decentralize , but we must ensure that our programs and services to people in nunavut are not adversely affected .
we must do this in a thoughtful , well planned manner that allows communities to prepare for the inevitable social impacts .
this , mr. speaker , takes time .
decentralization was never intended to take place overnight .
we as cabinet understand the importance of decentralization to our communities .
but , it is important to realize that not all pieces of the puzzle are in place .
our people are not fully trained to take many of the positions that will flow from decentralization .
in this house i mentioned that the department of the executive would be studying the options for implementing the decentralization plan .
regular mla &apos;s will be involved in this process .
mr. speaker , i thank those members who brought this issue to the forefront .
we as cabinet look forward to working with them to ensure that community concerns are properly addressed .
i am confident that if we all work together , we will do what is right for nunavut .
thank you mr. speaker .

weekend fire in iqaluit
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i would like to rise this afternoon to express my most sincere sympathies for the families who were so tragically rendered homeless on sunday in this community by a fire .
i am gratified for the ministers &apos; response to this tragedy , however , this unhappy incident clearly demonstrates that contingency plans need to be in place to deal with incidents such as these .
no one can predict when something like this will happen , and while we should all be grateful nobody was killed or seriously injured , the burden on these people is still tremendous .
those iqalummiutait who have opened their hearts and their homes to the victims deserve our greatest respect .

secondary school design for baker lake
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question is to the minister of education regarding the jonah amitnak secondary school in baker lake that was built 1957 and added to in the 60 &apos;s .
according to the current building codes , it is not worth renovating and it &apos;s not up to standards .
can the minister answer me as to why this project was scrapped this year .

speaker :
( interpretation ) : thank you mr. premier .
mr. o &apos;brien
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. speaker .
i thought we heard the premier of manitoba just last night on the radio indicating that he strongly supported the road linkage between manitoba and the keewatin , or nunavut .
can the premier tell me whether or not these discussions took place and in what degree .
thank you .
speaker :
( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
our premier mr. okalik .
hon. paul okalik :
i discussed it briefly with the premier of manitoba , he is a very strong supporter of a road to nunavut , but we did not get into detailed discussions .
speaker :
( interpretation ) : thank you mr. okalik .
third question mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. speaker .
they were basically put together to study a road linkage and power grid and the result is a study apparently finished sometime in march .
i wonder if the premier is aware of any of the conclusions or the decisions that were made upon the completion of the report .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
the question was directed to the premier , would you like to answer .

question 73 - 1 ( 2 ) :
government response to fire in iqaluit
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker this weekend , the public housing inventory in iqaluit took a six unit hit as a result of a fire .
the current waiting list is around 70 right now for public housing and as we just heard from the minister responsible for housing earlier , there are now 20 more people that are homeless .
i would like to ask the minister if there are any preliminary plans as a result of this prior to looking into replacing those units .
thank you mr. speaker .

oral questions , mr. puqiqnak .
question 74 - 1 ( 2 ) :
repatriation of artifacts
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question is for the minister of culture , language , elders and youth .
a lot of pictures have been taken since that time in the nunavut area and these artifacts are outside of canada and i believe that they should by rights be here in nunavut .
i believe that we must bring our artifacts and photographs , which have been taken many , many years ago , back .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
two questions .
mr. havioyak , minister of culture .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
yes i do understand your questions quite clearly and i do appreciate you very much for asking that question .
all of my employees and staff members are working on all these issues to get all our artifacts back and also the photographs that you are talking about that are in museums .
we all know that they are elsewhere and i know that we have to have a building in place first before we can start collecting these .
these are our major concern as well and all the people that i have spoken to are concerned about this matter .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. havioyak .
third question mr. puqiqnak .
second question ?
mr. puqiqnak :
mr. speaker today our new generation and our younger people want to know what is their culture , with their own eyes .
today older people talk about their culture by telling them a story .
just by talking .
our younger children , today &apos;s generation want to understand and they want to see their fathers .
without a museum in nunavut , mr. speaker it is going to be difficult for us and for the new generation .
will the minister tell us what his plans are to ensure that the young people in each community can see with their own eyes their history and culture .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
mr. havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
we are working on this museum that you are talking about .
as i stated before we are working together so that our younger generation will understand our history .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
supplementary question mr. puqiqnak ?
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
there is a demand out there and it won &apos;t be very much if we have to go to copenhagen to see our history , our culture and our clothing .
usually the people who are not from nunavut are the ones that are telling our history about the people of nunavut .
all the money is going to copenhagen instead of going up to the nunavut territory .
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
i believe he answered that question but if he would like to make a supplementary response , he is free to do so .
mr. havioyak ?
hon. donald havioyak :
many of these artifacts are all over the place and we know that they are not in nunavut .
they are somewhere else and we need to repatriate those back from the nwt , the rest of canada and even in copenhagen .
those are artifacts that we own and we , i think we are preparing to repatriate those back to nunavut .
today we are working at it at this time .

oral questions ?
mr. alakannuark .
question 75 - 1 ( 2 ) :
status of nurse recruitment
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
this is to the minister of health and social services about the nurses in the communities .
when are you going to be recruiting more nurses in the smaller communities .
many of the communities have only one nurse and sometimes there are two but when are you going to be up to par in the smaller communities for the recruitment of nurses ?
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
minister of health , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker the responsibility for the hiring and staffing of nurses right now is with the regional health boards .
indeed , mr. speaker the health boards are very active in trying to secure nurses for our communities .
from the departments point of view , we are working on the recruitment and retention program for our nursing staff .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. picco .
mr. alakannuark did you have a second question ?
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
the reason i am asking this question , and i think i understand your response , but in the communities we have more chronic illness present and especially with babies that are getting sick .
so we need to have adequate nurses in the health centres to deal with the viruses that are happening in the communities .
speaker :
just a comment .
oral questions , oral questions .
mr. iqaqrialu .
question 76 - 1 ( 2 ) :
capital plan for qikiqtarjuaq
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker this is directed to the minister of community government , housing and transportation .
one of the communities that i represent which is qikiqtarjuaq , according to the capital plan for 1999 / 2000 there are no projects slated for that community .
i wonder if that community has any projects planned for up to the year 2000 ?
speaker :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister of community government , housing &amp; transportation , mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
we &apos;ll be looking at the plans regarding these two communities .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
oral questions .
mr. nutarak .
question 77 - 1 ( 2 ) :
leave and replacement policy for nurses
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
this is directed to the minister of health and social services .
the nurses in the small communities sometimes take a long holiday or take long absences , do you have anything in place for replacing them ?
speaker :
thank you mr. nutarak .
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i would like to take this opportunity just to say that the earlier comment from the member from pelly bay is correct .
we realize that the nurses are under a lot of stress in our communities .
the department right now is working on a recruitment and retention plan to help those nurses .
there are contingency plans in place .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
second question , mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
some of the nurses are in the community for a long time .
they don &apos;t change and do you have a program for how often a nurse should be taking leave from a community or before replacing them ?
is it just up to the nurse how long she wants to stay in a community or do you have some kind of policy in place for this ?
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you mr. nutarak .
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my understanding is that if a nurse chose to be in a community then it is up to her or him as the case may be .
if the nurse chose to move to another community , then the health board would try to make that accommodation .
but , again , it depends on the operational requirements and the need in the community .
that is my understanding mr. speaker .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .

question 78 - 1 ( 2 ) :
contract for transitional plans on health and education boards
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. speaker .
you were absent at the time , mr. premier and the response was that they were not aware that the contract may have been awarded .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien when you are asking a question please refer to the speaker .
mr. okalik .
hon. paul okalik :
it relates to the minister of health portfolio , i believe that my colleague could answer that question .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
minister of health , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my understanding is that it is not an actual contract that is in place .
it is actually an employment contract .
the person has been hired by the department of the executive to do projects on behalf of the government .
one of those projects indeed would be looking at the amalgamation of the health boards into one , what type of an organizational plan would we have in place after march 31 / 2000 .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. picco .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. speaker .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister of health mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker it is not a study .
it is an employment contract .
working for the department .
it is not a contract , so it wouldn &apos;t have been issued on an rfp .
he has been hired .
he is an employee . i don &apos;t know if that clarifies how the man has been put in place .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. picco .
third supplementary , mr. o &apos;brien .
excuse me mr. o &apos;brien , your mike .
mr. o &apos;brien :
mr. speaker .
and i will get back to my question .
was there not anybody else in nunavut who could have done this work ?
call it a study , call it work , call it employment , whatever .
i am sure it is a short-term project that will end in a few months so that is the question .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister of health mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker i don &apos;t think anyone here wants to look at , or try to begrudge or impugn any type of handling of a job done by someone previously .
i don &apos;t think that is what we are here for .
i think the point is that mr. ramsden had the expertise , he had specialized knowledge , he did work with the boards when they were under the gnwt .
he has actually worked on a doctoral thesis .
he has the expertise needed .
specialized expertise , familiarity with our boards , the operating structures of the department of health as it is right now and indeed , looking at the reorganization of same .
if there is someone in nunavut that could do it , i don &apos;t know .
the point was , mr. speaker , that indeed the announcement was only made three short weeks ago .
i met with the health board people , we wanted to get someone in place right away , the members here have asked for the organizational chart , we cannot have it both ways .
so the person has the expertise , he is on the ground , he is working right now , he is on a contract with the executive there is no hiding of any facts .
there is no mystery , no controversy indeed mr. speaker there is nothing being hidden here .
it is all open .
so i would like to say again , i guess that the guy has the expertise and specialized knowledge and everything .
and i wouldn &apos;t want to impugn any motive as to what he was doing previously when he was the deputy minister .
i think the point has been made that the guy was hired .
he is on a short-term contract .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
final supplementary question .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker it is not my intention to impute a motive here .
i am just stating a fact .
to revisit this and to review some of the type or promote some of the type of model that we may put into place .
my question simply is , did we look at anybody else that could have done this type of a job or study , review or what you want to call it ?
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco , or mr. o &apos;brien , sorry .
mr. picco , minister of health .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i mean the member is referring to a previous government , it is not relevant to this government , what happened with that guy , with mr. ramsden in the past .
i don &apos;t know mr. ramsden very well personally or anything .
i think the guy has good professional qualifications .
i did see him briefly in ottawa when i was down there to meet with the minister , the honourable allan rock and spoke to him on it .
has the department of executive gone out and done an ad for the position , i don &apos;t think they have .
they tried to find the person to do the job , who has the expertise , the knowledge and familiarity with nunavut with the health boards , that is a pretty unique position .
so i would say to the member , i don &apos;t know if the department of the executive has placed an ad . i did not hire him .
he was not hired through my department , he was hired through the department of executive , but i am fully confident that mr. ramsden has the ability to do the job .
and again , the point here mr speaker , is that we wanted to fast track this organizational plan .
we just made the announcement about four weeks ago now with the health boards requesting the organizational chart as well as the chairs of the health boards and the ceo &apos;s .
that is what we are trying to expedite here .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
i would like to advise the members to be careful about asking questions about things that happened in the past .
this is a new government , this is a different government , not accountable for the previous government . thank you , oral questions .
mr. kattuk .
question 79 - 1 ( 2 ) :
status of negotiations on james bay islands
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i asked this question previously to the premier , but i will redirect my question .
regarding the offshore islands , i wonder what is the status of the negotiations on the james bay islands ?
speaker :
thank you mr. kattuk .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
next week and today the james bay cree will be meeting with my officials .
this week , just to identify the problem areas or concerns from both parties .
we are presently just trying to identify the issues at hand .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. okalik .
oral questions , mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
sanikiluaq people are concerned about not taking part in the discussions and also in the agreement .
they are worried that they will be restricted in the use of those islands which they have used traditionally for harvesting .
that is why the residents of sanikiluaq are concerned .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kattuk .
mr. okalik .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , as i stated earlier if there are going to be actual negotiations and an agreement the people of sanikiluaq will be involved .
the inuit are also able to hunt outside of the traditional harvesting areas and i would just like to further add that , the inuit are not restricted to harvesting in the traditional areas .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
oral questions , mr. irqittuq .
question 80 - 1 ( 2 ) : use of government facilities by contractors
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i am not sure which minister i should be directing my question to .
perhaps it is to the premier , or it may be going to ms. thompson .
the contracts with the government of the northwest territories .
we have adopted many of the contracts that were initiated by the gnwt and we have inherited them as nunavut .
those contractors , mr. speaker , who will be maintaining the present infrastructure ?
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
perhaps the member can clarify what exactly what he is talking about .
i think what he said was that the people who are building the garages and the other government infrastructure , is he saying that the contractors should be fixing their vehicles and what not .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. irqittuq could you clarify your question please .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
yes , thank you mr. speaker that is the question .
for example , in the arctic airports garage would they be able to use the arctic airports facilities even though they are just working on contracts ? speaker :
ms. thompson . hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
whatever needs to be fixed , on the government contracts no matter what contract it is , they &apos;re able use the facilities that are available in a community .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) thank you ms. thompson .
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
if there was nothing much available in a community and if certain equipment that is needed breaks down they can be fixed in the community .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. thompson .
mr. nutarak .
question 81 - 1 ( 2 ) :
recruitment of social workers
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
in the smaller communities the social workers are getting fewer and fewer and when people have quit they have not been replaced .
what is this department doing to recruit for those positions that have become vacant ? this is in the area of social work .
thank you speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
this is for mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
one of the most important positions or jobs in our smaller communities , indeed in all of our communities is the social worker .
the training of social workers is a different aspect .
there have been some training programs going on at nunavut arctic college .
we &apos;ve had programs for social workers , we just had seven recently graduate .
in igloolik , as an example , we have seven social workers that are involved in a training program .
they have finished their certificates and now would like to go on to the diploma program and as a department we are helping to facilitate that .
thank you mr. speaker .

school buses in iqaluit
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker last week on the 19th i made a members statement regarding the concerns in iqaluit here about bussing .
my question to the minister responsible for education is has any of the staff discussed the need for more bussing here in iqaluit due to the forced growth that we are facing ?
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
mr. speaker the bussing programs are done by standard criteria for each community .
and if that happens then bussing will also be looked at .
speaker :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
oral questions ?
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker could i please ask the minister to repeat that , due to technical problem i did not hear the answer .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
can you rephrase your answer mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. speaker .
the bussing program is status quo from the northwest territories government .
the criteria for bussing services to all communities are the same throughout nunavut .
if there is an increased requirement for iqaluit bussing , if that comes about that will be looked at .
i cannot answer that right now because we haven &apos;t been told about actual enrolments and requirements .
as soon as that arrives into our department through the divisional board then we will look at that immediately .
speaker :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
second question mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker the minister is saying that his department has not to date received any correspondence or any concern from either the iqaluit education authority or the district education council regarding bussing .
is that what he is saying ?
thank you mr. speaker .

mr. mclean .
item 10 :
replies to budget address
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. speaker .
a little over a week ago my honourable colleague from cambridge bay presented nunavut &apos;s first budget in this house .
in making my reply today i am mindful of the fact that ministers of finance across this country do not have the easiest of jobs .
when times are difficult they are the ones who have to go back and say no .
when times are good they are still the ones who have to sometimes say no to a request for new or expanded funding .
as members though we have an obligation to stand up for our community .
it is not easy for any of us to return our communities and be faced with questions as to what we could and could not achieve for them .
the minister &apos;s budget as we recognize it is essentially a status quo budget .
neither ministers nor regular members had the level of input into its development that i hope to see for the next year .
the fact that the minister did not announce any new programs reinforces that we have the opportunity now to think clearly and deeply about our collective goals in the future .
in his opening remarks the minister referred to changes that are in the planning stages and to substantial reforms that will require study and consultation .
i am pleased to have the opportunity today to speak to some of the priorities and aspirations of the people of baker lake .
standing on our own two feet achieving real self-sufficiency is a theme that i applaud .
the minister &apos;s budget address is admirable in the way in which he pledges to fight for nunavut &apos;s fair share .
what we need to do as a territory and a people is to move from dialogue and then to action on how we can provide more for ourselves .
real decentralization is a step , a job and a spin off in nunavut &apos;s smaller communities will help to kick-start local economies .
i again urge the government to move forward quickly on this issue .
the budget address touched on the vital issue of economic development and increasing employment opportunities .
it referred to efforts to develop a northern economic strategy and an economic development agreement in partnership with the federal government .
i am pleased to see the minister of sustainable development promoting nunavut during his recent trip to montreal .
it is vital that the message be heard elsewhere in canada and abroad that we are open to investment , that we are open to partnerships , that we are open for business .
the creation of a nunavut appropriate investment fund would be an initiative that i would support .
the premier &apos;s participation in last weeks premier &apos;s conference shows that we are finding our voice and finding forums in which our voice can be amplified .
the support of the western provinces and our northern neighbours for a highway linked to nunavut is gratifying .
i applaud the premier for his efforts .
the conference also called for strong efforts to be made in the field of trade development and tourism .
we need a team nunavut approach to these issues .
we are all stakeholders that are involved .
an economic strategy for nunavut must be holistic , being content with make work programs or indiscriminate subsidies is not a sustainable path to pursue .
incentive programs must be carefully thought out and avoid the traps made in the past by other governments .
our future depends to no small extent on the people of this land creating their own wealth through the traditional economy .
our economy has to grow based on our core strengths , both natural and human .
education is absolutely central to this .
as a strategic investment in our future , education must in a word include resources and get first call on additional funds , as it is through education that we gain strength .
education and health go hand in hand .
i was pleased for my colleague , the member for arviat , that his community will see the benefits of a p3 project , a new health centre .
i support the principle of p3 when projects focus on the education and health needs of nunavut .
mr. speaker , the minister &apos;s budget stressed the governments &apos; commitment to consultation and to integrating the values of our people into how we make decisions .
the months ahead will put us all to the test mr. speaker .
i look forward to joining the challenge .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
replies to budget address mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , many of my concerns were addressed by the honourable kelvin ng , minister of finance .
however , in my constituency where i serve the people of kimmirut and cape dorset there continues to be many areas of concerns to all of us .
housing , education and decentralization are among a few .
understandably housing is an issue to all the members and to the people of nunavut .
even in ottawa a standing committee report of the house of commons concluded that the shortage of housing and high cost of air transportation are crippling and restrict economic development efforts .
since our first and second session it is obvious that this issue continues to be an important subject .
mr. speaker the promotion of home ownership seems to be a catch 22 situation .
however , this program has been less successful here because of the higher cost of houses in nunavut .
in my constituency there are an average of 4 people living in each household , while 40 % have five or more people per household .
i am certain that this is a similar situation in every community .
i will quote from the budget address , &quot; the availability of adequate and affordable housing to meet the needs of our growing population is one of our highest infrastructure priorities &quot; .
mr. speaker , 117.4 million dollars is going towards education .
this must be used wisely .
we need to educate our youth and prepare them for future employment .
we must provide quality education .
education that is geared towards specialized areas such as schoolteachers , nurses and much more .
another area of education that we have talked a lot of as well as is the need of preserve our culture , our language , taking care of our land , hunting and harvesting .
the need for inuit qaujimajatunqangit to be integrated with our government .
we must consider the needs of our youth .
they are our future leaders and must be given every opportunity to succeed .
mr. speaker , recently the mayor of cape dorset expressed concerned on the radio about decentralization .
the decentralization model that was approved on october 2 , 1998 indicated that 56 full time positions were slated for cape dorset .
forty-one of these positions were to be transferred from iqaluit .
no positions were slated for kimmirut .
mr. speaker , before being elected , i worked as an employment assistance officer in our community .
we used to partner with the government , inuit organizations , and lending agencies when funds were not sufficient for a particular project .
with this budget these are the types of things that we will have to do .
mr. speaker , i am hopeful that this year &apos;s budget covers these issues .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. akesuk .
replies to budget address .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i am pleased to have the opportunity to reply to the budget address .
i would like to touch on several themes that are very important to me , and mr. speaker not all the themes that are important to me .
this is quite lengthy but it is scaled back so please bear with me .
the first theme is housing .
mr. speaker i am pleased to see 20 million dollars allocated for social housing .
i think it is important that we make a distinction between social housing and other types of housing .
mr. speaker there has been a growing private market for housing especially in the regional centres , as more and more people build or purchase their own housing .
however , we have had to make hard decisions about where to put limited public dollars .
do we help those people who already have money for housing ?
or do we help those who do not have money for housing ?
it that simple .
social housing programs help people who do not have money for housing .
so that all people can have access to affordable , safe , adequate , uncrowded quality housing .
mr. speaker , i think the government of nunavut should put its priority for housing in public housing .
mr. speaker , sometimes when we use expressions like social housing we don &apos;t have a good image of who we &apos;re talking about in this housing .
let me try to express this .
mr. speaker , there is a need for appropriate social housing for elders in all of our communities .
there are many people in nunavut who do not have that right now because we don &apos;t have the housing to make that right possible .
mr. speaker , there is also a need for social housing for many hard working families who have low incomes and don &apos;t enjoy the extra benefits of housing allowances .
mr. speaker , we all know that market rents in the north are often around 2,000 dollars a month for a family sized dwelling .
social housing allows for people to pay up to 30 % of their salary on housing whether the salary is very low and only part time or whether their salary is modest .
they can use the rest for food and for other essentials for their families .
mr. speaker , we need social housing for these people too .
lastly mr. speaker , we need social housing for people who have none at all .
there are homeless people in nunavut and iqaluit , something that should shame us all .
we have a homeless shelter in iqaluit that struggles to stay open when we have people literally freezing to death .
as examples of the difficulties they face , only in the last few weeks the staff received their layoff notices , the consequence of sporadic project funding .
mr. speaker sadly , we do need to have places for people to put their heads at night and the budget needs to reflect all of these housing priorities .
mr. speaker this is what social housing is all about and we need to have more in every community .
unfortunately 20 million dollars won &apos;t fulfil enough building of social housing units .
mr. speaker cmhc used to have a social housing program , which built new social housing units .
about seven years ago they stopped building new units and so the local housing associations are simply maintaining units they have and rebuilding the ones that are burnt down .
we need to re-negotiate the contract with cmhc , so that we can once again have new capital and a program for social housing .
we need to look at how to creatively build more social housing out of our own limited capital and o &amp; m dollars .
mr. speaker the budget address states that the government is extending the program to help people with the down payments towards homeownership .
mr. speaker this will help people move out of social housing and free up that unit for another family .
helping people with a down payment is a great boost for many people and i commend the government for doing it .
people should only get help that they require to make their down payment and secure a mortgage , not more .
those who are earning more should pay more towards their down payment .
we also have to look at each housing market .
houses in iqaluit are very expensive and in some other communities they are less expensive .
the second is a down payment , which i just mentioned .
the 3rd is a long term job with a regular salary from which to make mortgage payments and keep up the unit .
i know this government is committed in many ways to create these jobs , but mr. speaker there may be other hurdles .
there are some people , who might have all three now , but because they don &apos;t have a good credit rating , they can &apos;t get a mortgage .
but if they were to pay off this debt by a repayment schedule they could fix this .
mr. speaker if we are going to have programs to help people access something as important as housing , we need a companion program to help people deal with some of these other hurdles .
to get credit counselling , to help them consolidate their debts , to get a repayment plan , so that they could move forward with their lives .
this affects many inuit and we need to put extra effort , so that more inuit can benefit from these types of program .
mr. speaker we need general financial services in our communities to ensure that people receive information and support on how to run their financial affairs .
from help with income tax forms to obtaining mortgages and loans to setting up their own businesses , to obtaining credit counselling .
people need help holding on to their homes and assets during difficult periods .
mr. speaker i believe community based credit unions may be our hope for this , credit unions owned and operated locally with the profits in the community and in nunavut .
i look forward to seeing the government initiatives in regards to this in the future .
mr. speaker in terms of housing , i also note that the housing corporation has now been brought within the government departments .
a stand alone housing corporation was set up after a thorough study in 1972 .
over the years it has evolved through experience to a corporation which did pretty well with what it had to work with .
it was also flexible , for example , it had a two year capital delivery cycle which worked well in nunavut with the sea lift schedule .
mr. speaker i have many more concerns about housing but i want to quickly raise a few other matters today .
mr. speaker another area that i care very much about is education and i have two small children who will be entering the education system soon .
i want the best for them and for all the other children of nunavut .
i want an education system that will instil a love of learning and curiosity about the world .
that will invest children with the skills and knowledge that will allow them to contribute to their communities .
that will put them on par with the students in southern canada .
that will allow them to celebrate skilfully the use of the language and culture and give them a solid foundation for their future lives based on respect and excellence .
mr. speaker i am pleased to see seventeen new teaching positions will be added this year .
for a community like iqaluit we are seeing many new families moving with their children .
this increase in teachers won &apos;t even begin to deal with the new numbers of children .
it is expected that class sizes will increase here , we must look at the need for teachers again before the year is out .
perhaps this is an area where some of the savings from phasing out the regional education council can be emphasized .
mr. speaker another theme that i would like to speak on is caring .
they may have turned to drugs and alcohol or to violence and they have a negative impact on themselves and on many people all around them .
they are the people who are in the courts and in the prisons and they are in the hospitals from suicide attempts .
they can &apos;t keep their jobs or their children may be in foster care .
mr. speaker we have a drug and alcohol centre in iqaluit that is closed .
it is the only one in nunavut and they don &apos;t even know when it &apos;s going to be re-opened .
there are many people in nunavut who need this help , i don &apos;t see anything in this budget that says how we are going to help people deal with a troubled past .
i don &apos;t think it is enough to build a better future for them , we also have to help them move forward with their lives into the better future .
more employment opportunities will not be the full answer , not the total solution .
where are the initiatives to help men and women in the jails deal with their anger and violence and to learn new skills .
we know a lot of what has been delivered in the past , hasn &apos;t always helped people , how is nunavut is going to be different ?
mr. speaker the budget talks about shuffling government structures around , phasing out health boards and education boards , phasing in the departments .
mr. speaker i would have liked to see more on our caring programs in the budget address , more than one paragraph and i hope we will hear more about this in the future .
mr. speaker the last theme i want to touch on is a need to work together as regular mla &apos;s .
i want to work effectively with the other mla &apos;s in the house and on the standing committees .
mr. speaker these are my comments on the budget address . mr. speaker i would like to thank all the members for listening .
thank you mr. speaker .

i &apos;ve just asked my executive assistant to call the deputy minister for health to come here right now to the hall .
thank you mr chairperson .
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :

thank you , mr. nutarak , did you have another comment to make ?
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i just had a conversation with the speaker , and mr. ng .
i would like to revoke what i said and start with bill one , as they are ready , i believe .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
these will also have to be included .
that is for your information .
at this time , i believe it would be best if we deal with community government , housing and transportation .
we will deal with that first .
are we agreed ?
i would like to ask the minister of this department - community government , housing and transportation , mr. jack anawak to go up to the witness table for opening remarks .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
as you are aware , community government , housing and transportation used to be three departments during the gnwt days ; transportation , housing and maca .
they were combined into one department and we were able to realign our department . this amalgamation brought three very similar operations together .
this has allowed us the opportunity to begin looking at new ways to deliver our programs and services more effectively . the departmental structure reflects four basic branch operations .
i should note that the housing branch is also referred to as the nunavut housing corporation .
it operates under the nunavut housing corporation act very similar to the nwt housing corporation .
the nunavut housing corporation has its own budget which is made up of funding provided by the canada mortgage &amp; housing corporation ( cmhc ) , plus funding provided by the nunavut government .
the corporation &apos;s budget will be finalized once the main estimates are approved .
mr. chairman and honourable members , we face a major challenge in the area of social housing , especially since cmhc is no longer providing the capital dollars to build new units .
furthermore , as the minister of finance indicated in his budget , cmhc is also reducing annually the operations and maintenance ( o &amp; m ) funding it transfers to us .
we will need to work together as we attempt to deal with our social housing needs .
we must look at new ways of doing things .
we must seek out innovative ideas and solutions .
i would like to have a review of existing programs , to see if there are ways we could do things differently , to be more effective and more efficient .
i would like to look at some new ideas , some new initiatives , and some new partnerships .
i invite the ideas and advice of the members of this assembly to assist me with this challenge .
the mission statement of the department , along with our current goals , flow out of the business plan document .
you can see in our goals that we want to develop open communication and consultation with our partners .
we want to help communities enhance their capacities , making it easier for local management and delivery of programs and services .
we will also be enhancing community fire fighting training . this is an effort to reduce our high fire loss record and stabilize fire insurance rates as the insurance industry has been expressing concern .
we will also be much more proactive in prevention programs , especially in the &quot; learn not to burn &quot; program offered through the schools .
i have also asked my deputy to ensure that we enhance our search and rescue training and become more supportive to local authorities during local community search operations .
the budget .
the department &apos;s budget figures can be found in the main estimates document starting on page 7-3 .
the various pages in the main estimates break down the $ 97,287 million dollar o &amp; m budget amount .
as well , they provide information on the $ 35,764 million dollar capital budget .
you will note some large amounts in the main estimate document .
for example , on page 7-5 , on the grants and contribution line , is an amount of $ 26,465 million dollars .
this includes hamlet contribution funding known as the municipal operating assistance program .
it includes the water / sewer subsidy program funding , equalization grants for the town , grants in lieu of taxes and community development grants .
you will also notice on page 7-12 under transportation , on the other o &amp; m line , an amount of $ 12,323 million dollars .
this amount may seem rather large , but it includes all the funding which flows to communities under the airport operating contracts .
these are necessary dollars to keep the airports in nunavut operational .
on page 7-9 under housing , on the capital contributions line , is an amount of $ 19,060 million dollars .
this represents the capital money provided by the government of nunavut , to the nunavut housing corporation , to assist in the delivery of a number of housing programs .
as well , the nunavut housing corporation receives $ 33 , 243 million dollars in operation and maintenance dollars .
the housing corporation uses these dollars plus the $ 58 million dollars it receives from cmhc to develop its annual operating budget .
as mentioned earlier , once the departments &apos; main estimates are approved , the housing corporation will finalize its budget .
there have been concerns expressed that there was no consultation with communities as the framework budget was being developed , and that was the case .
the consultation was completed by the gnwt and the information was then filed with the former office of the interim commissioner ( oic ) as part of the transition planning process .
a review of this information showed that the projects proposed far exceeded the limited resources that would be available to the nunavut government april 1 / 99 .
it was agreed that the following criteria would be used by departments to allocate capital in the transition year .
contracts in place / funds already committedstatutory or regulatory requirementshealth and safety requirementsthird party funding in place / cost shared programs social housing , which is one of our priorities .
once these criteria were applied across all departments a capital budget was developed and that is what is now presented in the main estimate document .
i look forward to that process so that we can seek input from our communities , so that we can develop the first nunavut five year capital plan .
building a new government and starting a new fiscal year under new financial circumstances is not an easy task .
i appreciate all the hard work of the mla &apos;s as we work together to get nunavut off to a strong start without deficit financing .
i had wanted to make those points and mr. chairman i would like to go up to the witness table at this time .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister for community government , housing and transportation .
you can go up to the witness table and also mr. mike ferris and mr. rafter .
i apologize for not saying your names properly .
you can go up to the witness table .
we have mr. mike ferris and mr. rafter , and we also have the minister of community government , housing and transportation .
welcome to our meeting .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman following are the comments after meetings that were held with the minister of community government , housing and transportation .
mr. anawak appeared before the committee on the morning of april 28th 1999 .
the main estimate summary provided to the committee indicated total 1999 / 2000 expenditures of 133 million dollars of which 35.764 million is for capital spending .
the committee was very impressed with the ministers &apos; presentation , especially with respect to the comprehensive and detailed nature of the information provided .
in reference to social housing , the issue of social housing was the subject of extensive discussion during the ministers appearance .
the minister identified a number of critical issues facing the department and the nunavut housing corporation with respect to social housing in nunavut .
the minister advised that he would be shortly appointing a ministers committee to take a look at the issue of social housing .
the standing committee was pleased to hear that the minister was open to ways of including regular members to the review process .
the standing committee urges the department to undertake a broad review of housing issues in nunavut including the issue of facilitating home ownership .
members of the committee raised a number of points related to the housing issue .
among these were the difficulties facing families who want to get into the private housing market ;
disincentives for seasonal workers to seek jobs because of rent increases in social housing units ; the apparent unfairness of the mdapp monies being available to high income earners ;
the poor quality of workmanship of many of the southern contractors ;
the need for more energy efficient , nunavut appropriate , low cost housing units .
another issue was the high cost / high mortgage rates for new homeowners and high heating and fuel costs .
the minister indicated his desire for the department to review options and alternatives across the board .
the minister also indicated that he was pressing his federal counterparts on this issue .
the committee urges the minister to make every effort to pursue solutions to the housing crisis in nunavut and to maintain openness to innovative ideas and solutions .
the committee recommends that a review of the dap program be undertaken , and that the department consider raising the amounts of money available to 30 thousand dollars .
the committee looks forward to working with the minister and other stakeholders in addressing this central issue to the wellbeing of nunavummiut .
in reference to the iqaluit airport , the committee was briefed on the serious impact that federal regulatory changes have had on the iqaluit airport and others in nunavut .
these regulatory changes will impact such items as gravel airstrips and emergency response times .
the committee is supportive of the minister in seeking additional resources from relevant federal bodies .
in reference to the inuit employment plan .
the minister indicated that the inuit employment plan for the department would be released shortly .
the committee looks forward to the opportunity to reviewing this plan in detail .
in reference to the legislative reform review . the minister indicated that the review of departmental legislation has recently begun .
the minister indicated that the department will begin consultations with the newly formed nunavut association of municipalities .
the committee welcomed the invitation to make suggestions for the legislation changes .
that is all the comments that i have mr. chairman .
mr. chairman . i move that this committee recommend the department undertake a broad review of housing issues in nunavut including the social housing crisis and the need to facilitate home ownership .
second , mr. chairman i move that this committee recommend that the department provide a mid-year progress report to the standing committee for a review in october of this year .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. o &apos;brien , and members of the legislative assembly , i believe you made two recommendations .
i would like you to read the first motion .
first of all , mr. o &apos;brien .
committee motion 14 - 1 ( 2 ) :

mr. o &apos;brien .
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , on the first motion .

thank you .

questions or comments to the motion ?

those opposed ?
motion is carried .
general comments regarding community government .
general comments .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
regarding community government .
for many years i have been involved in community government and i have also been involved in community councils at that level .
we have had difficulties with the territorial government that came about because there were cutbacks by the government .
i think one of the things i would like to see in this department , since community populations are increasing , we need to have equitable capabilities in the communities for community services .
for example , most of the communities in my constituency are facing the same problems because the municipal services equipment are not keeping up with the community growth .
since there has not been any increases in funding for those services , that has caused some hardships in the communities .
so i have been thinking that the funding provided to the communities should be on par with community growth and that funding formula should be changed to reflect that .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i thank you mr. iqaqrialu , if you wish to respond to that mr. minister or ...
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
the funding that is provided to the communities is divided according to the population and what mr. iqaqrialu has said is very true .
communities are experiencing rapid growth and i think the census of these communities is behind .
we will make due adjustments .
sometimes funding is not enough even though you say you have this many people and they don &apos;t get per capita funding .
we need to consider that in june we do not expect that all people will be there .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) : thank you mr. anawak .
mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i have a comment as well as a question .
in regards to housing in the communities , we are increasingly seeing problems in trying to get more social housing available in the communities .
what is going to be happening in the future , say in the next five years ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
yes , i agree with what mr. alakannuark is saying that many of the problems can be worked out at the local level and when that can be done in a community .
we are required by legislation to go by public tender and to contract whoever is more able to do the work .
we may be going against the land claims agreement which is administered by nti .
i agree that if building can be done at the community level and local people can do it , we support that .
that money should be going to the community , but if the reviewing committee is looking at that i will fully support working towards that goal .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
there is 46 million that is divided between the hamlets operations &amp; maintenance .
this 46 million dollars was arrived at by the gnwt from the 1980 census for o &amp; m in community governments .
for example , in the year 2001 , if there was a sudden change , would this amount be changed to reflect the change in growth ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
you said 26 million ? 46 million .
sorry i was looking for that figure of 46 million for operations .
i can &apos;t see right now where we would get more money , maybe if you clarify your question further i might be able to give you a better response .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
you said there was 35 million without the capital for community governments .
the figures that we are working on right now would have to be adjusted accordingly to what has been transferred to the communities .
so if we are going to transfer responsibilities to the community governments then that figure that i was quoting would have to be increased .
i think that was the commitment that the gnwt had made , as more responsibilities are turned over to the communities there have to be funding increases as well .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
yes , mr. nutarak , you have made yourself clear .
thank you .
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
yes , as i said before , we want to look at housing needs in the communities .
i know there is a nunavut association of municipalities now and i think that many of the communities may want to see some changes , especially in terms of turning over responsibility for programs .
if they are going to be administering programs , for example for dpw , the money that dpw would have used will be handed over to the hamlet council .
the hamlets know what the needs are in the communities so we should , as a government , be looking for ways and means to accommodate the needs of the community and their priorities .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
i think your question has been answered . mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i think i was the only one who wanted to talk about this issue .
thank you for getting back to me so promptly .
the hamlet council in the community is a municipal government in our community .
the gnwt had a policy , the municipal governments were non-profit organizations .
if they are taking over more programs from the government it has to be made clear that the hamlet needs to know exactly what kind of organization they are going to be .
are they for profit or not ?
i think that if they are going to be for profit they are going to take away from potential business growth in a community by taxing them .
i think we have to keep the hamlet councils as non-profit organizations and this needs to be clarified before hamlet councils are given more responsibilities that government presently provides .
for that reason , to me that is very important .
so , i think that we need to make very clear policies about transferring government programs to the hamlets , before full community empowerment goes ahead .
i know that it may be a good thing , but i just wanted to clarify this before we got too far in the discussions about this department .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. anawak would you like to make a comment on that ?
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
yes , his comments were very clear , i can even make an example that in some communities they have heavy equipment , either to remove snow or to work on the roads .
sometimes private businesses don &apos;t have anything to do because the hamlet councils are responsible for clearing up the roads .
in order to support the communities more , when there are other people outside of the hamlet council that can actually work , we would like to utilize them and help them out .
in regards to the hamlet councils and co-ops , i just used those as an example .
for example , perhaps it would be cheaper if we could work for one year with the help of the hamlet council , because they do have heavy equipment to work on gravel .
right now , we have not had a chance to review this or what the needs are in the communities or what there is in the communities .
perhaps we have not been asking questions of the communities , because we are quite new .
i will be requiring the support of the regular members and the communities as well as the association of municipalities .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i am going to be talking about something totally different from previously .
i just want you to know that the housing associations were used by gnwt to find out how many people were living in one unit .
the funding that was allotted to the housing association never even considered the people .
for example , in the smaller communities , like clyde river , the budget was much larger than in the larger communities .
some units only have two people living in the unit and the price , the rent , is the same whether you are overcrowded or not .
we don &apos;t view these people in the communities so this tends to bring up some social problems in the community in my opinion .
i just wanted to point this out further .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
i am going to use myself as an example .
i think we are going to have to be aware that for those people that cannot afford to buy their own home they cannot get housing for a long time .
i haven &apos;t lived in a smaller community for a long time so at times i feel i know the communities , but i realize that the communities know their needs best .
the government hasn &apos;t known the community needs in the past , so therefore they would resolve the problem for them when it could have been resolved locally .
for that reason i will require support from the members and the public out there in order to utilize the funds .
these smaller communities are the best people to know what their requirements are , along with the public .
with the support of the house and the members of the public i am sure we can develop this program in the upcoming years .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
mr. iqaqrialu i think he responded to your question adequately .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
mr. chairperson if there are other people who would like to speak i could stay quiet for a while so that i can give more opportunity to others .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairperson .
thank you david .
i know how i felt when i was asking lots of questions .
that &apos;s okay david that &apos;s what we &apos;re here for .
in his opening remarks , the minister talked about this amalgamation , which would allow them an opportunity to look at new ways to deliver programs and services more effectively .
i am wondering mr. chairman if the minister could provide us with some insight as to how this is being accomplished to date .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. anawak
hon. jack anawak :
i would just like to mention a couple of things first .
we will be working on it as soon as possible in order to better have an idea of what kind of programs we need to deliver , what better ways there are out there .
but in terms of the better delivery of services within the department , i wonder if i might ask the deputy minister to briefly outline the amalgamation of the department .
chairperson :
mr. ferris .
mr. ferris ( deputy minister , community government , housing &amp; transportation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
the amalgamation is proceeding , we are still in the process of rolling together at the regional level the staff that we inherited from the government of the northwest territories .
it &apos;s obviously a little bit easier to structure your headquarters when you are putting new positions in place .
there &apos;s very good things that municipal &amp; community affairs was doing , there are very good things that the housing corporation was doing and the same with transportation .
so we are looking at , in the amalgamation to draw on those strengths , to build a department that we can take and come up with some efficiencies in the delivery .
at the regional level the headquarters , although some of the staff would have reporting links to the housing corporation , they will be delivering a united service .
but there will be , the same in transportation , we have at least three or four positions that we have to maintain , to ensure that we keep certification on airports .
so they are special , but where we can amalgamate and reduce the numbers and yet deliver more programs efficiently , that &apos;s what we are looking at .
we will be involving , as we did through the nunavut consultation conferences , start more consultation with the communities and with our partners on those levels of service .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ferris .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i am just looking at 7.1 in the mains and it shows three distinct , separate divisions of community government , housing &amp; transportation .
i am wondering if the organizational structure and the chart is going to be changing in light of looking at amalgamating these services in the future .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
either one of you can respond .
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak :
chairperson :
mr. ferris .
mr. ferris :
thank you mr. chairperson .
just to add one further comment , when we appeared before the standing committee we were given some advice about a report that did exist on the old housing corporation .
we have secured a copy of that report and are looking at it .
as the minister said then , and again now , there could be some change in the organizational structure .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
if we are going to be changing the contents in order to benefit the communities we will require the assistance and support of the regular members .
if we are going to develop the nunavut government we are going to be requiring your assistance and we will ask you for your support .
thank you .

minister anawak .
hon. jack anawak :
again , we will be starting the process .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i would like my name to be pronounced right , it is not irqittuq , it is irqittuq , mr. chairman thank you .
i would like to be represented and addressed properly .
in the ministers &apos; department under 5.3 , when you open the page to 5.6 , the capital from 99 / 2000 what is in the capital ?
i think you have stated that you would like to work with the hamlet councils so that you can set up the capital plans .
did i understand you correctly ?
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. irqittuq , we are not dealing with the department of justice , we are dealing with community government , housing &amp; transportation .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
mr. chairman , i never mentioned the justice department i was talking about the main estimates for capital plan .
i am talking about the capital plan , i am not in the justice department .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
when you said 5.3 i open the page and it says department of justice .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
i didn &apos;t say 5.7 i said 7.3 .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you . mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
well i heard 5.3 too ...
&gt; &gt; laughter
we also want to come to an agreement with the communities when we are talking about capital projects in their communities .
chairperson :
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i apologize , i did say 5.3 when i was trying to talk about 7.3 .
thank you mr. chairperson . in 7.3 we have contributions and on this page are these contributions set for a specific purpose ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i didn &apos;t realize that the details were here .
i misunderstood the inuktitut term that was used to explain the operations , maintenance , capital and so on .
does that mean that it has to go ahead this year .
chairperson :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
i think i understand your question .
if it is already using money then , of course , we have to pay for the blueprints and the plans and so on , specifications .
i think you are talking about the grants &amp; contributions here which is 59 million here .
we have to specify what these grants &amp; contributions are going to be used for before they are given to the community .
chairperson :
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i understand exactly what you are saying , so i will be able to give more money to mr. arvaluk .
my other comment is the hamlets and the housing authorities .
in my constituency you stated that you would like to support the communities that would like to build private homes .
of course , we all want to help those communities , but the hamlets and the housing authorities never seem to be able to get these projects going .
i am not going to say a specific name but this person owns a private business in igloolik maintaining furnaces .
there are about 1200 people in igloolik and this person is the only oil burner mechanic in the whole town .
they are going to social services because they are not being utilized because they can &apos;t make any money .
they have journeyman certificates , tickets and everything but they can &apos;t get anywhere .
i like where you are coming from and if there is a private business person or journeyman ticketed in the community , then use these people .
we keep saying that there &apos;s article 24 that we have to use as a nunavut government .
we have to use article 24 because we were created because of the agreement .
chairperson :
mr. minister .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
i believe you are talking about housing associations who have their own staff , their own oil burner mechanics on staff .
if the rcmp need an oil burner mechanic they use the one that is on the staff of the housing association .
we can look into this further , it is not only oil burner mechanics it is also carpenters who could be contracted by the rcmp , the co-ops and so on .
i was just using this as an example , for example if there is no contractor in the community .
chairperson :
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you for that explanation mr. minister .
for those business people who are just starting out , if they have registration and a business license , they are business people no matter what trade or business they are in .
with all these barriers a person who is very capable of starting a business , but does not have the cash flow is incapable of bidding on these contracts .
they might go to economic development because they don &apos;t have the requirements , they cannot get started .
even with nunavut government and the agreement and so on , we are still setting up those barriers for people who want to start their own businesses .
so , we have to look at ways and means of how it could be easier for the people of nunavut , if we are talking about keeping the money in nunavut .
chairperson :
mr. minister .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
yes , i understand exactly where you are coming from .
i think it was last year in the fall , where we ran into some problems .
i believe it was a water reservoir in coral harbour that was going to be built .
i am well aware of these problems and i do see the need to review it so the communities can prosper .
i know exactly where you are coming from .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
since our clock is ticking and we do have names on the list , there is mr. mclean , mr. akesuk and mr. tootoo .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. chairman .
these are just general comments from myself and i don &apos;t really require an answer .
going through community government i think we got 1 % of the allocation in the keewatin .
housing we got 0 % allocation in the keewatin , this is baker lake i &apos;m talking about .
in transportation , 0 % of the allocation for the keewatin .
i see from the footprints ll document , that there are no adm &apos;s in the footprints ll document and i see three of them here .
i am hoping that the minister has a detailed work plan in place for his assistant deputy ministers to travel around and take some workload off of the very capable deputy minister .
i think we will agree that we should see the adm &apos;s more in our communities all over nunavut .
but like i say , these are just general comments .
the housing part of this , and i was phoned by a few people , and public works and services are doing all of the technical work .
to me that , i don &apos;t think that is a very good idea .
you have public works doing the technical work , and housing corporation delivering the program and the work .
i can see conflicts there .
it worked in the past .
i don &apos;t want to go back to the old government thing .
another item . a transportation strategy .
are we even looking at developing a transportation strategy in regards to nunavut ?
i know we had a transportation strategy that reflected the old west and they were to build highways , build highways build highways .
i didn &apos;t see us really over here developing a core transportation strategy that reflected all the communities from the middle to the larger ones .
navcanada fees .
i beat that one up pretty bad when i could with the business community .
we do , and all of a sudden , we get hit with , we are penalized because of our isolation with navcanada fees .
we know that it is a not for profit organization .
so when their costs increase , costs increase to the consumers .
it really helped by bring down the price of apples , and oranges and bread and eggs and stuff like that .
i think navcanada adds three to five to seven percent on to the cost of commercial items .
it is just my general comments .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
before a response from the minister , we made a motion that we have to adjourn at six o &apos;clock . it is now getting on to six o &apos;clock .
i would like to ask the committee what their wishes .
do you want to go ahead ?
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i have quite a lot of questions and comments to make .
i would like to adjourn now .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
that has to go by motion if you want to adjourn . if it is the committees wish to adjourn .
mr. iqaqrialu i believe you want to adjourn for the day .
did you want to move a motion ?
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :

thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker i am proud to stand in our legislative assembly today to congratulate one of our teachers for being presented with the roy c.
hill award . nick newberry , a teacher at inuksuk high school , was awarded this award for his work in developing and implementing the terry fox program .
this program was designed as an alternative for students whose needs were not met by the mainstream education programs and has been on-going for the past12 years .
this program includes academics , land and survival skills , life skills , and community work and service .

ministers &apos; statement 19 - 1 ( 2 ) :
gjoa haven gasoline situation
hon. manitok thompson :
thank you mr. speaker .
sampling and testing of gasoline , diesel and aircraft fuels is completed before the products are shipped to the community .
the gjoa haven , cambridge bay and taloyoak gasoline passed tests for these specifications .
after the tanks were filled in the community , another set of samples were taken and tested .
these also met the specifications .
in response to the concerns raised by the community , additional samples were taken and tested .
one set of these samples was sent to an independent testing facility as requested by the hamlet .
a copy of the results of these tests was sent directly to the hamlet by the testing facility .
analysis of all these samples was completed by three separate facilities .
alberta research council , petro-canada and advanced engine technologies ltd .
advanced engine technologies is also inspecting the damaged engine parts .
in addition they are conducting , &quot; cold weather testing &quot; .
a preliminary report is expected this week and a final report should be ready in early june .
the department has incurred total costs of $ 39,300 in an attempt to address the concerns of gjoa haven residents about the gasoline .
i would also like to emphasize that this is the same gasoline that is being used in both cambridge bay and taloyoak .
it is from the same shipment .
i am happy to report that recently there was a fishing derby in gjoa haven and there were no major snowmobile problems reported .
i also note that there was recent mention of snowmobile races that were held in the community .
again , no problems were reported .
thank you mr. speaker .

nunavut / kivalliq road link
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i would like to take this time today to comment on the premiers &apos; statements on the road link to kivalliq and nunavut .
we hear costs but to every project there is a cost , but this project the payback to all of nunavut will be huge .
we are dealing with federal transfer payments and we are all saying that we need more money for housing , education and health .
a road to the kivalliq opens up both the tourism sector and the non-renewable resource sector .
this means jobs in tourism and mining .
jobs mean taxes both personal and corporate .
it also means royalties .
this means we as residents of nunavut are starting to stand on our own two feet by generating much needed revenue that nunavut needs to run programs .
mr. speaker , a road to the kivalliq region brings benefits to all members of nunavut .
thank you .

mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
this person was recognized but this person was from my constituency and has moved to iqaluit because of his job .
if it wasn &apos;t for this person i don &apos;t know if we would be sitting here at this house .
if it wasn &apos;t for this person i am sure the land claims agreement wouldn &apos;t be as comprehensive as it is .
so i would like this person to rise , mr. paul quassa , i would like to recognize mr. paul quassa .

item 6 :
oral questions
question 84 - 1 ( 2 ) :
status of doctor for igloolik
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
yesterday i asked a question to the minister of health and the response i got was inaccurate .
the question i brought was regarding doctors .
mr. speaker , when i asked him what the status was , apparently he misunderstood my question .
so my question now is what is the status of the doctor now ?
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , in the translation yesterday it came across as the nurse in igloolik and not the doctor .
in the original question when i reviewed it just now , indeed the translation was lost , so i think we have to get our hansard fixed .
the intention of the doctor was to move to igloolik .
when i came back from igloolik i contacted the health board through the department to find out the status of the doctor moving to igloolik was , and is .
to date , i still haven &apos;t got an official response from the health board on the status of the doctor , when the doctor was moving to igloolik and on the housing situation .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
oral questions .
mr. iqaqrialu .
question 85 - 1 ( 2 ) :
ntpc report for clyde river
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i will be asking my question to the minister responsible for ntpc .
i have not yet received any documents regarding the ntpc .
i am not asking for all the documents , i just want the documents specific to clyde river .
that is a report that was promised to me by the minister responsible for ntpc .
i just want the report specifically for clyde river .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister responsible for the nunavut power corporation mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , yes i have had a couple of conversations with the member on the power corporation .
as most members realize , the northwest territories power corporation actually has two ministers .
the minister for the northwest territories is mr. dent and i am responsible for operational issues here in the nunavut region .
after saying that , the information on the clyde river plant , i requested that information from the power corporation , which is at their head office in hay river .
i spoke to my staff about it this morning and i haven &apos;t got that information right now but will commit to getting that information to the member today .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
oral questions .
mr. nutarak .
question 86 - 1 ( 2 ) :
tunnel between schools in pond inlet
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
this question is for the minister of education .
we have two schools , one older than the other .
they &apos;re looking a putting a tunnel or connector between the two schools .
one doesn &apos;t have a gym , so the idea behind putting in this tunnel was so that the students could go over there during school without going outside .
i have received correspondence from the gnwt .
one was built in 1961 and we have a problem with the schools , i would like the minister of education to give me an update on what is happening with these two schools .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
yes , i did get that letter from the baffin divisional board of education , mr. david qamaniq , from pond inlet .
i think the member is well aware that we did have the safety officer check out the school .
i think it was during the gnwt days that the minister of education , charles dent , realised that following the safety code , they couldn &apos;t build this tunnel .
even if this was put into the 99 / 2000 budget we can &apos;t go ahead because it is a fire hazard to put the tunnel from the old school to the new school .
if the older facility caught on fire it could become a safety concern for the students .
with that in mind , we still haven &apos;t done anything about the tunnel between the two schools .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
second question mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
although i didn &apos;t hear a question in there , mr. minister you can respond .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
according to what i hear him saying , i think he is asking us to rectify the situation .
at this time we are trying to accumulate all the information on the pond inlet school .
i have my staff working on this issue and i also want to hear from the government staff and others who usually deal with building standards and codes .
i will instruct them to discuss this matter with the education council in pond inlet and also work with the capital estimates within the department of education .
we will deal with the issue tonight .
we are all aware of what the members concern is , mr. speaker , that one of the schools has a gymnasium and the other does not .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
third question mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
as the education minister stated he had asked the fire marshall to investigate the school , although he met with the council they couldn &apos;t come up with a concrete solution .
last week we started working on this issue and the fire marshall was unable to respond to our questions .
so perhaps , if the minister could go to pond inlet and meet with the council , they could rectify this situation in pond inlet .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
i don &apos;t know if there was a question in his comments .
mr. speaker , i know they couldn &apos;t come to an agreement when the government staff members and the community education council , hamlet council or housing council met .
when the government officials cannot agree with the entities in the communities , they usually ask their superiors what they should do .
i think we will have to deal with the options first and after that respond to the member as to whether i have to go to pond inlet to meet with the education council .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
oral questions .
mr. akesuk .
question 87 - 1 ( 2 ) :
pipeline to water reservoir
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question is to the minister of public works , telecommunications &amp; technical services .
i went to my home community over the weekend and a concern was raised in regards to the pipeline going to the water reservoir .
it goes all the way up to the lake and this pipeline is pretty old .
the health officials have already investigated the pipeline for safety reasons when gnwt was our government .
my question is , do you have any money available to deal with the old pipeline ?
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. akesuk .
minister of public works , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i am aware of the community &apos;s concern over this issue and i will look into it and see what we can do and reply to you when we find out .
speaker :
thank you ms. thompson .
second question mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
the health inspectors were in cape dorset for a while and they stated that we could only use that pipeline for up to one more year .
once the pipeline breaks , or if it erodes , or gets damaged , we would have to deal with this as an emergency issue .
i was wondering ms. thompson , if you could look into this as soon as possible .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. akesuk .
minister of public works , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
yes , i will get my officials to work on the pipeline as soon as possible .
i know that the community is quite concerned about it .
we will also look into the reports that were written after the investigation and i will direct my officials to look into that .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. thompson .
oral questions .
mr. kattuk .
question 88 - 1 ( 2 ) :
gun control legislation
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question is for the premier .
perhaps a majority of the nunavut residents are concerned about gun control legislation .
i would just like further clarification on your response , what the status is , mr. premier .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kattuk .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i would have to respond the same , we are still looking into this and we &apos;re looking into the legal aspects of this .
we will keep on top of it .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. okalik .

question 89 - 1 ( 2 ) :
policy for establishing full time doctors in nunavut communities
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question is to the minister of health .
mr. speaker , i want to know what the policy is regarding establishing full time doctors in nunavut communities .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
minister of health , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
on the positioning of doctors in communities , as the minister , it is my aim to try and get as many doctors into communities as possible .
we are going to try and do that over the next year as we phase out the boards and take on that responsibility .
at the present time the staffing of doctors , individual doctors is at the request of the individual health board , we then try to facilitate that arrangement .
again , it is based on the demand at the community level and the availability of doctors to make that move .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
oral questions , mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. speaker .
is the minister , when we abolish the health boards , going to make a commitment to establishing full time doctors in communities that qualify for them ?
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
minister of health , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i can commit to looking into it mr. speaker .
as i said , it depends on the availability of doctors and i guess what we would be looking for in the communities would be a general practitioner .
right now , as we all know there are demand problems , supply problems with medical professionals , not only in nunavut , but all over canada and indeed , in north america .
that is one of the things we are trying to do in the department of health .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
oral questions .
mr. tootoo .
question 90 - 1 ( 2 ) :
gun control legislation
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question goes to the premier .
as my colleague from hudson bay indicated , he had asked about any action being taken on gun control legislation with ottawa .
last week i believe , i posed a question to the minister of justice and if his department was going to be taking a look at it .
is it going to be through executive or is it going to be through justice ?
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you mr. speaker .
southern governments are involved in this court action .
my department will be handling the situation and we will use some expertise at the department of justice as there are legal matters .
from what i understand there is no court hearing set as of yet , at the supreme court of canada level .
we are monitoring the situation and we will continue to do so and see what we can do for nunavut .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. okalik .
second question , mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
not whether we are waiting to hear if we are going to court or not .
i am just wondering if any talks have proceeded in that area .
just setting up a dialogue with the federal government to look at possible changes .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
government leader mr. okalik .
hon. paul okalik :
i believe the reason why they are in court is that attempts were made to try and modify the legislation and they wouldn &apos;t be in court if they hadn &apos;t tried that .
i could look into it and get back to the member .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
oral questions .
mr. puqiqnak .
question 91 - 1 ( 2 ) :
impact of proposed highway on taloyoak
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question is to the minister responsible for transportation .
as the qamanittuaq member had stated , he made a members &apos; statement that he is happy about constructing a road in the keewatin region .
everybody is quite happy and pleased about the proposal .
my question on behalf of kitikmeot and taloyoak , is will it have a social impact on the community of taloyoak or will it also benefit the community of taloyoak ?
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
minister of transportation , mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
we have to find ways to solve the transportation issues .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
second question mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
they tend to get stuck in our area so that is why i asked this question .
perhaps we can get the cargo ships to come earlier to my communities because they arrive pretty late in the season .
when they arrive late with the construction materials we have to build the units pretty late in the fall .
if the ships came earlier in the fall we could start the construction earlier .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
please try to keep your questions brief .
if you are going to use examples try to keep them brief so you don &apos;t repeat your questions and are brief .
minister mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
yes , thank you .
we have to look at transportation issues in all aspects whether it be aircraft , ships or constructing roads .
we have to look at transportation as a whole .
we have to look at everything ; we have to look at all aspects of transportation when dealing with this issue and we will keep updating you as we progress .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. anawak .
third question mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
today is 1999 and we still haven &apos;t started dealing with it this year .
i remember in 1993 at the leaders summit there was a motion raised to have the cargo ships come earlier in the fall .
i started working on this issue back in 1993 .
we had requested an earlier arrival for the ships , especially in the two communities that i have mentioned .
i was told that i would have to make a request to god and pray that the ice would melt a lot sooner than it actually did .
however , this is not a joke , i was asked that question .
if the department is going to be constructing a road it will be a lot easier for the two communities .
if they are not going to be constructing a road , perhaps they should be extending the airstrips in the two communities .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
i know there are other members who would like to ask questions so if you could use shorter examples , so that the other members could have an opportunity to ask questions .
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
i can tell my colleague that ntcl creates the schedule and we will speak to them in respect of the sealift schedule .
the other matters which he raised we will be looking at them .
it has to follow the codes and so on . i will ask my staff to look into that a little more .
i think it has to be kept in mind that there are safety hazards as well , and we have to look at everything before we deal with those matters .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. anawak .
oral questions .
mr. o &apos;brien .
question 92 - 1 ( 2 ) :
proposed power grid to keewatin
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , it is nice to hear the road from the south to the keewatin or nunavut get so much profile .
but there is another issue that is being reviewed and studied and that is the power grid from churchill to arviat and the keewatin in general .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister responsible for the nunavut power corporation , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i am aware of the proposal on the power grid , mr. o &apos;brien has been very articulate over the past couple of years in his support for the power grid .
i haven &apos;t actually read the study , but i can commit to the member to get that information and provide it to him .
the power corporation , we don &apos;t have a nunavut power corporation as such , mr. speaker , indeed it is still the northwest territories power corporation .
that is just for the information of the house .
so i will commit to update the member in this house on the proposed power grid , line or corridor between the province of manitoba and the keewatin region of nunavut .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .

mr. alakannuark .
question 93 - 1 ( 2 ) :
airline schedules in the kitikmeot
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question which i will be posing is to be directed to the minister of transportation .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
yes , thank you mr. speaker .
that is all i can say right now as i still haven &apos;t met with the airline companies .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
oral questions .
mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i understand the ministers &apos; statement but every time i try to go to repulse bay it is impossible without re-routing through somewhere .
i have to go through yellowknife in order to get to repulse and it is very expensive to take that route .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
minister of transportation , mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
i know that the airline companies are aware of the changes in nunavut and the schedules will be changed .
for example the people from kitikmeot , no matter which community they come from whether it be cambridge , taloyoak , gjoa haven , wherever , they have to go through yellowknife .
as nunavut is getting implemented and as we are getting used to our new government i know that there will be better transportation links between the larger centres and more travel between the regions .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
oral question .
mr. kattuk .
question 94 - 1 ( 2 ) :
socio-economic impact of highway construction
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i would like to direct this question to the minister of transportation .
it changes their lives and i know there has been loss of life because when they were travelling down that route they had accidents .
so i guess i am asking the minister if they are to construct a highway from the south , whether they have looked into the matter of socio-economic impacts of the proposed highway .
that is my question to the minister of transportation .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kattuk .
minister of transportation , mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
especially the people who will be impacted will be bringing up a lot of questions , but i am sure it can be brought up at that time .
these are the things that we will have to deal with .
thank you .

thank you mr. anawak .

court challenge to gun control legislation
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i have been pondering the answer the premier gave me in response to my last question and i have another question in regards to the same issue .
earlier he indicated that they are waiting to see the outcome of the legal challenge that is being put forward by the other jurisdictions in canada .
i am wondering , mr. speaker , are we just going to sit and wait to see what happens with that ?
or are we going to file in order to participate and to have our concerns heard there .
are we going to be observers , or are we going to be participants in that ?
thank you mr. speaker .

mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
in respect to the premier .
i know mr. speaker i can review this and i am reviewing this as i speak .
and that &apos;s the usual answer .
how , i guess my question is , in respect to the gun legislation , how much , what has he done , not just a review .
where are the letters that have been written or what are the issues that are dealt with .
i think that these are the types of things we are asking questions about .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you two questions .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
so i just wanted to clarify that mr. speaker .

i think i will rule the questions out of order for the gun bill , because we cannot answer it when it is in the court .

mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. speaker .
the minister of health indicated that the contract was being looked after by the premier &apos;s office and the department of intergovernmental affairs .
i wonder if the premier the premier , if he doesn &apos;t have his information today , if he would commit to provide the terms of reference for this arrangement .
my question would be , would the premier commit to providing this house with the terms of reference for this arrangement and also the time lines .
thank you .
speaker :
before you answer i would like to address something .
yesterday , there was a question made to mr. picco regarding this contract and the name was mentioned .
we do not mention names in here in the house when the person cannot defend himself . i would like to address that .
question was directed to mr. premier .
mr. okalik .
hon. paul okalik :

question 99 - 1 ( 2 ) : pond inlet dock
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i apologize .
this question is directed to the minister of public works regarding the dock that was going to be built in pond inlet .
that was , that project was to have started in 1997 and more work to be done in 1998 with a break in between .
looking at the capital projects , i don &apos;t see this dock being built or maybe the contract was already awarded to build that dock in pond inlet .

mr. tootoo .
question 100 - 1 ( 2 ) :
government contracts made public
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker my question has come about as a result of a comment made by the premier , so i would like to ask him .
he indicated that they wanted to find out whether they could provide contracts , public contracts with government dollars , that information to members of this house .
mr. speaker , i guess that leaves me asking the question .
is this , if they say it is not , does this government have the ability to enter into contracts with people or companies without having that knowledge being made public ?
thank you mr. speaker .

third question mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker in these contracts , i know the government employees fall under the government contracts and are treated in a certain way .

speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .

can we make amendments to the present regulations so that we could alleviate this problem through the nunavut government .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you for your question .

chairperson ( interpretation ) :
are there any other general comments from the members ?
we will just continue on from yesterday so you may ask your questions .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman yesterday i took a look at one of the goals for the department .
having looked them over i saw another one there that i would like to ask the minister about .
the goal of the department is to improve client satisfaction , improve the monitoring and evaluation of community government performance .
mr. chairman i would like to ask the minister and his staff if he can elaborate exactly how they look at doing that or achieving that ?
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister anawak . hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you . the community governments , the hamlet councils have to operate within themselves , independently from the other communities .
as a government we have to watch and monitor them to see if they are operating within their responsibilities .
some municipalities , a majority of the communities , are operating smoothly but some of the communities have debts .
once we start realizing that a community requires assistance , we will try and assist them ahead of time so that they will alleviate most of the problems encountered .
we did not go into detail as to how we can give them further support and how we can monitor the communities .
we want to improve the monitoring and evaluation of community government performance , because if the communities govern themselves they can develop themselves and build capacity to ensure that the communities are prepared .
however we all come from different communities ;
members come from different communities .
we will keep updating you on the new issues coming up .
thank you mr. minister
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :

hon. jack anawak :
we are just developing those and all i can say is that we will improve .
chairperson :
( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
they don &apos;t really have any concrete plans in how they &apos;re going to achieve this goal in dealing with finances and monitoring evaluating , performance .
could the minister or his staff provide us with the time frame as to when they plan on having such policies in place .
thank you mr. chairman
chairperson :
( interpretation ) :
mr. anawak if you wish to answer this or your officials may respond to that .
hon. jack anawak :
( interpretation ) :
yes mr. chairman , we have not developed anything .
we have just started and , again , even if we were to develop anything w e would involve members and the communities .
if we were to unilaterally make a policy we would not meet the needs in the community , we want to involve the communities and the members .
my deputy minister will respond .
chairperson :
( interpretation ) :
deputy minister mike ferris you may proceed .
mr. ferris :
thank you mr. chairman .
one other thing that we are exploring is using the new electronic highway , but we need to have discussions with our partners in the communities .
chairperson :
qujannamiik .
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
the minister indicated that they want to consult with the communities in regards to concerns and issues .
i believe in december there was a conference here sponsored by the department to hear those concerns and stuff .
i &apos;m just wondering , has any of that information been utilized to date in developing policies , law , along these lines and address the issues that the communities expressed at that time .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
( interpretation ) :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak :
( interpretation ) :
yes , regarding those concerns or issues , there has already been discussions on the issues raised by the communities .
we have written to the communities and we will keep these in mind .
in respect to some of the issues , when the conference was held in december , there was still no nunavut government and they raised their concerns , issues and their priorities .
we knew there would be concerns or problems raised and that &apos;s why i &apos;m bringing it up now .
we wish to consult them but in respect to the conference that was held in december and the report , the report has have been sent to every community .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i guess i &apos;m just wondering , you know is there a need to go back and consult was not done during the conference .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
mr. anawak
hon. jack anawak :
the first one is we are going back to quarterly funding for the communities ;
that was a recommendation by the conference .
the other one , a single time zone for nunavut , that were working on now .
chairperson :
( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
mr. tootoo you may ask more questions , however there are other members , so keep that in mind , so i will ask you to ask your last question , mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
is that correct .
thank you mr. chairman

( interpretation ) :
before you answer mr. anawak , mr. tootoo you asked earlier , i know you have more questions after the other members i know you can return to that issue .
mr. anawak
hon. jack anawak :
chairperson :
( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. iqaqrialu
mr. iqaqrialu : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. anawak
hon. jack anawak : ( interpretation ) :
yes , yesterday i believe mike stated something yesterday on the visitations made either from the headquarters or the regional offices .
when he goes to help the communities or when he goes to consult with the communities , we can use that suggestion mr. chairman .
chairperson :
( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu
mr. iqaqrialu : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
there &apos;s three different things if we were to look at these main estimates those are very different from what my community wanted or what they had as their priorities .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. anawak
hon. jack anawak : ( interpretation ) :
i would like to look at how we do the capital planning program , i think there are still some difficulties in it so we need to improve it .
when they submit it to the government it usually returns as a completely different capital plan , because they don &apos;t work together at the same time .
thank you .
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
mr. iqaqrialu do you have further questions or comments .
mr. iqaqrialu : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i really cannot try and challenge them because he states what i want to hear and i hear the proper comments and i &apos;ve been dealing with this issue ever since .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
i really think that was more of a comment , therefore when there &apos;s no question , i want to make a short statement again .
all of us members of the house and also our ministers who are from nunavut and from our communities our constituents are expecting that we were expecting a proper policy .
i know we want to see that as soon as possible , but again the nunavut government is very new and it &apos;s still in infancy and we know were tired of waiting .
even the ministers and i know all the members and our constituents , i know expecting a lot of good things , in order to make the government proceed smoothly .
we know in the future that were keeping the future in mind and what journey will end up , i think we have a clear goal .
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i think that it would be better working relationship between the two , so that was my question mr. chairman .
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. akesuk
hon. jack anawak : ( interpretation ) :
people &apos;s expectations are raised and then they are given a lot less then they thought they were going to be getting .
so i think that it &apos;s best if there &apos;s a closer working relationship between the two governments than things would be able to go forward .
sometimes we just argue about the things that are taken out of the capital plan and if they were well informed we won &apos;t unnecessarily have to go through that debate .
thank you mr. chairman
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
mr. akesuk
mr. akesuk :
i hear that in the keewatin they tried in the communities to have the mayors set up the capital plan or set up the block funding to be given to the mayor .
my question is would you consider giving block funding to the baffin , so that the municipalities could look through it and see what would fit in to their communities .
do you have any such plans in the future . thank you , mr. chairman .
hon. jack anawak : ( interpretation ) :
we &apos;re looking at means to make improvements on how we deal with the governments and how we can work closer together with the municipalities .
chairperson :
for those members who have comments or questions .
mr. mclean your name is next on the list .
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. chairman .
in regards to , i &apos;ll be all over the place here .
in regards to the mdap program where people are eligible from 5 % - 7 % of the purchase price of a house .
my community , as an example , i have heard a lot of potential homeowners and people that purchased houses , and the total inequity of the system .
i have heard stories , i don &apos;t know if they are true or not , that people are getting 120 thousand dollars for the purchase price of a house .
nowhere else in canada , does anyone get 70 % free money for the purchase price of a house .
the average price of a house up here , aside from iqaluit , everywhere else in nunavut , is probably , roughly a three bedroom 1200 square foot bungalow is 200 thousand dollars .
the reason they are not in the subsidized government staff housing is because they don &apos;t work for government , they work for the hamlet or the housing association or things like that .
so i won &apos;t dwell on that much longer , other than that i think it should be looked at .
community empowerment .
but we have an old saying now in places where we have taken over everything , &quot; the government wants to give us all the empowerment we want without the money . &quot;
i don &apos;t think communities should be forced into community empowerment , i think that should be their decisions .
at this point or stage in the game the only thing that baker lake hasn &apos;t taken over , to this point today , is hiring nurses and teachers .
so community empowerment has worked in our community , i think it should be a priority of this government , at the community &apos;s own pace .
it has been a successful endeavour .
this is where it comes to where i hope the government will help more in monitoring and evaluating and training in regards to community empowerment .
i don &apos;t think we are ready for block funding yet but that may be down the road .
i think there is a tremendous , tremendous lack of recognition for elders &apos; housing in communities .
talking with mayors and just people on the street , i know in my community we have four designated elders units and we have over 100 elders .
we are trying to convert single one bedroom units that were designed for single people into elders &apos; residences .
we all know the dark side when elders are living in houses with extended families and the drain on them financially .
sometimes it is not very good what happens to them .
you can comment on this if you like , but it is just statements again .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. mclean .
minister anawak , would you like to make a comment to his statements .
hon. jack anawak :
thank you .
edap is the program which pays a percentage of down payment ; mdap is the program that was put forward by the government of the nwt when it was on its &apos; last legs .
again , these are the kinds of issues that we ran for to try and better serve the residents of nunavut .
if there is a better way to deliver something like edap then i am sure we would take a look at it on how better to serve the people who utilize programs like edap .
if a community wants to go into discussions on community empowerment it should be at their speed instead of us pushing it down their throat .
i have a hard time thinking of these qallunaat sayings , &quot; down their throat . &quot;
it will be at the community &apos;s speed .
so i think it is just a matter of contact and staying in touch with the communities needs and wants , to determine whether we should build an elders &apos; facility or not .
again , knowing that there are certain communities where there are a lot more elders , like qamanittuaq and arviat . these are two communities where there are a lot of elders .
those are the areas where we want to focus since part of the basis for nunavut is respect for our elders .
i think that this is the kind of thing that we can take a look at once we get into the planning for what we are going to do about the issue of housing .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
before anybody speaks i would like to recognize the qwmb and mr. picco &apos;s friend , joanasie akumalik , mr. picco &apos;s constituent .
i would like to welcome you to the assembly .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
this will be my final question mr. chairman , thank you .
mr. anawak on elders &apos; residences and commitments and things like that , i know it is late in the game and we are drawing close .
i think i am correct in saying that in the current budget no money has been designated for elders &apos; residences this year ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. minister .
hon. jack anawak :
there has not been any identified at this time .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
according to the list that i have , mr. alakannuark is next .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
although i forgot what i was going to say , it is more of a comment than a question in regards to housing .
when we are trying to develop a housing program in nunavut , it is very important .
how can the communities give your department more support in public housing .
i know that the budget is very limited .
you stated that you would consult with the communities , i know that you will do that and you will require the assistance and support of the community housing organizations .
in view of that the hamlet councils in the community is the governing body in the community .
for housing maintenance i feel that we could utilize the co-ops to do that housing maintenance because there are so many homeless people in our communities .
i know that we have to work on this issue , for i don &apos;t know how many years .
i just wanted to throw that suggestion out .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
i don &apos;t think this was a question , i think it was more in line of a suggestion for the future .
mr. minister you can respond to it , if you like but i think it was more of a suggestion .
thank you .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
this morning i asked the minister responsible for public works about a docking facility for pond inlet .
i didn &apos;t realize that the transportation department was responsible for that .
so my question is about the docking facility in pond inlet which was proposed in 1977 , with a year off in between .
it was slated to be built in 1999 , this wharf or breakwater .
i don &apos;t see it in the budget estimates , did you move this breakwater to the next year ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. minister .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
when you asked me earlier today i didn &apos;t think i was going to be answering you for the same question .
this was not included in the gnwt budgets .
they had one slated for the qikiqtaaluk , baffin region , a breakwater , this breakwater was slated for pond inlet , but it turned out to be on the b list .
so therefore it is now slated for next year .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
now i understand his explanation so i have no further questions .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
he indicated that these technical positions would be providing assistance to people in homeownership programs .
i am wondering if the minister or his staff could explain why there has been such an about face in that .
also it was mentioned that they didn &apos;t want to be stove piping services .
mr. chairman , i know that previously local housing organizations had only to deal with the housing corporation in every case because the staff housing went through there as well in most cases .
within the department of community government , housing &amp; transportation it has to deal with two different divisions in there , the community government division , and the housing division .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you . mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak :
i would like to answer part of it .
in terms of the other areas , maybe i might get mike to respond to that as well as the technical positions .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
deputy minister mike ferris , you may proceed .
mr. ferris :
mr. chairman , on the first point , the technical people will provide assistance to anybody that asks related to the potential of new homeownership .
that is in their planning stage when they are looking at different designs , different types of programs .
that request stemmed directly from the district offices of the housing corporation and some of the client groups .
that was the basis of getting the technical positions back to provide that type of program assistance to the client group .
in terms of stove piping , when we talk about stove piping , we are talking about individual departments having all the same or duplicated services .
that &apos;s one of the goals of nunavut , is to make it a user friendly type of government .
so , we &apos;re looking at where we can utilize sharing of those types of functions and deliver a good level of service .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about and that &apos;s happening as well across departments .
we have had discussions and we are working with public works and local authorities , housing authorities , to try to make access to technical information and access to the departments easy .
on the break water , usually we get contributions from the year before and i know that it will continue on to this year .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
when we go to the transportation department , you will have that opportunity to talk about that issue under
7 - 13 can you wait till we get to that item .
you could wait till we get to that item mr. iqaqrialu .
at this time we haven &apos;t reach that item yet and you may ask the question to the minister .
if you have any questions in regards to that issue , do you have any other concerns or comments .
no , thank you .
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
this one looking in their information provided to standing committee back last month it shows the total of $ 11 and a half million dollars in salaries for the departments .
the 3 regional functions , the 3 regional offices all together equal only 47 % of those salaries .
mr. chairman i was wondering if the staff can explain why over half of that salaries for the entire department are in the headquarters function and rather than the regional function .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
either the deputy or the minister can respond to him .
mr. anawak
hon. jack anawak :
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
if the headquarter salaries which is just over $ 6 million dollars and the other the 3 regional ones are all two of them under $ 2 million and one just under 3 .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. anawak
hon. jack anawak :
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
no that &apos;s not what i &apos;m getting , i guess what i &apos;m getting at is , we talked about the streamlining of government , becoming more effective , more efficient .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. anawak
hon. jack anawak :
well i &apos;m not too worried about the percentages as long as those people whether they &apos; re headquarters or regional are dedicated to serving the interests of the people of nunavut .
chairperson :
thank you mr. anawak .
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i guess another question is he indicated headquarters in a number of different places in the information that was provided to us last month .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. anawak hon. jack anawak :
( interpretation ) :
thank you , in respect to the staff who are headquarters staff they are there in the communities and also we &apos;re trying to look at ways to save our funds .
they were not in the footprints ii model when i was interim commissioner .
we hired the assistant deputy ministers outside of footprints ii model and because the majority are inuit they &apos;re more aware of inuit culture and language as the government is evolving .
they would travel to cambridge bay or kugluktuk , repulse bay , igloolik or the other communities .
that would lessen the cost of the travel if it were based in rankin inlet .
so again we &apos;re looking for ways to cut down the costs .
mr. chairman mike ferris would like to make an addition .
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
sometimes i forget your name . mr. ferris you may proceed .
mike ferris :
mr. chairman , i just wish to assure the member on this question , we &apos;re not building a bureaucracy .
there has to be some rework of the salary figures but just so the members are aware there are 98 positions regionally and there are 87 headquarters positions .
the regions are already larger than headquarters combined and the minister indicated a number of headquarter positions outside of iqaluit and we will be operating very close to those communities .
we will be working with finance and we started that process just to make sure that the charges we have to capture for housing are clearly identified in one budget area .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ferris .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i would just like to confirm what the deputy minister was saying is that the headquarters amounts for salaries includes all the housing costs for the entire department .
is that what he is saying mr. chairman ?
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. ferris .
mr. ferris :
mr. chairman , i can &apos;t say that it includes all the costs for housing .
i think in that process we have identified a couple of areas where the numbers don &apos;t reflect exactly where the positions are .
that will be sorted out and that will be much clearer once we have had an opportunity to work it through the full process .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
will we be provided with that information at some point in the future ?
because if the information that we have isn &apos;t totally accurate , it would be nice to have the information that is accurate .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
deputy minister ferris .
mr. ferris :
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
now , i am concerned and we are seeing more headquarters positions , leaving here .
i would just like to clarify that .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
in respect to the question posed by mr. tootoo , i believe it &apos;s within 7-4 under the directorate and i believe that it is listed there .
perhaps when we reach that page you can repeat your question at that time mr. tootoo ?
i believe it is on page 7-4 .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
actually mr. chairman , i believe it is the assistant deputy minister for community government .
but as it is , i am not dealing just with that department , it is a departmental headquarters function i am wondering about .
it is not just specifically to that department , it is more of from an overall department that they are moving headquarters positions from out of iqaluit .
i would like some clarification to that .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
deputy minister ferris .
i am sorry minister anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
there will be only one position that will be transferred out .
there is the one position , however , we will look into that and especially with the positions being transferred to the communities .
but as the staff transfers to the communities occurs , we will be dealing with that , but in the meantime there is only that one position is moving .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
i no longer have anybody on my list for questions .
now to get into the main estimates .
as to the members &apos; wishes , do you want to go into the details of expenditures .
starting with 7-4 listed as the directorate .
operations &amp; maintenance .
total operations &amp; maintenance 12 million 255 thousand dollars .
are you agreed ?
some members :
agreed .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
capital items .
total capital , nil .
therefore the total expenditures for the directorate is 12 million 255 thousand .
are you agreed ?
wait a second .
there is a question from one of the members .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman this is the directorate and covers emergency services .
i am wondering if the minister could provide us with some detail in regards to that division .
it is something that there does not seem to be a whole lot of detail or any detail on these services here in the main estimates .
i wonder if he could provide us with that information .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
there is a question in respect to emergency services by a member .
perhaps the deputy minister mr. ferris , can respond .
mr. ferris .
mr. ferris :
thank you mr. chairman .
in the emergency services division there will be eleven py &apos;s .
we have identified special initiative funding of 350 thousand to improve and enhance our fire prevention training .
that is coupled with some additional dollars for general training in the emo .
we are looking at enhancing the preventative side of , whether it is search and rescue , or fire training .
there is a enhanced budget for that in what is being proposed here .
there is also , we want to breakdown the fire training dollars a little better . there is 150 thousand that we will hold in headquarters to allocate to new training initiatives .
we will be offering training for fire-fighters in three levels .
basic fire fighting , fire investigation , and fire command officer training .
that is part and parcel of the directorate operation .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ferris .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
maybe just for clarification , i don &apos;t know if i should ask it here as it is emergency services , or ask it in transportation .
in regards to the services that are going to be developed for the airport . i am just wondering if that is something that is more properly addressed in the transportation part .
maybe i could just ask for some clarification on that .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
deputy minister ferris .
mr. ferris :
in the emergency services branch will also be what was known as the protective services unit for airports .
it will be a combined emergency services unit that responds to all the peacetime emergencies whether they are wind oriented or aircraft oriented .
in the regulatory requirements that is identified as a separate item and it should really be titled instead of ers at 1.3 million , it should be phase 1 regulatory improvements to iqaluit airport .
there is a requirement for us to re-establish ers .
that has done two things , it has changed the level of security requirements at the airport and it requires the return of the ers services .
chairperson :
thank you mr. ferris .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , the assistant deputy minister indicated the return of the ers services .
did we used to have those services in the past and since they have been gone , who was providing them ?
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. deputy minister , mike ferris .
mr. ferris :
mr. chairman . yes there were ers services operating at the airport and they were part of the gnwt deficit recovery , i guess .
what we are looking at is bringing them on in a phased approach and offset as much of the capital outlay with funding from transport canada .
they haven &apos;t given us sufficient funding .
why did the gnwt give us very little ?
there have been cuts in all the existing programs that we have had for a number of years and it causes us problems .
if there are going to be cuts it is not going to be very good .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu thank you .
he &apos;ll get advice from his advisors first .
mr. minister .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
as i said before we grandfathered these from the government of the northwest territories .
once these estimates are approved we can shuffle the numbers around .
it &apos;s a very small number that we are talking about here .
i can &apos;t say directly but i can say that we can shuffle some numbers around .
there was one community that came over and told us that we were supposed to give them some money and it was deferred for another year .
so they were proposing to do whatever project they wanted to do this year and then get reimbursed the following year .
so the communities can do the same thing .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. akesuk .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman i would like to make a motion that we report progress .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :

agreed ?

mr. speaker , i am pleased today to join with my federal colleagues in announcing the royal canadian mint &apos;s launch of a commemorative coin celebrating the creation of nunavut .
as we know , the creation of nunavut on april 1 represented a dramatic change .
on the eve of a new millennium , the people of nunavut began a new journey .
yet , as we embrace our future and all it &apos;s opportunities , we hold fast to our past .
nunavut represents the opportunity for its residents to govern themselves in a way that &apos;s meaningful and sensitive to their rich and diverse culture .
much of that richness , mr. speaker , has been kept alive through the drum , which has long been a tool of communication in inuit culture .
our ancestors used the beat of the drum and the song of drummer to describe our legends and adventures to younger generations .
our heritage is abundant with these stories .
designed by igloolik artist germaine arnaktauyok , the coin portrays an inuit man absorbed in a drum dance .
the drum bears the image of a map outlining nunavut .
inside the map is a qulliq .
ms arnaktauyok , well known for her illustrations in children &apos;s books , reflects in this design her cultural roots .
her talent allows her to capture beautifully her continuing interest in traditional myths and stories as she explores the folklore of her ancestors .
the image of a drummer on this special coin is significant as a symbol to the people of nunavut .
it connects us to our past .
ms arnaktauyok captures the spirit of the drum dancer in this stunning figure which graces the reverse of this newest addition to the mint &apos;s millennium coin series .
ms arnaktauyok says the drum signifies that the people will be heard near and far .
the imagery of the qulliq on this coin is also a strong symbol for the people of nunavut .
traditionally , the seal oil lamp was a source of warmth ;
in the present , it remains a visible link to our past .
we are fortunate and proud to have our symbols recognized through the talents of ms arnaktauyok .
we also welcome the opportunity to share these symbols of nunavut with canada and the world through this special coin .
thank you , mr. speaker .

ministers &apos; statement 21 - 1 ( 2 ) :
information on sole source contract
hon. paul okalik :
thank you mr. speaker .
over the last couple of days , a number of members have raised questions about a sole source consulting contract entered into by the department of the executive &amp; intergovernmental affairs .
i would like to emphasise that this is a service contract , although it has been referred to in this house as an employment contract .
the terms of the consulting service contract fall clearly within section 1.3 of the purchasing guidelines contained in the contracting procedures adopted by the government of nunavut .
the process prescribed in the procedures was followed by the department of the executive &amp; intergovernmental affairs and was approved by the department of public works , telecommunications and technical services .
( pwt &amp; ts ) . this consulting service contract was done on a sole-source contracting basis .
it was made in the following context :
two departments ( pwtts and hr ) do not have deputy ministers
two departments facing major initiatives are significantly understaffed ( health &amp; social services and education )
the headquarter functions of the nunavut public service is staffed at approximately less than 30 % based on information to date .
department of human resources is operating at more than its current capacity to handle the high volume of staffing actions .
for example , an average job advertisement ( and accompanying job description ) is developed and classified through the department of human resources which is estimated to be 1-3 weeks ;
that finalized job advertisement then sent for production which requires 2 weeks for he preparation of the media advertisement ;
upon the closing of the competition each department then screens the applicants , conducts interviews , and within 2-4 weeks the new civil servant is on strength .
the best recruitment time frame estimated by the department of executive &amp; intergovernmental affairs is approximately 8-10 weeks .
employees at all levels have been working beyond the call of duty from the months prior to and since april 1 , 1999 .
his services have been made available to a number of departments based on their needs under the direction of the department of the executive &amp; intergovernmental affairs .
the consulting service contract is short term .
the rate of pay is consistent with the rate of pay at the deputy minister level .
there is no job security .
the consultant is paid on a per day basis .
there are no employment benefits .
the consulting service contract provides the nunavut public service with experience , support and knowledgeable back up in difficult circumstances .
the benefits and the experience of the consultant will be spread out to various departments in the government .
mr. speaker , we in this house have a difficult task in front of us .
we must ensure that there is a smooth transition once the boards of health and education are phased out .
we must ensure that valuable programs and services are in placed for nunavummiut .
mr. speaker , i am pleased that work is underway for this transition .
i am also looking forward to september , when we will have an opportunity to review these transition plans together .
mr. speaker , later today i will be tabling the terms of reference for this contract .

inuuqatigiit curriculum
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker . mr. speaker , i would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge a curriculum document called &apos; inuuqatigiit &apos; which is based on inuit values , beliefs and traditions .
it seems fitting at this time to recognize something that has led the way in using inuit culture as a basis as we establish our new government .
&apos;inuuqatigiit was developed by a steering committee consisting of inuit teachers and teaching and learning centre staff from across the nwt . they consulted elders , educators , and others for the content .
after 3 years of gathering information and developing the document , it began to be implemented in 1996 .
it is the first curriculum documenting inuit culture so it does not contain everything anyone would want to know about inuit .
we have to remember that not all of the beliefs , customs or content pertain to all inuit groups as there are some differences between them .
the document is written in english only but an inuktitut version will be published this spring , which was initiated by the baffin dec , teaching &amp; learning centre .
i am presenting each of the members , a copy of the curriculum document and urge them to visit their schools to find our more about how they are implementing inuuqatigiit .
there are excellent programs and activities run by nunavut educators .
we have a long way to go in resource development but our department is starting to work with the teaching and learning centre staff and the divisional education councils to address this .
mr. speaker , we have a big task ahead of us and the inuuqatigiit curriculum is s major foundation for education .
i would like to thank all the educators who have been involved in the development of the document and particularly the elders who passed on their knowledge and wisdom .
in addition , i would like to acknowledge honourable manitok thompson , minister of public works , telecommunications and technical services who was in on the first development meetings .
the education system as a whole is embracing nunavut &apos;s past and adapting to the future .
inuit values and customs within the school validate that the student &apos;s culture has a place and is affirmed in the school environment .
this is changing in our schools as they become more community-based and are leading the way in this area .
&apos;cultural relevancy &apos; in schools is not just a nunavut issue . the world in general is grappling and trying to deal with diverse cultures within their education systems .
some curricula that is taught in southern canada and other countries are having to be reformed to acknowledge their students who are from diverse backgrounds .
nunavut is privileged to be on the forefront of some aboriginal groups in beginning to establish a school system that is based on its &apos; own roots and history .
our system has changed from one that slapped our hands if we spoke our language and denied culturally who we were .

suicide in nunavut
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i hope that this will come out properly or in the right context so i have to give a little bit of background .
i wish to speak of something that &apos;s occurring in nunavut .
back around 1984-85 or so , in our community , suicides started occurring .
in respect to this issue , mr. speaker , we have all worked hard trying prevent suicide .
i used to be involved with our youth suicide prevention .
we have looked at many options and have debated this issue many times .
in 1985 my older brother committed suicide and just after that my younger brother also committed suicide , and my sister also committed suicide in 1990 and she was the last from my family .
mr. speaker , this issue is something we have touched us all .
how strong we have to be to face this difficult issue .
we have tried to slow the suicide rate , the suicide rate of young people .
and mr. speaker , to date , nobody has been able to find out the real root cause for suicide .
yes , we can assume that they have a specific reasons but a real understanding has never been found to date .
mr. speaker we have to pray for our children , pray that the suicide rates fall .
i have known this from my own experiences .
i still pray for our young people to try and save them .

hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
earlier , the premier talked about this two dollar coin which was designed to commemorate nunavut .
i wanted to add my own comments to that .
germaine arnaktauyok , who did the artwork , was mentioned as the artist that designed this coin .
she is from igloolik and is blandina &apos;s , one of our interpreters , older sister and i also call her my sister .
i think she is referred to as my sister because our mother &apos;s were siblings .
i am very proud of this coin and she &apos;s a tremendous artist and i am very proud of her .
i think everybody here knows her .
she is from nunavut and lived in mr. irqittuq &apos;s riding as she was growing up .
i just wanted to mention this , thank you mr. speaker .

mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
this morning i would like to make a statement to the people of nunavut in respect to the traditional knowledge of the inuit as it relates to the nunavut government .
we have stated we will be closer to the nunavut government .
we keep referring to this and i am very happy that i am dressed in my traditional clothing to make a statement in the house .
the inuit traditional knowledge and wisdom , we have stated that will be our base .
mr. speaker we have heard that we will be a different government and i am very happy that is the case .
it was stated that it was being tested in alberta .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
could you please sit down mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
mr. speaker , i want to add some more comments if that is okay .
i am seeking unanimous consent , i would like to finish my comments .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. puqiqnak is seeking unanimous consent to finish his comments .
are there any nays ?
mr. puqiqnak you have consent to proceed .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
where are the inuit traditional knowledge , it seems that the operations are still like the gnwt of yesterday and we seem to be following that .
our wisdom and our cultural beliefs and values , it seems like they are being sloughed off .
mr. speaker , the nunavut government has to respect their residents .
also mr. speaker , the 36 thousand dollars that was expended for the testing of the gasoline .
just as an example to use that 36 thousand dollars , the damage that was caused , they weren &apos;t even given any part of that 36 thousand dollars .
again , the respect that the nunavut government should have for its &apos; residents , for that seemed to be an aberration from our statements .
again , in respecting our residents , i think we have to stick to that principal .

these islands are in hudson &apos;s bay and james bay .
they &apos;re called long island and bear island , north and south twin islands , akipskie and other islands .
mr. speaker , the premier previously made a statement and i understand that it is dealt with within the land claim agreement , specifically article 15.3.8 .
these islands are a point of contention and they are within the nunavut territory .
i hope that in the future if there is any kind of dialogue about these islands , that the residents of sanikiluaq are involved .

members &apos; statement 71 - 1 ( 2 ) road link to keewatin
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , one of the many ways in which nunavut is unique is the fact that all the territories communities are accessible to the rest of canada only by air and by sea .
we do not have to accept this situation forever .
for example , the province of prince edward island , has recently achieved a mainland link at a cost of some several hundred million dollars .
mr. speaker with enough persistence and strong will , we also can accomplish this , and i believe our premier has these genuine abilities .
mr. speaker , it has been a long time that the keewatin has had the dream of a link between the keewatin and the south .
for many years this dream has eluded us , we talked about studies , restudies , evaluations .
mr. speaker , i think the time has come to act .
mr. speaker this country was brought together by such projects as the cp rail line and the trans-canada highway .
we are linked from east to west , coast to coast , it is now time to focus on north - south ties .
mr. speaker this is a win-win situation for all of nunavut .
the benefits of a permanent road connection are obvious .
reduced transportation costs will save money for fuel , food , housing construction .
the savings in this area will allow more money to be spent on other projects in other regions , such the baffin and the kitikmeot .
mr. speaker , in churchill they receive approximately 7 thousand tourists per year .
these tourists come in to churchill to view the polar bears that migrate into that area and they stop there .
there is no reason why these 7 thousand tourists or a portion of them could not continue on , if we had a road link to the keewatin .
this again will put many dollars back into the communities and provide the tourists with an opportunity to benefit and see the arctic way of life .

hon. manitok thompson :
thank you mr. speaker .
when mr. arvaluk was talking about inuuqatigiit being developed and to be taught to inuit teachers , teaching and learning staff across nunavut .
we do have differing cultures in kitikmeot , baffin and kivalliq .
there are also sub-cultures , paaliqmiut , natilingmiut as well .
the differences in cultures of these people , when we are talking about them , sometimes there are disagreements about what is inuit .
some of the elders may believe that this is a true inuit way but because of the differences in culture , they differ in opinion .
for example in inuuqatigiit , it says that the elders believe that when a woman cannot have a child anymore , if she eats caribou fur she will be able to conceive .
even though inuit share a same language we have different dialects , mr. speaker .
i am very glad to see that this is being developed by education mr. speaker , thank you .

mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
possibly i should have directed my question to the minister of education .
my question that i directed to miss thompson regarding the adult education or the arctic college that was going to be built in cape dorset .
my question is what is the status .
we have already used money for the facility .
speaker :
thank you mr. akesuk .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
i believe it was yesterday that we heard mr. anawak give us his report .
i believe that he was talking about money that was already expended for projects .
the nunavut government has stated that only contracts that were already rewarded are going to go ahead this year .
we are not only talking about drawing designs for buildings , but also health and safety issues , for an example a house that may collapse .
we have to prioritise those projects that have been awarded already .
if your facility does not fall into one of these categories then it will get moved to the next year to be reviewed the following year .
it might mean that the blue print has already been drawn but it does not mean that it is going to get built that year because it does not fall into those categories .
speaker :
thank you , mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk :
the cabinet members have just stated that they will only go ahead with projects that have been contracted out already or health and safety issues .
it could become a safety issue if the school becomes over crowded .
it could become a health and safety issue .
i believe that it should be a part of the review .
mr. speaker : mr. arvaluk , if you would like to respond .
hon. james arvaluk :
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. irqittuq .
question 107 - 1 ( 2 ) :
student teacher ratio
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
this question is for the minister of education .
in my community of hall beach we have a very small school that does not meet the school population and i am sure that is like that in other places in nunavut .
looking at the teachers , what is the teacher children ratio in each classroom .
that is my question .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you , mr. arvaluk
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
our goal is to look at the whole school and not necessarily each classroom .
the teacher student ratio is 19 : 1 . it would be ideal to have 19 students per teacher .
there would be more interaction between the students and the teachers .
but i also know that in some communities there are 30 students per teacher in a classroom .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
mr. mclean .
question 108 - 1 ( 2 ) :
arctic college programs and positions
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question is to the minister of education .
i wonder if the minister can provide me with a time line and when these positions are going to be moved into the various communities in nunavut .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. mclean and mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
i am not sure right now because we are in discussion right now with the arctic college .
we cannot give direction on a daily basis because arctic college has its own board of governors .
it will be a decision of the cabinet if it becomes a money issue .
i can not answer that question until the actual submission or request to the department of education is made is made by arctic college .
if that is the plan then other requirements to clear this plan must be initiated .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk , second question mr. mclean
mr. mclean :
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. mclean , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
yes i will provide that information as soon as possible and in fact i will try to get that information before this session is over .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk , we still have members who want to ask questions .
at this time i will recognize noon hour .
we will break for lunch .
and continue with questions upon our return .
we will recess until 1 : 30 pm .
&gt; &gt; lunch break
speaker :
good afternoon , we &apos;ll go back to our session .
oral questions , item # 6 . we &apos;ve only got 33 minutes for the oral questions at this time .
mr. o &apos;brien you are next .
question 109 - 1 ( 2 ) tendering policy
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker my question is directed to the
mr. premier .
i wonder at this point in times since we are starting off with the new government , if the premier is giving any consideration of reviewing the whole policy as relates to tenders .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. premier
hon. paul okalik :
thank you mr. speaker .
well , like everything we could review it as well , but if you could specify what you would like change that would help .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. okalik .
before i ask you for second question mr. o &apos;brien .
sometimes i &apos;ve seen members , ministers stepping out of this border and that doesn &apos;t look good .
especially with media around here , so i advise you if you have to go out bow to the mace , ask the pages to open the border , thank you .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. speaker , mr. speaker to be more precise i guess as far as the issue of the type tendering that we do are the ways which we got contracts out .
i think when you look at rfp &apos;s and rfq &apos;s and sole source contracting that leaves a number of people out of loop .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. okalik .
hon. paul okalik :

speaker :
oral question , mr. akesuk
question 114 - 1 ( 2 ) marine facility
mr. akesuk :
this capital project was lost in the shuffle , i don &apos;t think nunavut government allocated any money under capital dollars for marine facility .
this is very important program for northerners , as you know probably know 2 years ago gnwt had to cover the cost of lost of the boats .
mr. speaker a lot of the cost could have been prevented if cape dorset had a break water at that time , it was already to go .
i think capital dollars was transferred over to the nunavut government .
are we going to get this project in the near future .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. akesuk .
mr. anawak minister of community government
hon. jack anawak :
( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
yes , i understand his question , i know that most of the communities have requested a breakwater or a wharf and i know that they are in need of breakwater .
if this was slated by the gnwt perhaps nunavut government has put this on the b-list .
speaker :

item 19 :
consideration in committee of the whole of bills and other matters
chairperson ( mr. irqittuq ) ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
hon. jack anawak :
thank you mr. chairman .
the person on my left is mike ferris my deputy minister and on my right michael rafter is our director of finance for community government transportation and housing , thank you .
chairperson :
thank you mr. anawak .
in respect to the yesterdays &apos; meeting , where we had to stop the meeting , we were dealing with 7-5 , i believe we were supposed to get back to 7-5 .
just underneath it total operations and maintenance $ 35 million 9 hundred 22 thousand are you agreed .
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman yesterday on the last remarks , i believe another member from the baffin was asking about the project in the community .
the minister indicated , he said that the capital funding went to the prove , it could be shuffled around after .
thank you mr. chairman .
hon. jack anawak :
they want to delay a particular project and move up the arena and with the money that was allotted for the capital they want to prioritise the hockey arena .
if that &apos;s the case i could tell the financial management board we could put it back to the financial management board and move it to a different project .
i used kimmirut as an example as to their priorities and that &apos;s what i was referring to .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo has that answered your question ?
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
i thought i did ask the question .
then the minister is saying that once capital dollars have been committed they can be moved from one project to another . in other words adding new projects to the capital plan .
is that what the minister is indicating ? thank you mr. chairperson .
no . we will not produce more finances but with regard to the community of kimmirut , their priorities and their allotted capital plan for this year are not the same ;
chairperson :
thank you mr. anawak .
just kidding .
hon. kelvin ng :
mr. chairperson , maybe just to put some clarity to the issue in respect to how departments deal with their budgets .
there are regulations obviously surrounding that and if the financial management board approves it , the supplementary appropriation for that move comes back to the assembly for a vote .
that &apos;s the process in place .
thank you .
there is nothing that could be done without members being involved in that decision even though it may be after the fact in respect to government priorities .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo , do you understand now the process to change the priorities .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
i have nothing to add mr. chairperson .
just kidding .
in respect to page 7.6 the bottom , the bottom detail , the garbage packer for the pond inlet total .
i &apos;m not sure what it &apos;s really geared towards and i would like to understand what the garbage packer is .
because in inuktitut this states that it &apos;s a garbage box in inuktitut .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
perhaps minister anawak will answer that .
continue mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
this is a garbage truck , which opens up and compacts the garbage .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s supposed to be .
that &apos;s what it is in actuality .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you for giving a good answer .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
my list of names in respect to baffin details are gone .
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
i might make a mistake mr. chairperson .
i would like to move to 7-8 .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. puqiqnak we &apos;re almost there .
if you can be patient .
i don &apos;t think there are any more questions in respect to the baffin total capital .
detail of capital the total , the baffin total is 5 million 718 thousand .
are you agreed ?
in respect to the keewatin region , the keewatin total is 3 million 903 thousand .
are you agreed ?
agreed .
the kitikmeot total is 1 million 163 thousand .
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
i &apos;m kind of confused here .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
at this point we &apos;re on 7-8 in respect to the kitikmeot total .
the detail capital , the keewatin region total was already agreed and that &apos;s on 7-7 .
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
hold on mr. puqiqnak .
be patient .
they &apos;re looking for your concern .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
i will ask my deputy minister to respond to the question .
chairperson :
mr. ferris .
mr. ferris :
there were no projects specifically in gjoa haven other than we &apos;ve got some independent housing .
there is an access road and those are the two from our department in gjoa haven .
education and health has projects .
the other ones mr. chairperson , may be ones that would be found in the nunavut incremental infrastructure because that &apos;s one of the impacted communities .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. puqiqnak .
do you have additional comments ?
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i &apos;m aware that in year 1999 - 2000 the community had prioritized their projects for those years .
after we were in parish hall , like i said , i wanted to see that project happen before i lost all may hair .
i said that in parish hall .
but there is nothing under nunavut community government .
because the community is also looking for projects but there are not projects planned for 1999 - 2000 .
they &apos;re not on the list at all .
that &apos;s why i wanted to know what actually was happening in gjoa haven .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
jack anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
i &apos;m sorry .
we want to get everything completed before you lose all your hair too but at this time i apologize that it &apos;s not for this year .
it has been put off for the fiscal year .
it was put over to the next year because there needs to be some planning done . ... had to be drawn up .
that &apos;s all i &apos;m able to respond to you at this time .
perhaps when we go to gjoa haven we will be able to meet with the hamlet council .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
also i don &apos;t see any projects for pelly bay .
the school in our community received a letter .
i &apos;d seen a letter about that 1998 to year 2000 .
there is nothing slated for that community about the school .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. alakannuark .
so , if you could be patient .
i think they &apos;re searching for what you are talking about .
i &apos;m sorry .
you were talking about the community hall ?
mr. alakannuark :
thank you mr. chairman .
i &apos;m talking about the school gymnasium .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
perhaps the minister of education can further clarify you on that but there are no funds .
no funds have been identified this year for specifications for the school gymnasium .
mr. alakannuark did you want to ask another question ?
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman , that &apos;s all i had .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
just for a point of clarification .
are we on community government right now ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. o &apos;brien , we &apos;re on community government .
projects kitikmeot .
keewatin was already passed .
we are now on kitikmeot section .
you understand now ? mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
mr. chairman , is it possible to go back to one issue under the keewatin i have a question on that .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. o &apos;brien wants to return to keewatin .
do you agree ?
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman and colleagues .
under the keewatin under nuvuk residential subdivision 1.6 million dollars .
i wonder if the minister could be so kind as to give some details or rationale as to what this project entails .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. anawak .
mr. ferris .
mr. ferris :
thank you mr. chairman .
a year ago there was a new subdivision opened up in rankin inlet .
there was buried pipe put in the ground .
so we &apos;re honouring that commitment in terms of the loan that rankin inlet got to do the full subdivision and to reimburse them for what would have been the territorial government &apos;s share .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
so basically this money is already spent and the work is already completed .
is this expenditure primarily for utilidor work or is it actual land assembly ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. ferris .
mr. ferris :
under the agreement or under the policy that the territorial government had for lot development there was an average lot price established and think it was around about 50 thousand dollars .
for example , in kimmirut , because of the hill structure there , the lots are very expensive .
so there has been a subsidy that &apos;s been provided out of the capital plan dollars for developmental lots in that community .
buried pipe lot development is very expensive there as it is here in iqaluit .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
this policy , that it seems to me that , i guess cut and dry , somewhat flexible .
are you saying this policy applies for the people here in iqaluit ?
that there is funding available to subsidize the price of lots but it varies from community to community ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. ferris .
mr. ferris :
that is how the policy has been applied .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. anawak , this is your question .
hon. jack anawak :
if he wants to get the fairly good , accurate , dollar amounts then if he can just bear with me , we &apos;ll get the information .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
last one , mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
can the minister tell me what the policy is for installing utilidor services in the other communities .
is there a reason why you just can &apos;t have utilidor service , why it has to be only in iqaluit , rankin , and who ever else might have it .
is it in within your policy to expand this beyond these communities ?
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak :
you have to understand that , mr. chairman , we &apos;re less than two months old and we haven &apos;t developed a policy .
the policies that we inherited are from the government of the nwt and at this point in time that &apos;s the policy we &apos;re following .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
since this was your last one mr. o &apos;brien .
go ahead however .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
i appreciate that .
that did not quite answer my question .
mr. chairman , i was asking what the policy is in relationship to hooking up other smaller communities , putting them on the utility system .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. ferris .
mr. ferris :
that &apos;s why it &apos;s only in limited communities and mainly in taxed based where they have the ability to raise the additional dollars to cover the costs .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. tootoo are you asking about keewatin or do you want to go back to the baffin region or keewatin ?
we are currently under keewatin .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i know exactly where we are .
i think projects or any of the capital any member from anywhere should be able to ask if it effects the capital for the whole territory in this department .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. ferris .
mr. ferris :
mr. chairman we can provide the member with the cost but that was a project by the territorial government .
i &apos;ll have to go back to the files to get that .
it seems to me that the cost of land development was close to 3 , 3 and one half million dollars but i will produce the information .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo . please make your question clear .
mr. tootoo :
i thought i did mr. chairman .
but i &apos;ll try and do better .
thank you .
could the minister also again , i &apos;m looking for that information , he indicated that this cost was this year &apos;s share .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. ferris .
mr. ferris :
mr. chairman there is no work going on in nuvuk subdivision this year .
the project was complete .
this is a contractual arrangement and that &apos;s why when we use the criteria it fit within the criteria .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman the minister also said that the policy allowed for what the government can consider .
i know there is three communities in nunavut with utilidor , iqaluit being one of them .
has the policy been used and considered in other communities especially here in iqaluit .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. ferris .
mr. ferris :
for example if that was done in iqaluit if they wanted to use old funds for a project the government can look at it to see how much we can help them out with .
does that answer your question ?
mr. tootoo :
thank you .
i guess what i was asking is has this policy been used or will it be used in the cost of the lots being developed here in iqaluit .
the new lots up the hill are when i first saw the price up around 70 thousand dollars per lot .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
we &apos;ve already dealt with baffin region .
we were in keewatin , and then we asked to go back to keewatin and we &apos;re just dealing with that one question right now .
perhaps mr. tootoo you can have your own private meeting now that is done but however i &apos;ll let mr. ferris respond .
mr. ferris :
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
does that answer your question ?
maybe you should take some inuktitut lessons so that when you are bilingual it would be easier for you to understand everything .
let &apos;s go back to our item on hand .
do i have to ask for agreement again ?
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
i don &apos;t know if this is a final order , mr. chairman , or not but i don &apos;t appreciate the comments that were just made by the chairperson .
i take exception to those comments and i would sincerely hope that the chairman would look at the rules of the house and make sure that they &apos;re followed by everybody .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
since i &apos;m the chairperson we &apos;re trying to keep order and we &apos;re trying to get ahead and that &apos;s why i made those comments .
do we have to get an agreement to go back our normal item ?
keewatin total , 3 million 903 thousand , do you agree ?
and now to get back to 7-8 , capital for kitikmeot , total 1 million 163 thousand .
agreed ?
for all of nunavut , capital total 50 million .
agreed ?
community government total capital 10 million 833 thousand .
to go back to 7.5 , total capital 10 million 833 thousand .
agreed ?
total expenditures 46 million 755 thousand . 7-9 , housing .
operations and maintenance , total 33 million 243 thousand .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i &apos;d like to ask the minister if the funding to those organizations has stayed the same , increased or decreased and how these numbers relate to last year .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak :
mr. chairman , by and large , the funding has stayed the same as the previous year and the funding usually is derived per capita .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman . mr. chairman , i &apos;d like to know if it has gone down over the last year .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. ferris .
mr. ferris :
i just want to clarify .
the minister &apos;s correct .
at the present time , we &apos;re paying the municipality or the local housing authorities on the basis of the figures that came from the gnwt .
there is , if the main estimates are approved , there is 1 million in forced growth funding for local housing operations that has not been apportioned yet to those local housing operations .
and until the budget is approved we &apos;re not able to tell them to spend that money .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. deputy minister for that response .
i &apos;m pleased to hear that and i &apos;m sure that the associations in the communities will be , too .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson : mr. ferris .
chairperson : mr. tootoo .
thanks mr. chairman .
i guess all of them .
what percentages in each region the reduction over last year as a result of this transfer .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. anawak
hon. jack anawak :
actually , the reductions should be proportionate to the number of personnel leaving in terms of going into the public works department .
so , it should be just proportionate to the number of people leaving .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i realize that but i asked if we could get a percentage in decreased in regional budget due to this transfer .
i don &apos;t see how difficult that is to answer .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. anawak
hon. jack anawak :
yes , we can get the information and we &apos;ll get it .
i &apos;m just saying that it &apos;s not a decrease .
it &apos;s just a transfer of the funds to public works in order to facilitate the transfer of technical people to public works from the housing corporation .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
so , i &apos;m just going to clarify and make sure i have it straight .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. anawak
hon. jack anawak :
yes , basically , that &apos;s right with the exception that when the transfer occurred i guess there was about 4 or 5 vacant positions that have not been factored into the budget .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
any further questions ?
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
may i just clarify again because i &apos;m not sure where the dollars coming in from the cmhc , do they flow through this area or they show up in a different area .
i &apos;d just like to ask for some clarification on that .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. ferris .
mr. ferris :
mr. chairman , the dollars coming in from cmhc do not show up in this section .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ferris .
i have another name on my list .
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
just for further clarification , mr. chairman .
regarding the grants and contributions .
what falls under grants and contributions and how do you get grants and contributions ?
mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. ferris .
mr. ferris :
the other o &amp; m is used for travel , transportation costs , office supplies within the housing corporation operations .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you for that clarification and i would also like clarification on the contributions .
how do you apply ... what contains contributions .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
would anybody like to respond , mr. anawak ?
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
i apologize .
i didn &apos;t look at the inuktitut ... i believe you &apos;re talking about the grants and contributions in 7-9 and it &apos;s contributions totalling 19 million .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
we &apos;re not there yet .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
well , it &apos;s under housing .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
please use the chair , mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
mr. chairman , i apologize .
i forgot that we were at the assembly .
i am here in 7-9 and i &apos;m talking about contributions in the same page .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. puqiqnak , if you could identify the number .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
mr. chairman , i &apos;m getting very confused . it &apos;s 7-9 under housing .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
mr. anawak
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
i apologize .
it &apos;s for homeowners &apos; assistance or some of the forms are assistance for housing .
i apologize to you , mr. puqiqnak .
you mentioned 19 million and little bit under .
it &apos;s the regional housing , baffin , keewatin and kitikmeot which totals up 19 million and 50 thousand which would be contributed .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman and mr. minister for responding to my question .
i can use an example in uqsuqtuq .
there &apos;s a person who would like to build a house with his own design but he can &apos;t do that .
it creates a problem for the inuit , this policy .
even myself , if i were going to be spending money to build a house i would want that house built the way i want to see it .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
mr. anawak
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
i have heard of this concern and the department has actually talked to that person .
we &apos;re working on it but i think that we have to review it again .
we have to find out where these houses come from , if they are arctic-proof and we have to look at the policy again .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you and i also thank the minister .
looking at nunavut it &apos;s very large geographically and we are representing our ridings , the communities in our ridings .
well , i understand exactly where you are coming from and he said that they &apos;re going to review the policy and i will be looking forward to the results of the review .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
please realize that if you have any questions please keep to the specific page number .
mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk :
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kattuk .
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , in the o &amp; m function there &apos;s salaries and wages that those costs reflect all the staff related to the nunavut housing corporation .
does that include , the , include all the staff that are being hired in the office in arviat ?
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak :
yes .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , could the minister or his staff inform us , i know during the standing committee meeting it was indicated they were having some problems filling some of those positions .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. anawak
hon. jack anawak :
yes .
on the controller , he started 2 weeks ago and on the rest we &apos;re proceeding according to our schedule .
we &apos;re proceeding to get employees for the department , according to the schedule that we set .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
has this been addressed or is there any plans on negotiating with cmhc on the agreement as far as some changes to it or is there any plans .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak :
it has effected schooling , health and justice issues .
but cmhc money is going to gradually decrease .
this social housing money will gradually decrease over the years .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
did you get that mr. tootoo ?
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i &apos;m just wondering if you can clarify those .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. ferris .
mr. ferris :
mr. chairman , thank you .
the minister is right that cmhc is no longer involved in social housing .
that decision was made .
all the agreements that are currently in place are identical in every province and territory .
with the provinces and territories and , we have been involved , i &apos;m on the council of deputy ministers that have responsibility for housing .
our minister will be also attending the meeting , hopefully in whitehorse , with other ministers responsible for housing in the provinces and territories .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , the deputy minister said that the federal government is not responsible , they are no longer in social housing .
does that mean that we , as the nunavut government are the ones that are responsible for social housing in nunavut ?
he indicated that they transferred their responsibility over to us , it &apos;s something that basically if we looked at it , if we addressed it , it would sink us .
if they &apos;re going to dump that responsibility on us there has to be some way of going back after the federal government , because it was their responsibility to begin with .
i don &apos;t know if we &apos;ve been transferred that responsibility .
but i still think that there should be some responsibility for that in ottawa .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
like i stated yesterday , i had a meeting with the cmhc minister .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
i have two people on my list and then we &apos;ll take a break .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i am waiting for approval of the estimates because the people from my community are stuck right now while we are working on them .
if you have clarifications and so on we are going to have four years to digest all this information .
i would like to move ahead with the approval of these main estimates and of course i will have questions when the appropriate time comes , but i will keep them brief .
i just wanted to make that statement .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
that was just a comment .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
we have oral questions again tomorrow , when we can ask those questions .
i would like to get back to the main estimates to deal with them line by line .
i am sure there will be every opportunity to ask your questions .
i would like to go ahead with the main estimates and go line by line .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
that was just a comment .
since i don &apos;t have any more names on my list , let &apos;s go back to 7-9 .
total operations &amp; maintenance 33 million , 243 thousand , agreed ?
some members :

some members :

chairperson ( interpretation ) :

mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i guess that we had agreed on the individual totals , i just have a question on the overall total , should i ask that now or when we get to it ?
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
yes , we will go down to it , to the whole nunavut total , you may ask your question then .
kitikmeot total 1 million 9 thousand , agreed ?
nunavut total 16 million 160 thousand .
agreed .
some members :

chairperson ( interpretation ) :

chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman on the capital for housing , i just want to ask the minister how this reflects on previous year &apos;s capital delivery throughout nunavut .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
yes , when the budget was set for housing this year is 20 million dollars shorter than the previous years .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
then the minister is saying it is half of the capital that housing had last year .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. ferris .
mr. ferris :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman the minister took the first question to mean historically what was spent and it is about 20 million less than what the gnwt historically spent on housing .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
does that answer your question mr. tootoo , or would you like to ask another question .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i will try and clarify .
what the deputy minister is saying is that there is a 10 - 15 million dollar reduction in capital from your first budget that was put forward .
is that what the deputy minister is saying ?
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. ferris .
mr. ferris :
mr. chairman , just give me one second and i will give you the information .
chairperson :
thank you mr. ferris , mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
there is none .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
yes , i apologize , in respect to the issue we just discussed .
the programs and projects that we were talking about are just continuing from the gnwt but the new money is 15 million 960 thousand .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. ferris do you have a comment .
mr. ferris :
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
does that answer your question , mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
in regards to the ministers &apos; comment . 15 million 960 thousand , for example i had asked a question to this effect a couple of days ago about taloyoak .
i asked the minister of sustainable development when you were touring the communities , the 15 million dollars , if you are going to be allotting some funds to taloyoak .
will taloyoak get part of this money ?
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
yes , as i have stated before , the ones that we just discussed are already existing programs .
yes , if we are going to be working with the community , yes they will get some funding from that .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. chairman .
a couple of brief questions .
when the housing corporation is determining how they put retrofits in communities , and looking at this one , 100 % of the retrofits for this year went into two communities .
the baker lake housing association was taken over by the hamlet council .
one of the conditions of taking it over was that they do condition ratings on all the units and there are roughly 285 public housing units .
the hamlet did a condition rating and roughly 40 - 50 units were below 50 % .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. ferris .
mr. ferris :
there are various things that they would look at related to the retrofit , the plumbing in the unit , the electrical service and so on .
i could provide a more detailed process to the member , but i don &apos;t have that entire file with me this afternoon .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
could you please shut off your microphone every time you are finished speaking .
thank you .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , in regards to the overall reduction in the budget for housing .
chairperson :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak :
thank you .
the maintenance will be maintained through the o &amp; m , so it doesn &apos;t affect the maintenance .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i know the minister indicated that it is through the o &amp; m so there shouldn &apos;t be any effect .
can the minister tell me whether there is a decrease , whether it is under the o &amp; m or whatever other category , for the maintenance on housing .
is there a decrease this year as opposed to last year ?
chairperson :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak :
no , there shouldn &apos;t be , because we also have to take a look at the 1 million that has to be distributed throughout the housing associations .
so there shouldn &apos;t be any decrease in the o &amp; m grants to housing associations .
chairperson :
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
can the minister commit to that ?
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. ferris .
mr. ferris :
mr. chairman , thank you .
that would be one of the areas that we would be looking at using the additional dollars .
as was indicated earlier there were some reductions made in the past by the gnwt and we have been contacted by two or three of the local housing organizations that have identified that .
the minister has committed to have our housing people review those discrepancies in their funding and see whether there is any opportunity to equalize some of that lost revenue .
the figures that we are using right now simply flow out of what the gnwt was paying them as of march 31st last year .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
that &apos;s my point exactly and i appreciate the concern the minister is demonstrating towards this critical issue .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
i apologize for making inappropriate remarks at times .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i apologize too if i made any inappropriate remarks , we can leave that behind us .
thank you .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. ferris .
mr. ferris :
mr. chairman , i do have a regional breakdown , just let me check with mr. rafter to see whether we have a running total on the regional breakdown .
i have it by program just let me see if we have it on one of these documents .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
he is still looking for his document i guess .
mr. ferris :
mr. chairman sorry for the delay , there are too many pieces of paper here , that &apos;s why there are no trees left in this part of the country .
in terms of the breakdown of the capital , kitikmeot is slated to get 5 million 45 thousand , kivalliq , 5 million 235 thousand , baffin 8 million 708 thousand .
those figures i have just given include the main estimate sheet with the carryover amounts .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i would like to ask the minister if he could provide us with a copy of the regional breakdown of new capital for the regions .
i would like to know if he could provide that for us .
also i would like to know if he could provide a further breakdown through the programs that those dollars are going to be put towards .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak :
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you minister .
that they have something to take home and be able to clearly indicate what new dollars they will have to deliver in their communities .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
thank you .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i was going to ask a question in regards to how much capital is going to be slated for the baffin region but it has already been answered .
so therefore i have no further questions as long as pond inlet will be included .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
that was more of a comment .
yes we &apos;ll go on housing , total capital 19 million 60 thousand , are you agreed .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i have to now , i realize , talking on that question the member from arviat raised earlier , on the finances going to maintenance not to communities .
just wondering , i know the whole formula that &apos;s used for financing the associations .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. anawak
hon. jack anawak : ( interpretation ) :
yes , we will review the issues that have caused some problems , so we can improve and we &apos;ll look into it .
thank you mr. chairman
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
does that answer your question .
housing total capital 19 million 60 thousand , mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
we felt they were not allotting the funds evenly , so i feel that the government of nunavut should contribute the funds evenly to nunavut communities .
the government has stated that they would do away with the regions and they would look at the nunavut government as a whole .
i don &apos;t wish to see the department contributing or allotting funds unevenly , so therefore i &apos;m urging your department to contribute funds more evenly to the communities .
thank you
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
yes , in kitikmeot the 1 million 9 thousand was already existing and that just carries over .
we will focus on nunavut as a whole but budget was from the previous year .
thank you
chairperson :
mr. puqiqnak
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman , this is the first time that nunavut government is starting to deal with main budget estimates .
gnwt had quite a huge responsibility prior to nunavut becoming real .
some of their funds in the main estimates are also including gnwt previous expenditures , so i did not expect to see any allotted for housing .
let &apos;s try and notice that the gnwt had a huge task with the whole territory , but this is now nunavut .
thank you .
that was just a comment .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i &apos;m sorry let &apos;s go back to 7-9 total capital $ 19 million 60 thousand .
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. anawak
hon. jack anawak :
yes .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i have no more people on my list , the total capital $ 19million 60thousand do you agree . agreed .
the total expenditures are $ 52 million 303 thousand are you agreed . agreed .
in respect to transportation , the operations and maintenance , the total in maintenance $ 15 million 867 thousand , are you agreed . agreed .
open the page to 7-13 in respect to transportation , the detail of capital in respect to baffin region total is $ 5million 91thousand , do you agreed .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
in regards to the capital for transportation , i believe this includes access roads and i know that is a priority with this department .
with the gnwt it was not such a high priority because they had access over in the west by roads .
i &apos;m wondering mr. chairman , will access roads become a high priority for the department in looking at their future capital .
thank you mr. chairman
chairperson :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. anawak
hon. jack anawak :
i just wondered if the member might elaborate a little more on the description of an access road .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i &apos;m just wondering does that clarify , what i mean by access roads .
thank you mr. chairman
chairperson :
mr. anawak
hon. jack anawak :
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
in respect to the capital that was set for clyde river .
i would like to bring these up based on the details .
i used to be a hamlet councillor and we dealt with the capital plan planning exercise while we were still under gnwt .
we had an agreement with the gnwt and i will bring these to light .
especially one detail just to make it clear , the construction of the community break water .
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu , you can raise the question you have under another area .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
no it &apos;s in there , i &apos;m really in the detail
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
we wanted to get in to detailed capital for the baffin region or are we not on this issue .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
yes , we are but we &apos;re not talking about details not listed , we &apos;re dealing with the detailed capital .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i &apos;m trying to talk about the money allotted , if you would let me finish please i would really thank you very much .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu perhaps when you &apos;re not holding up the other members .
maybe if you ask the questions you &apos;ll get the proper responses .
please don &apos;t read the whole part .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman , i was just trying to clarify an issue .
when it gets within the detailed capital in the baffin region they have allotted 175 thousand dollars .
i &apos;m wondering why they have cut the figure from 250 thousand , that was promised by the gnwt and now it &apos;s 170 thousand .
the reason why i wanted to talk about this was because it would cause a problem .
the agreement we had already with the gnwt was transferred to the government of the nunavut to be dealt with and it was 250 thousand at that time .
well we had an agreement for the capital plan with the gnwt but it &apos;s now 175 thousand , so there &apos;s 75 thousand dollar discrepancy and that &apos;s not clear .
i just wanted to ask why and thank you mr. chairman for allowing me to finish .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. anawak
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
yes , the 175 thousand was transferred from the gnwt .
chairperson :
thank you mr. anawak .
mr. iqaqrialu
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
yes , we did not get the 250 thousand , we got the contract for 250 thousand dollars and it wasn &apos;t 175 thousand dollars .
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
we were supposed to follow it for five years and we had an agreement through the government .
i &apos;m getting kind of sweaty here , thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak :
thank you mr. chairman .
i &apos;m sorry , i apologize , but i had just heard that it was 175 thousand dollars .
yes they requested 250 thousand , but the 175 thousand was allotted this year .
but i think you have to be aware that we were dealing with the main estimates .
there are a lot of things on the community wish list , which were not placed here when we were looking at a five-year plan for all of the communities .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman , i want to know how long is the plan deferred to construct the community breakwater .
i would like to understand that perhaps i could state now , for the five years that we &apos;ve planned to construct the breakwater the funding has been cut .
now are we to assume that we will have to deal with the community breakwater over 7 years in order to meet the rest of the construction ?
perhaps mr. anawak , the minister of transportation did state that he wanted to have a meeting with me and i &apos;m sure that will succeed .
perhaps if we come to an understanding over these details and i really do want to finish and deal with the agreement of the detail capital .
chairperson :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. anawak
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
: thank you mr. chairman .
perhaps in order to make him understand more clearly we &apos;ll get mike ferris to comment .
chairperson :
mr. ferris .
mr. ferris :
that , like in other communities , hadn &apos;t been signed off .
there is actually more work to be done and there is 125 thousand that came as carry-over , which again is only the 44 cent dollars .
so there should have been twice that amount but we only got , through the division of assets and liabilities , 44 cent dollars .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
i will keep these brief mr. chairman .
because of that reason i will stop here .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. minister . mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
yes , i am sorry but i think we might be mistaken as well , because if there really was a contract in relation to that project we would have to undertake a review .
perhaps i could commit that we will look into the matter and discuss the matter with the member from clyde river .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
we are still in the detail of capital for the baffin region .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i don &apos;t know if the minister is aware , if i could ask him , two years ago there was a harbour study done here in iqaluit .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :

we could do that together as one committee .
if the minister could speak to that briefly i would appreciate it .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak :

i think you may notice that we had already agreed to the regional breakdowns , but there is a 1 dollar discrepancy , i just wanted you to notice that .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
i believe the finance minister made that mistake ;
we are not to blame .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
we do not have the finance minister present how are we to proceed here .
minister mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak :
yes perhaps one was rounded off to 870 thousand and the other added up to 71 , so we will blame the finance minister for this .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
perhaps the finance minister could correct that discrepancy .
the figure in 7 - 12 and the figure in 7 - 14 have a slight 1 thousand dollar discrepancy .
finance minister , mr. ng .

&gt; &gt; committee recessed at 4.30 and resumed at 4.47
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you for coming back .
following through with our agenda , we are going to deal with culture , language , elders &amp; youth .
we have the minister of culture , language , elders &amp; youth .
we can begin with this department .
minister havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak :
thank you mr. chairperson .
the department of culture , language , elders &amp; youth is a new department within the nunavut government .
the creation of this department was recommended by the nunavut implementation commission in its &apos; footprints ii report .
our mandate and services are unique and found nowhere else in canada or for that matter in the world .
the department is responsible for youth , elders and women &apos;s issues , providing a vital link between the people and the government .
language , translation and interpretation services for the nunavut government are one of our key central department roles .
our central department roles include managing the territorial archives and ensuring government is compliant with the archives act and the official languages act .
currently , the department is staffed by just over 90 % inuit members , which exceeds the government of nunavut inuit employment target and we are very proud of this achievement to date .
our department has maximized its &apos; decentralized plan with only the deputy minister &apos;s office and the policy and planning unit located in iqaluit .
our culture , elders &amp; youth division is headquartered in igloolik and our language division is headquartered in iqaluktuuttiaq ( cambridge bay ) .
i am sure you will agree that the presence of our department will have a positive impact on the economic status of these two communities .
it will also be easier for the local people to visit and discuss their concerns with the officials staffed by senior personnel .
the department of culture , language , elders &amp; youth budget is 6 million , 200 thousand dollars which includes resources to look after the status of women portfolio .
the budget of the department includes the funding for many language services that have government wide applications , as well as funding support in the form of grants and contributions to the nunavut public .
at present the dept is tasked with distributing just over 2 million 400 thousand dollars in grants and contributions to individuals , organizations and local governments .
the budget of the department is organized into five categories .
the deputy ministers &apos; office , policy / finance unit , women &apos;s issues , language bureau and the culture , elders and youth division .
the deputy minister &apos;s office is responsible for the overall management of the department and has a recommended budget of 285 thousand , 600 dollars .
the policy / finance unit is responsible for the analysis of all departmental policies and provides policy , planning and financial advice and services to the departments &apos; senior managers .
this unit has a budget of 357 thousand , 400 dollars .
the status of women &apos;s portfolio provides senior management with advice and guidance regarding women &apos;s issues in nunavut .
the budget of this unit is 637 thousand 200 dollars .
the language bureau is tasked to provide all government departments with translation and interpretative services as requested .
we are also developing the nunavut government &apos;s language policy .
they are also responsible for the administration of the official languages act and make recommendations on the telecommunications and radio / tv activities within smaller communities .
the budget of this bureau is 2 million 88 thousand 600 dollars .
the culture , elders &amp; youth division is responsible for managing the cultural , heritage and artistic health of the territory .
the division is the key link between government and nunavut &apos;s youth , elders and artists .
the division is also responsible for providing direction and planning on issues facing the conservation and protection of nunavut &apos;s heritage and culture .
we are working to incorporate inuit qaujimajituqangit ( inuit traditional knowledge ) into the government of nunavut .
the implementation of iq is being done with our nunavut partners , mainly the nunavut social development council .
soon , we will be meeting with all the cabinet members to promote iq in the government civil service .
the division co-ordinates the territory &apos;s archaeology activities , archaeology-permitting process , historical records and grants authority of official place names and / or titles .
the division is home for the nunavut archives and it administers the archives act .
the budget for this division is 2 million 892 thousand 900 dollars .
the formation of the nunavut arts council is continued from the former nwt arts council .
its role will be to recommend to the minister of culture , language , elders &amp; youth on issues relating to cultural activities and artistic needs of nunavut .
the role , mandate and tasks given to the department of culture , language , elders &amp; youth is vast and diverse .
it is a new mandate that is maturing and developing daily and which deals with complex issues and matters of culture , heritage and language .
each day our department faces new challenges and hurdles in developing , staffing and leading this new government department .
we have been tasked to ensure that the government complies with its legal obligations under the archives act , yet we have no facility to accomplish this .
nor do we have the capital dollars to build or plan this required facility .
we are tasked to ensure our heritage art , artifacts and significant pieces of the past are well documented and stored in nunavut for the use and pleasure of all people .
however , we have no facility or capital dollars to build a heritage centre to store the people of nunavut &apos;s art and artifacts .
our past is kindly stored , mr. chairperson , by the government of the nwt in yellowknife .
not available for our people to see , not available for our youth to learn from , not available for our elders to teach with .
i am sure all members here today would agree that we gain nothing as a government by keeping the precious work of our ancestors and elders out of reach of our people .
our goals are clear , mr. chairperson , however , so are our limitations .
i would like to conclude my comments by echoing the findings issued this week by the standing committee that recently reviewed our mandate , business plan and budget .
we clearly do not have the financial resources to adequately address or accomplish the tasks that have been given to us .
we look for the support of our members and their advice in helping us to map out new ways to do our business and complete our goals .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
minister havioyak would you like to ask your staff to come to the witness table ?
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
yes i will be asking my deputy minister , peter irniq , and also mark bain , our director of finance , please come to the table .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
welcome mr. irniq and mr. bain .
right now we will begin .
mr. alakannuark do you have any comments , do you want to make any comments ?
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i will be reading this document on culture , language , elders &amp; youth .
mr. donald havioyak is the minister for this department .
we met on this department on april 30th , 1999 and he talked about the business plan .
there were a number of questions that were asked at that time for this new department .
this is a very important department .
members do have a concern and they spent a number of days on this department to make sure there is enough funding for this .
the department of culture , language , elders &amp; youth has less than 6 million dollars .
this department plays a key role in the preservation and revitalization of inuktitut and inuinnaqtun language in nunavut as well as providing translation services for the entire government .
the minister advised us that french and inuit language services agreements are being ...
members welcome this direction however , it is unclear how much of the departments funding is allocated to these tasks , particularly translation and interpretation services .
it seems to the members that the departments are scrambling for translation services and there is no clear direction as to who is co-ordinating these services and also how they will be used .
members have no sense as to whether the budget allocated for these services is sufficient , but fear it is not .
the committee was advised that there are four official languages in nunavut , inuktitut , inuinnaqtun , english and french .
members asked if the department is planning to bring forward amendments to the official languages act in this regard .
there are currently eight official languages in the gnwt act , which nunavut has inherited and we are advised that the staff is looking at this .
no mention was made of the official languages commissioner in this regard .
members had a good discussion with the minister regarding dialects and everyone agrees that we want to preserve the 26 dialects across nunavut .
members also asked about language training .
it was noted that human resources and culture , language , elders &amp; youth staff would develop a training course in inuktitut and french .
as a general observation the standing committee is concerned that this work seems to be at such an early stage of development .
it seems unclear from our discussions whether cabinet or the department of culture , language , elders &amp; youth have to take leadership on these issues .
recommendation ;
that the department of culture , language , elders &amp; youth develop a clear plan of action to implement this policy .
that the government of nunavut develop a comprehensive language training program for inuktitut .
nunavut arts council .
members were advised that the department of culture , language , elders &amp; youth is planning to establish a nunavut arts council and that appointments will be made in three weeks .
this body will have 136 thousand dollars for grants , 43 thousand for the baffin , 25 thousand for the keewatin , and 18 thousand dollars for the kitikmeot .
members look forward to hearing more about these plans as soon as the information is available .
nunavut territorial archives and heritage .
the department of culture , language , elders &amp; youth has been tasked to operate the nunavut territorial archives and oversee the archaeological activities in nunavut .
members were advised that there is no archival facility in nunavut .
members were advised that the department will be looking to develop a heritage facility in nunavut .
members expressed a desire to see artifacts and cultural heritage items such as photographs returned to their own communities as well .
members know that it may not be necessary to create dedicated heritage buildings in every community .
appropriate display cases could be established in existing buildings , such as schools , airports , hamlet offices , elders &apos; centres and so on .
it was further noted that the nunavut land claims agreement and the inuit heritage trust also play a role in repatriating cultural items to nunavut .
recommendation ;
inuit qaujimajituqangit ( iq ) .
as noted above , all departments stated a commitment to make inuit qaujimajituqangit the foundation of the new government of nunavut .
but , as members noted earlier , no department has articulated what this means .
elders and youth .
as noted above , all departments stated a commitment to involve elders more in their policy development and programs .
most important is to determine the partnerships that will provide support to the elders &apos; councils in each community so that they can participate fully in policy development and program delivery .
the minister of education spoke to our committee about the need to create and store tapes , videos , and written transcripts of interviews of elders regarding their traditional knowledge .
members are concerned that our elders won &apos;t always be with us and we need to do this right away .
members also know of situations where irreplaceable materials have been lost or destroyed by fire .
the committee was advised that the department was hoping to hire staff in the near future for senior youth advisor and elders advisor .
members look forward to hearing more about the departments plans for elders and youth once these people have joined the department .
recommendation ;
status of women .
no explanation was given during the meeting , and the committee looks forward to receiving this information .
as this will be an important organization to represent women from across nunavut , members look forward to hearing about these options as soon as they are ready for consideration .
recommendation :
that the department of culture , language , elders &amp; youth develop an options paper for a new status of women &apos;s council in nunavut for presentation at the standing committee .

&gt; &gt; prayer
speakers ruling
speaker ( interpretation ) :
before we start i would like to deal with a point of order made by ms. thompson yesterday .
i will make a ruling at this time , before we go to oral questions .
ms. thompson &apos;s point of order was in regards to comments made by the nattilik member of the assembly on may 27 , 1999 .
it is ruled out of order .
after we did the review of yesterday &apos;s comments in hansard i have to rule that there was no point of order .
the nattilik member of the assembly made comments about several different departments .
it did not break house rules .
it was an opinion .
the minister and the member had different opinions about the content of the members &apos; statement .
i would like to say at this point that we must watch what we are saying in this house .
thank you .

item 2 :
ministers &apos; statements
ministers &apos; statement 23 - 1 ( 2 ) new inuit rcmp recruits
hon. jack anawak :
thank you mr. speaker .
the new rcmp division for nunavut is known as &quot; v &quot; division .
chief superintendent chris bothe is the commanding officer for &quot; v &quot; division .
he has been in iqaluit since last august and has set up the new divisional headquarters .
he has also visited many communities for meetings with hamlet councils along with nunavut officials .
i am pleased to tell you that chief superintendent bothe is taking very seriously the issue of recruiting inuit members into the rcmp .
he recognizes the importance of having officers in our communities who know our language and our people .
in order to accomplish this goal , the rcmp are actively trying to recruit inuit members into the force .
so far this has been successful .
the first all inuit troop of eight recruits is now at the rcmp depot in regina for training .
they are scheduled to graduate in october , and then will be posted to nunavut detachments as full-fledged rcmp officers .
the inuit recruits currently training in regina are :
moses aupaluktuq from baker lake ,
josephe bain , pitsi koochiajuk , and ben williams from iqaluit ,
andrew nakashuk from pangnirtung ,
eric ootovak and kevin sadlunik from pond inlet , and
richard tatty from arviat
this is a new approach to training inuit recruits .
the fact they form a group of their own means that they will be able to support each other through the rigorous training program in regina .
as we know , it is often difficult for our young people to leave their home communities to go to cities in the south .
but by staying together through their training , these recruits will be more likely to succeed .
i welcome this new direction being taken by chief superintendent bothe and &quot; v &quot; division .
thank you .

canadian environment week and clean air day
hon. peter kilabuk :
mr. speaker this will be the first environment week to be celebrated since nunavut became a territory on april 1 , 1999 , and i plan to ensure that it continues every year hereafter .
mr. speaker , we cannot ever forget the importance of our people maintaining strong ties to our environment .
&quot; inuit qaujimajatuqangit &quot; .
mr. speaker , we are here today because our ancestors , through the generations cared for our land .
during environment week , i want to recognize the contribution of our ancestors in ensuring future generations could also live on our land and from our animals .
i will also look to our people to continue this very important responsibility .
i am asking you to make a contribution today to the care of our environment .
mr. speaker , this year , the first year of our new territory , i urge colleagues to celebrate the beauty of nunavut , and its clean air , and water .
i also urge colleagues to identify those environmental issues that urgently need our attention , and to urge all our citizens to take action .
some of the things that we can do could include :
reduce our energy consumption :
turn off our lights when they are not needed ;
reduce our water consumption :
use less water with your bath and showers ;
keep our communities clean :
organize a clean up as the snow melts ;
keep our land clean :
bring back everything you take out on the land and bring back the garbage of others you may find ;
keep our lakes and ocean clean :
bring back your garbage from boating trips .
mr. speaker , there is so much that we have to be proud of this year .
thank you mr. speaker .

gun control legislation and nti
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , nti has taken a firm position in the path of gun control in their position paper on bill c-68 an act respecting firearms and other weapons .
it is their position that the effect of the bill which is now the federal gun control legislation .
we have been speaking about whether or not this will prevent the inuit of nunavut , through the requirement of licence registration certificates and fees , from exercising their aboriginal and treaty harvesting rights .
mr , speaker they also specify that section 5.7.42 of the agreement protects an inuk &apos;s right to use any type , method , or technology to harvest .
mr , speaker i look forward to hearing from the government of nunavut their position in respect to the arguments put forward by nti .
i would also hope that the government of nunavut is consulting closely with nti in consideration on whether to intervene and what future positions they might take with respect to the gun control legislation .

documents not in inuktitut
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
today is friday .
yesterday two ministers , one for the department of education and one for public works both spoke about the importance of traditional ways .
this made my tail rise high but when the papers were handed out they were only in english .
they were no inuktitut versions available .
this certainly made my tail go down again when i saw that there were no inuktitut copies available .

mla &apos;s working in harmony
hon. jack anawak :
thank you .
i know that we are going to be working very hard on many government issues .
since we are going to be sitting here for the next four years , the members of the legislative assembly will have to support each other during the hard times .
also , we will have to realize , at all times , that we must support all people .
we are well aware that the nunavut government is a public government that represents all the people of nunavut .
we have to keep this in mind whether you are a minister or a regular member of the legislative assembly .
at times , as mla &apos;s , there will be debates between the ministers &apos; and members &apos; .
also , we have to realize and keep in mind that if we hurt one of our colleagues then we are also going to be hurting the people of nunavut .
we have to realize that we are representing the people out there .
if we mistreat one person then we are hurting the rest of the nunavut population .

hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , the government of nunavut inherited the government of the northwest territories &apos; wildlife act as of april 1 , 1999 .
this wildlife act was passed in 1978 and is outdated .
the department of sustainable development has begun a review of the issues that must be examined in the development of a new wildlife act .
the current wildlife act will be in effect until a new wildlife act replaces it .
as members know , mr. speaker , the government of nunavut is currently reviewing all of its legislative priorities .
once these priorities are finalized , we will have a better sense of the timing of the new wildlife act .

there was a question posed to the minister yesterday , when he was asked a question his response was that it was the responsibility of the board of governors .
so , he really couldn &apos;t answer that , so i was wondering what their relationship is in regards to the board of governors .
mr. speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. kattuk .
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :

question 120 - 1 ( 2 ) :
future of workers compensation board
mr. mclean :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question today is to the minister responsible for the worker &apos;s compensation board .
mr. speaker , i believe , currently , we have an agreement with the government of the northwest territories to share the worker &apos;s compensation board until at least the year 2003 .
i know this government is in its infancy and we &apos;re only 2 months into the mandate but we &apos;re here .
we have a nunavut government and we &apos;re up and running .
would the minister consider re-evaluating our agreement with the gnwt and maybe fast-tracking , setting up or splitting the current arrangement that we have with the gnwt .
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. mclean .
minister responsible for the worker &apos;s compensation board , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , the member is correct .
i believe there is a joint management agreement with the gnwt in respect to the management of the wcb that does run , i believe up to the year 2003 .
one of the options , of course , is whether or not to pursue establishing a separate wcb for nunavut .
it is one of the issues that we will be looking at and review it in consultation with all members and other interests in this area , mr. speaker .
thank you .
mr. speaker ( interpretation ) :

i believe that was more of a statement than a question but , yes , it is an issue that , obviously , will have to be looked at quite seriously .
we have to recognize that the wcb is an independent board .
it &apos;s funded by employers who provide , through premiums , the operating funds for the wcb .

we have to determine what kind of construction we would be looking at and we can &apos;t say that at this time .

health issues have to be addressed first .
i know that there &apos;s a need to work on these issues , because the materials would have to come in the sealift and we need to make those orders as soon as possible .
i have had a discussion with the minister of health and i conveyed to him that we need to work on this right away .
we will continue to treat this as an urgent matter and once hurdles have been jumped , i think that we would have time to get the materials by sealift to kimmirut on time .

thank you mr. speaker .
yes i have conducted a review , i have also met with my staff and officials who travelled to pond inlet to review the situation .
i told my officials to meet with other departments for example , the department of public works and as well the blue prints and to deal with the engineers .
they stated that they couldn &apos;t agree in respect to the old school and the new school .
with the department of education , i want to be able to negotiate with the local education authority in pond inlet .
i was told that what i wanted would have to be planned for about 2 weeks .
now within that period i will be expecting after 2 weeks a different set of options with which we can deal with the problem we have with the school in pond inlet .

chairperson ( mr. puqiqnak ) :
( interpretation ) :
please be seated .
if you would like to take a break it &apos;s up to you .
i &apos;d like to ask the committee what their wish is at this point .
we &apos;ll take a short break and we have to resume at 1 o &apos;clock but again we will be eating up stairs and the food will be arriving around quarter to 12 .
we will be eating here .
we will start our meeting at 1 o &apos;clock at this point we could take a recess .
if you want to have a coffee break we will go no later than 15 minutes .
maybe its best if we take a recess until 1 o &apos;clock .
thank you .
&gt; &gt; committee recessed for lunch
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i hope you had a great lunch .
we are on committee of the whole and we do have a quorum .
yesterday , we started with the department of culture language and elders and youth and we will continue on with it this afternoon .
i would like to ask the minister if he could go to the witness table .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. minister donald havioyak you may bring in your officials .
i would like to welcome you .
i would like to welcome mr. donald havioyak and his officials .
i would like to acknowledge his officials and his deputy minister peter irniq and their financial controller mr. bain .
i apologize for not pronouncing it well .
mr. bain .
if you didn &apos;t smile to each other this morning i want you to greet each other with a smile .
&gt; &gt; laughter
but anyhow we &apos;ll start off .
thank you for coming in and now we &apos;re on general comments to his department .
we are now on general comments .
mr. alakannuark had read the committee report yesterday and the minister responsible for this department had made his opening comments so we are now on general comments .
deputy minister peter irniq .
mr. irniq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
our departments name in inuktitut is culture , language , elders and youth .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i will try and pronounce the department in inuktitut well .
the department of culture , language , elders and youth .
at this time we are on general comments .
are there any general comments ?
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
seems like you &apos;re focusing more on these two issues according to the way i read the opening comments .
but on our elders at this time .
how can we get more job opportunities to the elders .
how can we make the employment opportunities more available to the elders ?
i realize that once elders and youth got together i realized that this was very important .
i feel that i &apos;m looking at the amount of budget 6 million , i know it &apos;s inadequate for the whole of nunavut .
we have also utilized the elders within the school curriculum .
i feel that if we could include all these issues within nunavut government .
with the previous government of gnwt did not really focus on culture .
so i feel that the nunavut government should involve the culture rather than just focusing on artifacts and we should be focusing on cultural education .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. irniq .
did you want to make a comment to that effect .
mr. irniq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
your comments are very true and heart warming .
we will utilize the elders and we will be continuing to create opportunities for them to work at the school perhaps at the learning centres .
we will be trying to get the elders to help the school children on culture and stories .
we will have them teach the young people how to make natural clothing .
we want to recognize those elders that have worked so hard on our behalf .
and did i answer your question ?
maybe i answered your question .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
when you said that the elders have been very useful and at times we let them do volunteer work for us in the past .
we don &apos;t want to see that happen again .
we wish to see the elders being paid under salary and i think that they should be employed under salary and perhaps by working together it can happen .
however , looking at nunavut as a whole , their budget is quite small for nunavut government .
nunavut communities it &apos;s only 6 million dollars .
if this funding could be evenly distributed to all the communities i would be very happy .
i &apos;m very glad that you had responded to me well .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. minister havioyak . please use the chairman .
mr. havioyak . hon. donald havioyak :
i &apos;m sorry mr. chairman i forgot about you .
today , mr. irniq can add further to that , what our department is doing so you have an idea exactly what we are doing .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. irniq .
mr. irniq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
yes , your question is a very good question and it &apos;s very good to hear that kind of a question being posed .
our mandate was to help the department help the communities so that we could teach the culture and tradition in the schools .
from the beginning , from kindergarten to grade 12 .
we have been planning that .
well actually the education and our department have been planning to teach inuktitut curriculum from kindergarten to grade 12 .
just for example mr. chairman , we would like to utilize the elders within our department more and we keep on saying that the government staff .
we would like see inuit on government staff more and we keep talking about hiring inuit more and that &apos;s our goal too .
but we will require your support and assistance with the interested departments and we have to work with elders .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you deputy minister peter .
we &apos;re on general comments .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
i apologize for being the only person to speak to this issue but i have been working very hard on this issue .
the writing system whether it is in english or inuktitut , i have tried to find out more about the writing system by using the students . even we are using inuktitut culture .
but the students mainly write down their material in english when they are being taught inuktitut culture .
i realised that they were getting very excited about seeing new things in their culture and i felt that it touched me , that &apos;s when i realized its very important .
the inuktitut instructors in the schools , they have to make their own school curriculum and that &apos;s how they do it right now .
the teachers need more support in developing school curricula .
perhaps using that new document that was brought up could be utilized by your department and by the department of education .
they should work together and work on this .
i just wanted to point that out mr. chairman and thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. minister .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
do you have the records ?
the item that we &apos;re going to be using in schools for teaching young children .
i think we will be working on that shortly and we want to teach the young people how to read and write in their language .
so we will be preparing curriculum &apos;s for the schools .
whether we teach them how to hunt and trap maybe .
maybe work with hta &apos;s on teaching the young people on the land programs and that .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
you have any other comments here .
mr. irniq will add further to those comments .
thank you mr. havioyak .
deputy minister irniq .
mr. irniq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
while we &apos;re working towards those goals and setting up curricula for the students and teach them the inuit traditions and culture we are going to be showing these children .
i know that inuuqatigiit was talked about in this house which is a curriculum that was set by the divisional board and it &apos;s already been implemented .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman for those responses .
one thing that we also have to think about because through experience i have seen how inuit and english languages are taught in school .
if you &apos;re using two languages in one house it deteriorates the language be it either inuktitut or english .
so i would very strongly suggest that everything be taught in inuktitut as a language of instruction in the schools or you &apos;re going to be teaching students .
if you &apos;re going to be teaching english only instruction or inuktitut only instruction there has to be a place for both languages .
i &apos;m sure that its not going to be implemented right away but saying that if you teach using two languages of instruction it slows down the learning process of the students .
that &apos;s how i see it .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
we have department of culture , language , elders and youth here and mr. iqaqrialu &apos;s comments i think are more appropriate if they were directed at the minister of education .
none-the-less , if you want to make further comments .
minister donald havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i would like to ask the question regarding elders .
while we keep hearing that the department of education and social services want to be more people friendly .
my question to this department is how close are you going to be to the elders ?
if there &apos;s something in between your department and inuit cultural institute .
my question mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kattuk .
mr. minister havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
i apologize mr. chairperson .
i did not quite understand the actual question .
maybe you should say it again please .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
did you want to clarify your question .
i believe that you used two languages .
you were speaking in inuktitut could you clarify your points please mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
that &apos;s why i keep asking for my own interpreter .
my question is how close are you to the inuit cultural institute ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kattuk .
like you said you needed your own interpreter .
the deputy minister will be making a response to mr. kattuk , mr. irniq .
mr. irniq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman and the members thank you .
in response to your question i believe i got your question .
you were talking about how close the working relationship is going to be between our departments and the elders .
within our department in the nunavut government we want to work very closely together with all the elders in the nunavut area .
we would also like to use the organizations that are set up specifically for the elders to work closely with them .
our department affects all communities in the nunavut area when it comes to the issue of elders .
that &apos;s for all the the elders in our communities .
thank you mr. deputy minister .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
i &apos;ll try again .
some of the communities have very well established elder &apos;s societies and there are some who don &apos;t .
is there a guideline that the elder &apos;s society will need to use in order set up a society if there is not one established in their community ?
chairperson :
mr. irniq .
mr. irniq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i believe i got your question .
we were asked to help our elders .
at the time we were with the nunavut implementation commission we were told to set up a system with the elders and the youth in the nic days .
there is no money available but in cambridge bay when the elders and youth had a meeting , there was a motion that dealt with setting up a council .
that was in cambridge bay .
that is the direction we would use after consideration and review by the nunavut government .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
this is not a question but more of a comment .
a lot of our elders have passed away and when they pass they take the oral tradition and culture with them .
possibly your department should gather the inuit qaujimajatuqangit as soon as possible by talking to the elders and gathering that information as soon as possible .
the elders have all this valuable knowledge that they take with them when they pass away .
their knowledge of the environment , the animals and each individual has their own knowledge and i believe that we have to gather that information as soon as possible .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kattuk .
that didn &apos;t sound like a question but either the minister or the deputy minister may respond if you wish .
mr. havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
yes we are quite aware of this .
because our history is verbal only , when our elders pass away we lose this knowledge .
right now we have staff in igloolik who are starting to use the traditional knowledge of inuit and the staff will be visiting elders in the community of igloolik .
we all know that the youth are losing their culture and we are going to revive this .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you . mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i have another question regarding the rankin inlet inuit cultural institute .
what is happening with that now ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kattuk .
deputy minister irniq .
mr. irniq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i believe that you are talking about the inuit cultural institute ?
yes .
the nunavut government has not signed any of these agreements , so at this point i cannot respond to your question .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
today it has been raining and i hear thunder out there .
there &apos;s a question and before that i would like mr. iqaqrialu to come to the chair .
chairperson ( mr. iqaqrialu ) ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
while i am sitting here i would like to see no smiles .
we are into general questions for culture , language , elders &amp; youth .
mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
my question is for clarification on the issue of elders .
the elders in the communities , in the nattilik region , the keewatin and in the baffin , there are different inuit tribes .
in respect to the elders how are you going to address this ?
that is my question mr. chairman .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
either the minister or the deputy may respond .
mr. irniq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i will try to answer you although it will be a short response .
in respect of the elders in nunavut .
we have always stated that without our elders we would not be here today .
the elders are our foundation as inuit .
therefore we are trying to develop a policy that is based on elders &apos; wishes , we want to hand them more responsibility based on our understanding of how the government was structured .
the elders in nunavut , we want to ensure that they are part of our resources .
we keep citing the example of the conference in cambridge bay , i believe in 1988 , which was a good first step for both the elders and the youth .
as we are going towards our future wherever that may be , we have to co-operate in our land and we have to utilize the elders knowledge in any way possible .
so their traditional knowledge about culture , language and our identity are the reason we need to do that .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you peter .
mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
please state my name properly it is not alakannuark , it is alakannuark .
this is more of a comment .
if this knowledge was recorded for posterity , the inuit people and the future generations can learn that .
that is the way it is and i feel strongly that it is important that it is being worked on .
sometime when we hear this , it touches me because when i was a young person , i felt the elders &apos; wisdom and that affects me all the time .
for example , a younger person would operate in written words but the elder would not know this as well because they operated in an oral tradition .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
i think i stated it properly this time .
mr. havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i understand his comments .
the nunavut social development council , the inuit heritage trust , we have to use all of the available organizations to see how we are going to operate as a government .
if we work together we can achieve these goals .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
sorry that was my fault .
thank you for providing the proper response mr. havioyak .
mr. puqiqnak .
i am sorry if i mispronounced your name as well , that does not hurt to have your name mispronounced .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i am not sure where to start from , but perhaps maybe i can give some background .
i am not sure how , but our ancestors , are our history and our heritage and we have stemmed from them .
we have touched part of that traditional lifestyle .
for example , people of my age , i am around 50 &apos;s , we caught part of that traditional lifestyle .
in this day and age i am happy to say that if it had not been for our heritage we would not be here .
they lived off the land and we smelled like the land , because we were inuumarik .
for example the animals had different tastes and smells , and we did as well , the hunters would have lice and so would the children .
i am sure we can pass down our knowledge but how can we make them understand , because they never lived that lifestyle .
they know where their historical roots are but they never experienced the lifestyle as we did .
it is too far in the past already and they never caught any part of it .
although that is the situation today i am sure that there are bridges we can build to bridge the gap .
if we get more funding , and if we could be assisted in other means , what process could we use to make them understand .
just to cite an example , i am not really looking at funding but this is one of my highest priorities , dealing with elders and youth .
as inuit in the different communities we have our distinct dialects as when the member from clyde river was stating he would like to have his own interpreter .
i am not sure whether you have thought about these issues .
when i look at 8-7 mr. chairman , we are talking about grants and contributions .
if the nunavut government could add more to the amount , i am not sure whether you have thought of that either , to put more funding into the grants .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
which of you would like to respond ?
mr. irniq .
mr. irniq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
in response to the 86 thousand dollars which are the grants for cultural enhancements , i understood exactly what the member for nattilik was referring to .
the promotion and protection for cultural enhancement , oral traditions , and cultural organizations .
in respect to cultural enhancements , there are different ways of writing .
for example in our main estimates , there are differences , some of them are crossovers from the gnwt and they were transferred and that is why they are there .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irniq .
mr. puqiqnak you are welcome to comment further .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i believe that last week i made comments to the house in respect to the museum .
i know at this time we want to see these types of things , but again the lack of financial resources has been an obstacle .
across the atlantic , there are some artifacts in foreign countries .
how can we get a museum to repatriate our cultural items .
from about 1922 they were taking pictures of my mother &apos;s adopted son , who was my grandfather and finally in this year in 1998 i have seen it .
he went home to his grandchildren and you could tell that he felt at home , because he was going home to his grandchildren and this was filmed in 1926 .
just looking at films and pictures , it can really effect you , it stirs up strong feelings , i am wondering how we can repatriate these types of items .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
which of you want to answer .
mr. havioyak or your deputy .
mr. havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
we are starting to organize and prepare for this , but i will always keep you up to date on what is going on .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. havioyak .
mr. puqiqnak do you have any further comments .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i wasn &apos;t expecting to be called so fast .
in respect to the community elders &apos; committees , i believe they will be utilized by the department where there are existing committees .
will they be given responsibility or duties to ensure that knowledge is garnered by the department ?
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
either of you may respond , either mr. irniq or the minister .
mr. irniq .
mr. irniq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
some of the duties under our mandate in respect to the elders we are looking into that , it is under review .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irniq .
mr. nutarak do you want to add further questions .
thank you mr. nutarak .
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
perhaps for the younger generation i will be asking about the youth .
the youth constitute the largest percentage of our population in nunavut .
is there a better way of ensuring that life is easier . are you looking into those types of options ?
that is my question about the youth .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
thank you mr. akesuk . mr. irniq .
mr. irniq :
mr. chairman , yes , we are conducting a review as to how we are dealing with the future government .
i keep referring back to the conference that we had in cambridge .
that seems like the first step for both the youth as well as the kinds of directives that we are looking at .
mr. chairman , we have been told the direction for which we are to undertake .
for example , we will concentrate a lot on assisting our youth in nunavut because they are our future .
this is one of the issues that the department is passionate about .
we are trying to deal with it by looking at the different options in respect to the youth .
there are different types of organizations .
for example , in baffin , keewatin , and in nunavut as well as in the west .
we have worked with those organizations to try and develop new initiatives .
it is a brand new department and we are still behind on some of our duties .
when this was given to us last year i thought it would be like catching your first walrus .
it was like trying to connect or build a walrus and it took a lot of thinking and planning .
we have had a lot of co-operation especially in trying to deal with the youth .
we are trying to work with the youth .
we are trying to be of assistance to the youth .
thank you mr. akesuk . thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman i have some questions .
my first one relates to the comments that were made in the ministers opening address .
it indicated that the department is developing a language policy .
i am also a member of a new standing committee which has the mandate to appoint positions by statutory authority that are made by the legislative assembly .
one of those positions is the official languages commissioner .
those will directly effect the role of the official languages commissioner , which is something that our standing committee is mandated to look at .
i am wondering if there is a willingness to work together in order to develop that .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
either one of you can respond to his question mr. havioyak
hon. donald havioyak :
i would like to work closely with everybody because it involves everybody .
we all have to team up together and work together and whoever is willing to help out is welcome . also like i said , we have to work together to regain our past .
peter has more to say .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. havioyak .
mr. irniq do you want to give a supplementary ?
mr. irniq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i would just like to supplement my ministers comments in regard to this issue .
language in the past , language services when we were growing up it did not seem to be very important but today it is very important and it effects all of nunavut .
i would also like to thank the member for asking a question in regards to the official language commissioner .
with our rating system we keep talking about how we can improve the use of language .
at this time we do have a language director , atima hadlari who is sitting in the gallery at this time .
we are now working on the language services to assist the government of nunavut on the inuktitut language as the working language .
we have all the translation services for both the public service people of nunavut , inuktitut and inuinnaqtun .
we are to work with the department of education from kindergarten to grade twelve in making the inuktitut language the instruction curriculum .
we will work with your standing committee .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo do you have any further comments ?
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. deputy minister for that response .
i will let you know that i will inform our staff from our committee of this and you will more than likely be hearing from them .
i look forward to working together to develop this policy .
mr. chairman the deputy minister touched on another issue that is important for providing all the documents in inuktitut and also in english .
is the department looking at starting up the interpreter corp , which was a division in the old department of education .
is the department looking at setting up similar type services in the department .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. havioyak or his deputy can respond .
mr. irniq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you for the question .
i think that it is going to be a bit different from the g.n.w.t. the language service is quite different then g.n.w.t.
in the past the g.n.w.t. had an interpreter corp and later on a language bureau was established .
once the language bureau was done away with we had taken the language bureau department back to the departments when it was with g.n.w.t.
i think that this department will be a little bit different .
when we come to the language bureau they will provide interpreting and translation services , but mainly we will be focusing on the three interpretative translators which will be the inuit language specialists .
it will be a bit different then being an interpreter .
they will be the people to protect and to preserve the inuktitut language .
also , while they are working on the language system they will also work with nti , regional communities such as qia and nunavut social development council .
while we are working with these other organizations we would also like to preserve our inuktitut language .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irniq .
mr. tootoo , do you have any further questions ?
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
again , going back to the ministers comments where he mentioned the youth division and that there is a key link between the government and youth .
mr. chairman i am wondering if the department has any specific plans in providing for any assistance for youth facilities and programs geared specifically towards youth .
they are getting into mischief and causing problems .
i was wondering if the department has taken any specific initiatives targeted towards this area .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
either the minister or the deputy can respond .
hon. donald havioyak :
your comments are very interesting .
in all the communities from kugluktuk to iqaluit to sanikiluaq we have problems with the youth .
we also realize that the youths create a lot of problems when they have nothing to do .
they are getting into a lot of mischief because they have no places to go .
we also know that this affects everyone in the communities .
i think that eventually once we have the capital plans and when they are in place .
we need assistance so we can create these programs for our youth .
i think that if we can all help each other we can eventually create some places for these kids to go .
i will be working on this .
we would like to make these programs available for the youth .
if my deputy minister can add a supplementary to it .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. irniq would you like to make a supplementary response ?
mr. irniq ( interpretation ) :
please , just a short supplementary response .
in nunavut we would like to work with the youth in respect to the fact that the youth do not have any place to go or anything to do .
we will be working with the communities and working with the youth .
we are urging the youth to work with us .
their needs are great so there are youth programs in each region and we would like to work with youth and youth programs in the future and today .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister and peter .
mr. you may ask your question again .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
mr. chairman , from the response i got , the minister would like to work with us to get some funding in order to offer these sort of programs for the youth .
the minister has stated that there is no funding available for these types of programs .
chairperson :
thank you mr. tootoo .
hon. donald havioyak :
you are correct .
we do not have any funding but we will still be working on these issues .
right now we are working on the process of hiring a senior advisor for youth .
we are also in the process of hiring a youth co-ordinator .
chairperson :
thank you mr. havioyak
mr. tootoo :
mr chairman , i suppose i received my response .
there is no funding .
as for supplementary comments i am just surprised mr. chairman that a territory with such a large youth population that there have been no dollars allocated for youth programs .
this really surprises me mr. chairman .
thank you mr , chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) : we are only 50 days old and of course we could not jump in and get things going right away .
you must keep in mind that we are a very young government . chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. o &apos;brien . mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. minister
hon. donald havioyak :
we do know where iq is going and we are going to work with the nunavut social development council to develop topics on iq .
we want to include iq within the government responsibilities . but , we have to work closely with our nunavut partners , especially the nunavut social development council .
perhaps mr. irniq may be able to add something to this .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. irniq .
mr. irniq ( interpretation ) :
that is a very excellent question regarding inuit qaujimajatuqangit and where we are going to go today and where we will be going .
the government of the n.w.t used to practice traditional knowledge in their schools such as in rankin inlet .
in regards to iq rankin inlet had midwifery .
i believe that they practice midwifery today . i am not sure if they are still practicing that today however , they practised midwifery using inuit traditional knowledge .
i do know quite a bit about caribou and what their migration patterns are .
with the elders and the renewable resources working together then we can begin to see a community that is practicing traditional knowledge .
our hunting rights and the licenses that we use presently should be using traditional inuit knowledge .
the governments call this the cultural inclusion programs .
inuit traditional knowledge is an old term , which we finally started using in igloolik this past summer at a conference .
the development council set up this conference with us and last year in march of 1998 we had a work shop .
we invited all the elders from all over the nunavut area they went to this conference in igloolik to talk about inuit traditional knowledge .
while we were there in igloolik we discussed various cultural issues in regards to inuit lifestyles , shamanism and traditional loss , for example , traditional adoption , which we still utilize today .
we also covered survival skills , land skills hunting , the environment , health , education and languages .
we covered all these topics at our meetings when we were having our meeting .
in august , the documents were translated from the inuit traditional knowledge .
in regards to inuit traditional knowledge , that &apos;s what we did when we were preparing for the nunavut government .
to date iq , inuit traditions have been discussed and we have also talked about how we can use the elder &apos;s more and languages .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irniq .
mr. o &apos;brien do you have any further comments .
mr. o &apos;brien :
that &apos;s fine mr. chairman , thank you mr. minister and the deputy for those comments
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
i have no more names on my list .
mr. iqaqrialu
mr. iqaqrialu :
( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i think it &apos;s been 3 years now that i have been a member of the nunavut wildlife board .
the inuit are very closely linked to the environment and to the different seasons and it &apos;s results in the winter and in the spring .
our world revolves around the changing seasons and i would seriously like your department to consider using inuit traditional knowledge when it comes to environmental studies and so on .
so we got a true picture of the north , it &apos;s not a question it &apos;s just a comment that i wanted to make and i hope that i got my point across .
thank you
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu , it &apos;s very true .
there &apos;s a lot of word that we use for the environment either the minister or the deputy minister can make a response to mr. iqaqrialu &apos;s comment . mr. irniq .
mr. irniq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
we discussed the various issues in regards to inuit traditional knowledge with the nunavut social development council .
we covered various topics like land survival , weather and we include the environment and everything else in these discussion .
thank you mr. chairman
chairperson :
thank you mr. deputy minister .
mr. iqaqrialu do you have any further comments .
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. chairman
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. havioyak or deputy minister irniq
mr. irniq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
will we work together with nscc in setting up the inuit qau-ji-ma-ja-tu-qa-ngit policies .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irniq .
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
it would be nice to know when to expect to get some kind of information back so that we can provide it our constituencies .
thank you mr. chairman
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister or deputy minister havioyak
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i apologize mr. chairman we &apos;re not trying to keep any information confidential .
like i was saying i could use an example of the elders who are now in the schools teaching inuit traditional knowledge .
that &apos;s now in existence we hear from the governments that we have to do more in regards to inuit traditional knowledge and we will keep working on it in the future .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. deputy minister .
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
the minister could commit to doing that just so that we have the information that answers the questions that are posed to us but that &apos;s all there is .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
deputy minister or minister of culture , language , elders &amp; youth . i think that &apos;s more of a comment than the question .
but if you want to make a response , i believe that was just a comment that was made .
mr. havioyak
hon. donald havioyak :
( interpretation ) :
thank you chairperson .
thank you
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. havioyak .
i have no more names on the list , i would like to thank the people who ask the questions .
my question at this time is if you would like to go line by line .
agreed .
we will go to 8-4 directorate .
mr. tootoo do you have a question
mr. tootoo :
thank you chairperson .
chairperson under this directorate falls a section that used to be in another department which is the status of women council , i believe , in that area over in executive .
i believe there &apos;s just an over all general position for equality advisor .
i &apos;m just wondering if that is going to be coming back into this division within the new department .
for my understanding the equality advisor , is just general across the board for everybody , i &apos;m just wondering if that &apos;s something that &apos;s going to be put back in after .
thank you chairperson
chairperson :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. havioyak or deputy minister
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you chairperson .
in our department following our department and in regards to the equality advisory position , it is in our department .
chairperson :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. tootoo , mr. akesuk
mr. akesuk :
i &apos;m sorry where are we now what page number ?
chairperson :
we &apos;re on page 8-4 directorate
mr. akesuk :
thank you chairperson .
what &apos;s the difference between the two ?
why are there two programs set ?
thank you chairperson
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. akesuk .
mr. irniq
mr. irniq ( interpretation ) :
thank you chairperson .
the difference between the two is the status woman is in the nunavut government and nunavut women &apos;s association is established in rankin inlet .
they had a meeting recently in rankin inlet and this was established .
the status of women is within part of the nunavut government .
thank you
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you deputy minister .
mr. akesuk
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you chairperson .
they don &apos;t have the same mandate , within these two organizations ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. akesuk .
mr. havioyak
hon. donald havioyak :
( interpretation ) :
thank you chairperson .
we are working on how they &apos;re going to operate within our department .
maybe it &apos;s going to work in different areas .
but we are , like we said preparing how they &apos;re going to function and operate within our department .
sometimes they are working on the same issues .
they &apos;re on a preparation stage so once we have everything else we will let you know , peter will be add further to that .
the women of nunavut and men of nunavut have to work more closely together but right now we &apos;re working on the options paper to date .
thank you chairperson
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. havioyak .
at this time we &apos;ll go ahead on page 8-4 , mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you chairperson .
i &apos;d like a commitment from the minister .
if he could go back through cabinet and reallocate some of the dollars that he has under contributions towards the youth programming in nunavut .
thank you chairperson
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. minister please recognize the chairperson you can only make comments after i have recognized you so we can hear responses .

chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i &apos;d like a commitment from the minister and hopefully his cabinet colleagues that they would ensure that there is some money in this budget dedicated towards our youth .
thank you mr. chairperson
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
maybe mark bain has comments
mr. bain :
thank you
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. bain .
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you chairperson .
mr. chairperson mr. bain indicated the a total of grants and contributions to 1.8 million looking at page 8-7 almost 2.4 million just wondering why there a discrepancy there and why ?
thank you chairperson
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. bain
mr. bain :
thank you chairperson .
yes the 1.8 million in grants and contributions is specifically is for culture , language , elders and youths and will service the needs of members asking about the use .
the remainder of that total amount 2.4 million are the status of women &apos;s grants money .
if you take a look at the 2 had been coming together 2.4 million which is the total grant and contributions for the department .
qujannamiik
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. bain .
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you chairperson .
is that what he is saying .
thank you chairperson
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. havioyak if you would respond please .
mr. bain :
thank you chairperson .
i &apos;m sure that those grants that we come forward with will recognize the youth and youth issues as the member is asking .

nakurmiik
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. bain .
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you chairperson .
mr. chairperson , then i anticipate that prior to any changes being approved they will be brought forward in the house for approval by all the members .
thank you chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. havioyak
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you chairperson .
we will be the ones that are at this table and we will make some changes and when we do make some changes i will let the members know .
we will inform the house where these grants and contributions will go .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. havioyak .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you chairperson .
mr. chairperson i &apos;m new at this so maybe i can be clarified .
this is my understanding , once we approve the budget that &apos;s presented here , that &apos;s how they go forward for the rest of the year .
the only way that they can be changed is through decisions approved through cabinet and then approved by all the members in the house .
i am just wondering if i can get some clarification on that , mr. chairperson .
thank you .
since it is in respect to the nunavut government , i would like to ask the minister of finance to answer that if you don &apos;t mind .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i am sorry i wasn &apos;t ... could i ask the finance minister to answer that question , mr. , is it ng or ning ?
thank you .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman , just to clarify on the issue of grants and contributions that come before the house under different departments .
so you are approving a broader classification of a grant program , which allows the department to expend funds under that category .
so it is not tied to specific projects yet , a lot of these programs , because those applications run during the course of the year .
it is not right now that you would know all of the specific details on those .
if you use another example , under sustainable development business grant contribution program .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
no other programs , no other contributions , would be allowed in there ?
is that what the minister is stating ?
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , then according to this list , for youth there is only 30 thousand dollars for youth projects .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
mr. chairman , i guess , you know the budget that we are dealing with now is the current one proposed by the government .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
at this time i am eyeing two minister here based on this .
either the minister , mr. havioyak , or the finance minister should respond .
either one or the other .
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
if i may mr. chairman , i don &apos;t know if there was a formal motion proposed , but it is certainly not a proper motion right now .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
go ahead mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
if that is the case , then that is what has to be done to ensure that happens then i would like to make a motion .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
at this time i will ask my fellow members for a 10 minute break .
thank you .
&gt; &gt; committee recessed from 3 : 24 and resumed at 3 : 35 pm .

mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
you have made a good decision , minister havioyak or one of your officials .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i think the question could be answered by mr. bain .
chairperson :
mr. bain .
mr. bain :
thank you mr. chairman , i can assure you that with the restructuring of our grants and contributions that no member of nunavut &apos;s is limited or excluded from applying for grants and contributions .
to specifically answer the members &apos; question , our grants and contributions will be oriented to cultural materials , artists groups , and whatnot throughout nunavut and youth will certainly be encouraged to apply .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
minister havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
does that answer your question ?
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister havioyak .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
yes mr. minister .
that would be if the dollars could be reallocated specifically for youth programming that is what i am looking for .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
yes , the answer is yes .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. mclean . thank you .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i would like to know if we have different kinds of women , that &apos;s why we have three different women &apos;s groups ?
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. deputy minister .
mr. irniq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
they seem to be different but they are all the same .
some of the issues we brought up in status of women will be in the nunavut government , but that is for a nunavut government department .
the nunavut women &apos;s association with 175 thousand budget , as i had stated , this association was established in the rankin inlet meeting .
the other women &apos;s initiative is to give grants to various initiatives for women .
this 250 thousand dollars will be distributed by the nunavut government and allotted to the nunavut women &apos;s association .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
at this time we had agreed that we would adjourn at 4 o &apos;clock today and the clock is ticking .
would the members like to continue or what is the members wish at this point ?

speaker ( mr. barnabas ) ( interpretation ) :
good morning .
i would like to ask mr. alakannuark to begin the opening prayer .
&gt; &gt; prayer
speakers ruling
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
at this time i would like to make some comments regarding the questions on the gun control legislation posed last week .
( interpretation ends ) during last wednesday &apos;s oral question period , i ruled a question out of order on this matter .
having now had the opportunity to review the written record , and after consultation with legal counsel , i am prepared to issue a full ruling .
the issue in question here is the sub judice convention .
however , the application of this convention must be balanced ;
so as to ensure that the workings of the courts are not interfered with , while at the same time allowing members of the legislative assembly to exercise their right to freedom of speech .
in matters that directly affect specific individuals in criminal cases , the convention is strictly applied .
in other types of cases , more leeway exists for members to inquire into matters of public interest .
thank you .
back to our agenda .

item 2 :
ministers &apos; statements
ministers &apos; statement 26 - 1 ( 2 ) :
corrections planning
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) : thank you mr. speaker .
as members are aware , nunavut faces some serious challenges with respect to corrections .
there are more than twice as many inmates as there are beds in the baffin correctional centre here in iqaluit .
we would like to have more of our inmates here in nunavut , but the baffin correctional centre has no more room .
it is already very overcrowded .
to help address this problem , we have begun some serious planning .
the nunavut department of justice has established a corrections planning committee to review corrections program and facility requirements , and to make recommendations .
the committee has representation from communities , as well as from the nunavut social development council , the rcmp , and the federal and the nunavut corrections systems .
the representatives from our communities are :
becky kudloo from baker lake ,
natsiq kango from iqaluit ,
simeonie natsek from repulse bay ,
elik tologanaq from cambridge bay ,
mosha akavak from iqaluit representing the baffin correctional centre , and
elijah erkloo from pond inlet , representing the nunavut social development council .
the corrections planning committee is chaired by rebecca williams , assistant deputy minister of the department of justice .
i have asked the committee to consider new approaches to the way in which inmates are handled , both in institutions and in the communities .
committee members had productive meetings in iqaluit for three days last week .
they will meet again in mid-july and will have a draft report by the end of august .
the final report will contain specific recommendations for action .
the corrections planning committee will present their final report to me in early october .
i look forward to receiving the committee &apos;s final report and to sharing the report with my colleagues .
i look forward to working together so we can make improvements to nunavut &apos;s corrections system .
we received a letter from the baffin correctional centre and it was also in the nunatsiaq news .
it stated that there were a lot of improvements we can make in regards to the corrections system in nunavut .
mr. speaker , we will be working very hard and diligently on this issue .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
before we proceed to question period , i would like to remind everyone to please keep in mind that we have interpreters when you are going to be making a response or a question .

hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
i am responding to the question raised regarding government of nunavut employees eligibility for staff housing .
mr. speaker , i would like to inform members that staff housing is an integral part of the staffing recruiting process in nunavut , and provides many benefits in attracting and maintaining staff .

oral questions
question 153 - 1 ( 2 ) :
eligibility for staff housing
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question is for the minister responsible for human resources .
first of all , i would like to thank the minister for providing an answer to my question .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of finance , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
that &apos;s minister of human resources , mr. speaker .
in respect to that issue , the circumstances about whether an employee would actually be eligible for government of nunavut staff housing , it depends on the individuals &apos; circumstances .
as it stands now , our policy is that we provide staff housing where necessary to support the staffing process .
so it depends on the individuals &apos; circumstances . thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , the minister stated that they provide it in order to facilitate the hiring process .
does that mean then , mr. speaker , that if there is someone who may be living with other family members they are not eligible for staff housing ?
is that what the minister is saying ?
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of human resources , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i didn &apos;t say that , i said that it would depend on the individual circumstances of that employee . thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , in looking at the written response given to me by the minister , i don &apos;t believe it says in there anywhere about looking specifically on a case by case basis .
i would like to ask the minister if the policy is there for everyone , or is it only there for certain people .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of human resources , mr. ng .
mr. ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , our policy impacts all of our employees and as i indicated it depends on the individual need of each employee .
so it would depend on their personal circumstances of whether or not they would be eligible for staff housing .
unfortunately , we don &apos;t have enough staff housing units for every single employee within the government , so there are some criteria that determine where individuals would be eligible for staff housing .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
your last question mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i am wondering if the minister could provide us with cases where someone would not be eligible for staff housing .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of human resources , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i guess to clarify again , the staff housing isn &apos;t a right of employment or a condition of employment .
we try to provide it as much as possible , particularly in the circumstances where there are specific needs .
on the broader issue , the staff housing , we need it primarily to try to implement our decentralization plans .
as it stands now , once we get some clarity to that , it certainly has to be one of the key criteria as it stands now , for eligibility for staff housing .
thank you mr. speaker .

mr. iqaqrialu .
question 154 - 1 ( 2 ) :
wildlife in captivity
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) : thank you mr. speaker .
i would like to direct my question to the minister of sustainable development .
there have been cases where wild animals have been taken as pets or sent to zoos .
for inuit , it &apos;s not a very pretty sight to see those wild animals in cages .
what are we going to do about wildlife that are taken captives , as nunavut government .
what approach are we going to be taking ?
it is not very nice to see wild animals caged , because they suffer and it can be inhumane .
i would like to see some kind of approach as nunavut government and would like to know what kind of plans you have .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister of sustainable development , mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
possibly , first of all , since we are a new government , we have to work with the people of nunavut and work co-operatively .
i would like to work closely together with the other organizations before we come with a different approach .
we should also look at the ways the wildlife are studied by scientists and biologists and so on .
so , we have to work closely together with the various organizations out there , consult with the people of nunavut in regards to wildlife that are taken captive .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kilabuk .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :

oral question , mr. irqittuq .
question 155 - 1 ( 2 ) :
financial support for student exchange trip
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , this question is for the minister of education .
the students of igloolik have asked me in writing whether they can get support when they go down south .
they are asking for financial assistance such as per diems for meals .
this question is to the minister of education , my question is ;
can the students get financial support .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) : thank you mr. speaker .
we have reviewed this request .
we can give support to the students of arctic college by way of financial contributions .
however we don &apos;t have anything for the students up to grade 12 .
if they are going to be going on trips outside of nunavut , unfortunately we don &apos;t have any money set aside for financial support up to grade 12 .
however , with that in mind , this issue is being reviewed by my department to find out where we can make changes to our practices .
we don &apos;t have anything right now but these types of situations are under review .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
oral questions .
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
with that response in mind , i can tell the students of igloolik that there is no money available .
speaker :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
they are not going down south until this summer so in the meanwhile it could be very likely that we could accommodate their request before they go down south .
i would make that response to the mla for igloolik .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
oral questions , mr. mclean .
question 156 - 1 ( 2 ) :
correctional facilities plan recommendations
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question this morning is to the minister of justice .
i was pleased to hear about the correction facility planning that is going on right now by the committee .
i am pleased to see that the committee will meet again in mid-july to have a draft report by the end of august .
i am wondering if the minister would commit to giving all the hamlet councils and the mla &apos;s some input into the final recommendations that are coming down in october .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. mclean .

mr. puqiqnak .
question 157 - 1 ( 2 ) :
certification for inuit experts
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question is directed to the minister of education .
the unilingual inuit in nunavut , there is supposed to be a certification program for inuit who have no formal certification but are experts in their own traditions .
i would like to know the status of this issue .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
to the minister of education . mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) : thank you mr. speaker .
we are looking at that .
there are inuinnaqtun and inuktitut unilingual people who graduated in a program who were able to get certification .
i think that there were four or five people .
they are experts in their own right and we are looking at how we can get them certified .
the way it is right now the students are given credit for taking programs , for example grade 10 , 11 and 12 and they have to earn so many credits in specific subjects .
these may not be part of the recognized subjects but i have asked my staff in the department to look into this very area .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
oral questions , mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i would just like to clarify my question .
those people who are going to educational institutions outside the community , and i have taken part in that as an oil burner mechanic and heavy equipment operator trainee .
we still see some nunavummiut who are going to southern institutions to take part in these programs .
we will continue to see these programs being taught elsewhere outside of nunavut .
i think that many people have done this work , we have welders and mechanics that have had to go outside nunavut to learn those things .
i think that we have people in nunavut available to teach those courses .
i think that many people can be certified to teach those courses in nunavut .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
the arctic college is currently looking at that very subject and we are asking them to review their policies for programs that can be taught to unilingual inuit .
or somewhere in alberta .
the building codes are changed from time to time and qualifications for electricians with new technology have to be upgraded .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
mr. speaker , this is directed to the minister of education .
i know that this is being considered by the department and arctic college and i am happy that the department and the minister are looking at this area .
thank you .

oral questions .
mr. iqaqrialu .
question 158 - 1 ( 2 ) :
search and rescue
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question is directed to the minister of transportation .
in the north we see hunters lost out on the land who have to be rescued by airplanes .
i think aircraft are used mostly for searching and sometimes they miss the people even though they might fly right over them .
i think this is a very expensive exercise when it has to be conducted .
now that we have a new government , i wonder how the government is going to improving methods for search and rescue .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister responsible for search and rescue , mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
search and rescue is very difficult at the best of times in nunavut .
i know that this touches a lot of people in nunavut when someone is lost out on the land .
we are starting to review this area and what our policy is going to be .
we will keep the members and the communities informed on how we are going to be dealing with this area .
but we will be utilizing people who are knowledgeable of local conditions .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
oral questions .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i think that we have conducted search and rescue at any given time of the year .
sometimes an aircraft will be in the area but will not spot the people that they are searching for .
sometimes the aircraft will be very close to the lost people and won &apos; &apos; spot them .
i wonder if this can be looked at as soon as possible .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. anawak if you would like to respond i will allow you .
mr. anawak minister responsible for search and rescue .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
yes , search and rescue is a serious subject at any time for the people in nunavut .
i think that we need to look at ways other than aircraft for search and rescue exercises .
so we would like to take a good look at all the ways that we have done search and rescue .
i think that the member has been involved in this area and i think that we need this input because all of the areas and communities in nunavut are all different terrain .
for example , in keewatin we don &apos;t have too many mountainous areas but in the baffin region the landscape is very different than that area and the kitikmeot .
we need to utilize the local people who know the land in their area .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .

mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :

mr. anawak , minister responsible for search and rescue .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
yes , we will be looking at this in the very near future because we are aware that we need to do search and rescue at any given time .

mr. o &apos;brien :

question 160 - 1 ( 2 ) :
housing policy for drug dealers and bootleggers
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question today is to the minister responsible for housing .
when i was making my questions to the minister responsible for the liquor board , in regards to extra legislation to be tougher on bootlegging in our communities .
i wonder if the ministers would commit to working together to draft up legislation regarding convicted drug peddlers and bootleggers living in public housing .
if they would draft up legislation that would have these convicted people evicted from public housing ?

he had indicated that the main focus for staff housing is to deal with decentralization .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister responsible for human resources , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i believe that i have indicated when the committee was reviewing the department of human resources budget there is actually two processes in iqaluit .
there is the regional housing allocations and there are the headquarters allocations , which we assumed from the office of the interim commissioner .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i would again like to ask the minister responsible for staff housing is the staff housing in iqaluit available for employees of the government of nunavut that live in iqaluit .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister responsible for human resources , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i will answer again that it is based on the individual needs of the employees that put forward their applications to the staff housing allocation committees .
thank you .

speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister responsible for human resources , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
unfortunately we don &apos;t have enough units for every single employee .
so we have to take into consideration some of the governments needs and requirements as well as the employees &apos; needs and requirements in how we allocate our staff housing units , mr. speaker .

question 163 - 1 ( 2 ) :
doctor for igloolik
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i would like to direct this question to the minister of health &amp; social services in respect to the issue of a doctor in igloolik .
i spoke to the doctor in question and that doctor does want to go to igloolik .
mr. speaker , i would like to ask the minister of health &amp; social services , if he has found staff housing for the individual .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
minister responsible for health , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , about three weeks ago when i was in igloolik meeting with the town , the mayor and the council members , they were very excited about the doctor going into igloolik .
i had spoken to the doctor previous to that after church one day , and she expressed to me her interest in going to igloolik .
after saying that mr. speaker , i understand from talking to the doctor that she had arranged housing on the ground in igloolik .
i had spoken to my cabinet colleagues expressing that if there was a problem getting housing that maybe we could look at one of the units that we had available in igloolik .

mr. picco , minister of health .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i could answer that in one way and i could say that is probably why we are looking at getting rid of the health boards , but i won &apos;t .
i am saying to you that i have spoken to the doctor again , i have spoken to her on saturday , indeed the member has spoken to the doctor .
she would like to go to igloolik , the housing doesn &apos;t seem to be a problem , indeed i will address this with the health board .

oral questions .
mr. iqaqrialu .
question 164 - 1 ( 2 ) :
power rate increases in clyde river
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
this is in relation to the minister of ntpc .
i wanted documentation and i did receive a letter , but unfortunately it wasn &apos;t translated .
i would like this clarified , in respect to electrical power bills and what is the percentage rate ?
for example , i have seen a little bit of it , and i am not sure whether it is true or not , where the percentage is .
i would want to understand exactly how much percentage would be included for the community and what are they going to give the community .
i really would like to understand the increase and the decrease of the costs .
i would like to find that out before i ask even more questions .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister responsible for the nwt power corporation , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , and i thank the member for his question .
indeed , as i explained in the house , the member had requested the information and i had to then again request the information from the power corporation head office in hay river .
in the expediency to get that letter to the member , as i explained , the power corporation from hay river never had an opportunity to translate it .
so this gives me an opportunity to explain , i guess , some of the circumstances surrounding the clyde river plant .
the existing power plant in clyde river is too small to meet the community &apos;s power needs which have grown at about 4 % per year since 1984 .
now , mr. speaker , the engine replacements with larger units is no longer possible for the plant in clyde river .
the nunavut director of operations , mr. axle have , based here in iqaluit , met with the community of clyde river and followed up on the meeting .
indeed , again in april of 1999 also discussed the project .
now it is a three year project worth , mr. speaker , to the community of clyde river , 3.9 million dollars .
a contract was awarded on may 15th , to kudlik construction ltd. of rankin inlet and kudlik recently completed work for the corporation in repulse bay and have some experience in this area .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. picco .
oral questions mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
in respect to the community &apos;s population gross revenues , it is going to effect the community and it is going to cause even more hardship .
i know that we really require that electrical outlet but it is still causes a concern .
the residents of my community have not heard and are not aware of the details .
perhaps , i think that the ntpc has already made those plans and they want to upgrade it .
we have to understand all of the details before we are planning it .
i think there has not been enough involvement of the local community in the planning .
the fact that the community residents are not aware of all the details , this may delay it if there is no funding allocated for the increase .
these are some of the options we have to look at .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister responsible for ntpc , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , the member makes a good point .
indeed , the corporation recognizes that it is a very high increase and will be reviewing options to look at how we can decrease that .
now mr. speaker , i should point out that the actual process for reviewing costs and setting rates belongs with the nunavut public utilities board .
the hamlet of clyde river will be notified when this review will take place , and indeed be invited to participate .
this is not expected , mr. speaker , to happen before early or mid-2000 , the year 2000 .
there will be no changes mr. speaker , to the rates in clyde river until after this review is completed and indeed , except for a possible adjustment next spring for rate re-balancing purposes .
... thank you for your vote of confidence mr. ng .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. picco .
oral question , mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i didn &apos;t know the meetings happened in clyde river , perhaps i missed them somehow .
i know that it has to be reviewed because in my community there are many unemployed people and the consultation process is not too good .
i know that once we increase the rate it is going to put hardship on many people in my community because they are unemployed .
i want you to come to my community very much so that we can discuss this matter .
if you are actually going to come to my community we will see you there and i hope we can explain this to the community .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu . minister responsible for the power corporation , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
if a person is not employed and living in social housing , their rate will not increased .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
final supplementary mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
my last question .
that is why i was a bit concerned and worried about the offices , commercial offices .
i know that private businesses and commercial offices will be impacted , so therefore we have to explain all these aspects to the community .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister responsible for the power corporation , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
now there is no direct assistance for this type of construction project , but as i explained , the nunavut public utilities board will have to review any rate increase .
i think the member makes a good point , that it is a very high increase and as i said , the corporation also recognizes that .
we are going to try and do what we can to help negate a huge one shot deal of a rate increase .
thank you mr. speaker .

opening comments - department of health &amp; social services main estimates
hon. ed picco :
qujannamiik mr. chairperson .
mr. chairperson , and honourable members of the legislative assembly , i &apos;m pleased to present to you that 1999 / 2000 main estimates for the department of health and social services .
later when we go to the witness table , i will be joined by mr. ken macrury who &apos;s the deputy minister of department and mrs. rosemary cooper who &apos;s the assistant deputy minister .
health and social services is important to all of us and to each of our families .
this department faces a range of issues that affect every person , everyday across the nunavut .
the 1999 / 2000 main estimates reflected departmental move towards the promotion and prevention oriented delivery system in nunavut .
the department , in partnership with communities , families and individuals is striving to create a system that is more reflective of nunavut realities and responsive to the people of nunavut .
the business plan we submitted outlines critical issues facing the department of health and social services , we face serious challenges mr. chairperson , in addressing these issues .
the change is required will not come easily and quickly , although we have taken early steps and making the required changes to the department .
our business plan contains a vision which calls to the department to delivery program and to services that or people oriented .
culturally sensitive provide for continue of care , provide a seamless service is sustainable over the long term , instils health responsibilities and individuals , families and communities and is prevention oriented .
mr. chairperson the health status indicators for nunavut are best described as being dramatic .
nunavut faces a great challenge in improving the health status indicators and i know with time we will make changes that will improve the status of health in nunavut .
i believe the creation of nunavut is an opportunity , an opportunity that must be used to initiate the health and social services reform .
our approach to health and social services reform uses a community development approach to achieve successful community development , we will initiate healthy public policy .
to achieve inuit employment targets mandated in nunavut land claim agreement , we will initiate a long term strategy for the training of inuit health and social services providers .
this will result in service delivery that reflects the culture , values and beliefs of the majority of our population .
individuals in this age group place a highest demands in health and social services , we must be in a position to meet these requirements .
we need new ways of doing things in nunavut , health and well being require approaches and ways to delivering care that go beyond illness hospital and professional services .
integrated and comprehensive prevention and promotion efforts are required .
in nunavut mr. chairperson we require a modern information technology system .
nunavut comprises 24 % of canada &apos;s land mass as you all know we are require to deliver services in 26 widely disbursed communities .
through technology we have an opportunity for creative responses service delivery , education of health professionals and learning from each other .
we must also provide the opportunity for quality care , cost effectiveness and very timely service delivered over vast distances .
the technologies of tele-health applications will realize the substantial financial savings over time .
on our operation and maintenance mr. chairperson the budget for the department is detailed on pages 10-3 which indicates on our total operation and maintenance budget is 117 million and 427 thousand dollars .
our original budget request was based on a detailed analysis of the requirement to provide enhance service to the residents of nunavut .
the reduction from the original request was based on the realities on the amount of funds available to all departments and to the government of nunavut as a whole .
the operation and maintenance budget is divided as for the pie graph in page 10-3 , you will note that the primary acute programs account for 50 % or 59.8 million of the budget .
the directorate of the department is currently composed of 15 positions out of a plan total staff compliment of 72 and 40 % current staff are inuit .
all of the expenses are associated with these position including such as a travel , office supplies , computers , telephones , are within 10.6 % or 2.6 million allocations .
we also included in the directorates from program delivery expenses which are delivered directly from headquarters .
community health programs at 8.2 % or 9.7 million and children &apos;s programs , mr. chairperson , at 3.5 % or 4.2 million round out the total operations and maintenance budget .
the department of health and social services is working with the department of finance in the construction of the health centre in arviat this year .
this project is being finance as a p3 project and it will not be reflected in our capital budget .
i will also welcome your comments on how we can work together to build a stronger health and social services in nunavut .
thank you mr. chairperson
&gt; &gt; applause
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , minister of health and social services .
i will now ask a representative of the standing committee to give us their report of their review of the budget .
jobie , who will read the report ?
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
peter kattuk will read the report .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
sorry , please repeat that .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
mr. kattuk will read .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
okay , mr. kattuk , go ahead .
report of the standing committee on culture , education and health on the 1999 / 2000 main estimates for the department of health and social services
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson , i will read a part of it in english and mr. o &apos;brien will conclude .
the honourable ed picco , minister of health and social services and departmental officials met with the standing committee on april 29 , 1999 .
the minister spoke very openly about the challenges facing his department and the opportunities that some of the new technology and training may provide in meeting the needs of communities .
the standing committee also appreciated the preparation by the minister and his department , which was evident at our meeting .
the standing committee had a very dynamic dialogue with the minister and looks forward to talking about these issues in the future .
business plan / operations / programs
the need for an inuit nurse training program
a most compelling issue for the members of the standing committee , is the need for inuit nurses in nunavut .
the minister outlined the departmental concerns regarding the high turnover of community nurses and the difficulties in recruiting nurses from the south .
this will be compounded now that a number of southern jurisdictions have recently announced nurse hiring increases .
it is a crisis in the communities .
members were advised that at this time , there is only one inuit nurse in nunavut , who recently began nursing in arviat .
at the health board level , only 3 % of the professional staff are filled by inuit .
the minister laid out a plan to fix part of this situation , which the members fully support .
a number of students have already completed a pre-nursing year with arctic college and could begin a nursing a program in september , if it were to be offered .
however , there is no budget at this time for this critically important program .
there is no point talking about article 23 and inuit employment in government positions in the health area unless proper training programs are being provided .
it took thirty years of ntep type programs to get 34 % inuit teachers and 4 out of 42 inuit principles . thirty years ago , dr.
percy declared the need for an inuit nursing program - think where nunavut would be now if it had been properly initiated .
the government has to start somewhere if we hope to see inuit health professionals in nunavut , and it should start now .
this department has a detailed plan , they are ready to go and they need our support .
a long term commitment is required , if we are to see it through .
members offered to come too , if this would help .
the minister noted that he had recently met with hon. allan rock , the federal minister of health and had raised these issues , including the need for funding for an inuit nursing program .
members commended the minister &apos;s efforts in this regard .
mr. kattuk :
i will give mr. o &apos;brien the recommendations to read .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. mr. kattuk for reading the report .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. chairperson , the recommendations are as follows ;
recommendation
that as a first priority , if additional resources can be found , the programs identified by the department of health and social services for inuit nurse training be implemented in this fiscal year .
cabinet decision to abolish the regional health boards
the standing committee appreciated very much the briefing that the department provided to us on the matter of the dissolution ...
chairperson ( interpretation ) : excuse me i might be wrong but i think we are supposed to vote on each recommendation as we move along ?
... no ? sorry , please continue .
mr. o &apos;brien : the standing committee appreciated very much the briefing that the department provided to us on the matter of the dissolution of the regional health boards and district education councils .
nevertheless , members still have questions and they felt that the people in the communities will have questions too .
there were small charts projecting savings , but no details on how those numbers were generated .
there will be more accountability to the elected minister , but no complaints procedure was presented .
members wondered if the department will create an ombudsman type of person to co-ordinate and streamline complaints to the minister .
members noted that smaller communities would need someone local to whom they can send information regarding their concerns .
who will take the initiative to create these councils if they don &apos;t currently exist ?
how do interagency committees fit in ?
what positions will now go to pangnirtung ?
the standing committee looks forward to receiving the draft legislation and reviewing more complete plans at that time .
recommendation
that the government of nunavut provide a detailed implementation plan to the standing committee , which includes information on :
and that any savings realized from abolishing regional health boards be retained by the department of health and social services .
tele-medicine
the minister presented some interesting information on tele-health facilities .
these are currently in the communities of iqaluit , pond inlet and cape dorset .
they allow patients to come into the facility in pond inlet and be &quot; seen &quot; via technology and satellites , by a doctor in iqaluit or even ottawa .
therefore , the government saved the travel and accommodation costs of sending these people to iqaluit , and the people were saved the trouble of leaving their community and family .
they may also be a vehicle to provide other services , such as psychiatric counselling or supervision of probation and parole .
the standing committee members were interested to see how this technology works and intend to follow-up to the invitation to visit the iqaluit hospital to see it in operation .
in light of the difficulties in getting doctors to move to smaller communities in nunavut , this may be an alternative .
members noted that there are sometimes difficulties with the technology , and it may be wise to wait until the satellite technology and linking is improved .
however , members look forward to receiving more information on the benefits and disadvantages of these facilities , and how these facilities might be paid for in the future
capital plan - financing capital for new health facilities - p3
standing committee members welcomed the department &apos;s plan to conduct an audit of what health facilities and equipment were currently in each community , along with an assessment of what shape they are in .
all departments should do this type of capital audit .
however , members noted that the department really had no capital plan for this fiscal year - only one capital project of $ 12,000 for the gjoa haven health centre .
over the past year , members have heard various discussions about planned health facilities in the regional centres and the possibilities of p3 financing .
members raised questions to the minister about p3 financing , but did not receive much information .
while innovative ways are needed to finance new health facilities , members are concerned about moving forward with p3 financing before knowing more about the pros and cons .
where will the operating dollars come for the o &amp; m of these facilities ?

mr. iqaqrialu
mr. iqaqrialu :
thank you mr. minister .
i think that i was supposed to ask you to introduce your officials , but you were ahead of me so i thank you .
are there any general questions the minister and his officials are now in the witness table .
you can now ask your questions or if you have general comments , regarding the departments .
main estimates , mr. mclean i don &apos;t want to make mistake on your name this time , go ahead mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
qujannamiik uqaqtii .
just in general comments that i want to make in health and social services .
we all know that in health care professionals and what i &apos;d like to call the care givers in our communities , are over worked , underpaid and under appreciated .
i &apos;m sure the current minister has a plan to help out with our care givers in our communities .
so , i &apos;m sure the minister will be dealing with that over the next few year &apos;s .
so i &apos;m sure the minister and i know his mandate was to use more iq in dealing with the family problems and situation .
capital projects we talk about , we hear about hospitals and regional centres and 3 of them are planned .
well to me i &apos;m hoping that if they build these facilities in the regions that they &apos;re going to repatriate the dollars .
is that the plan ?
so , i &apos;m sure the minister will deal with that .
chairperson ( interpretation ) : thank you .
minster of health &amp; social services . hon. ed picco :

mr. mclean has made some very good observation and the general commencing .

hon. ed picco :
tusaava ?
tusaava ?
mr. mclean has indeed brought some of good points , i had an opportunity to discuss with the members and indeed with mr. mclean and some of the issues that he had brought forward .
indeed as a jurisdiction in canada , we still have to lowest rates of cancer incidents in the population in canada as a whole .
i know for example that the concern has been brought forward , before and in the past the breast screen for cancer and in need mammography unit in nunavut .
and indeed here in nunavut , the increase in cervical cancer has indeed on the rise , so that &apos;s something we want to look at .
under chronic care side of things and indeed again mr. mclean is correct that something we have to incorporate , not only at the regional level but in the smaller communities .
the prescription drug situation worth 3 times national average i &apos;m not aware of those figures , that &apos;s something the department will have to look into .
with that mr. chairperson again i &apos;m available with my departmental staff of questions or comments on the department of health .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson :
thank you minister of health and social services .
mr. mclean any questions or comments .
mr. o &apos;brien
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairperson .
regarding the comments that the minister maybe have some information to the members .
and with the retention tying in - what the status is on housing accommodations for these individuals as relates to benefits in regional housing cost .
but we know that an issue that &apos;s been around for some time .
i wonder if the minister can speak to this in general .
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister of health and social services or any of your officials can respond to the question .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairperson .
as we &apos;ve discussed in this house before the shortage of medical professionals is not a unique to nunavut .
i want take this opportunity to thank them for their time and effort .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson :
thank you minister for health and social services .
do you want to add something here mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you chairperson .
i &apos;ll continue on with some other comments in reference to services that in the past for example in keewatin some services that attempt to privatize some services .
unfortunately or fortunately it didn &apos;t fly out that it &apos;s fair problems .
i guess i &apos;m concerned at this point whether the minister and his department giving any consideration to looking at this again given the past history .
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister of health and social services response .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i am completely and personally , philosophically against privatisation health care .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson :
thank you mr. picco .
mr. o &apos;brien i believe you have another comment .
mr. o &apos;brien :
mr. chairperson . i &apos;m please to hear the minister say that , i &apos;m sure all the people at least hear that i , live more than please to hear the comments .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
response mr. minister of health .
you want to respond ?
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman and thank you mr. picco .
that &apos;s good news for the people in keewatin and i &apos;m sure they &apos;ll sleep a lot easier knowing that services are in place for the next five years .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
i believe that this is just a comment .
other comments .
i believe we ran out of names .
mr. irqittuq proceed .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
the question to the minister respect to the health boards .
how much mandate or powers have been given to the boards from the ministers .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister of health .
if you wish to respond or any of your officials .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
so for example , when an operational issue comes up are you know do we need a social worker in x community or so on .
those types of operational issues are what the health boards are doing .
so sometimes it looks like the power does not rest with the minister .
i know the member is probably referring to the situation that we discussed this morning with the doctor for igloolik .
i hope that helps explain the question or the comment of the member .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister of health .
i believe you have a supplementary question .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman the department of health or the boards probably have procedures or powers in place because i &apos;ve heard earlier that this the move initially made was not approved by way of motion .
now , i &apos;d just like to ask are their own officials allowed to make actions without consulting their boards ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
any response from the minister or whatever officials .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
that &apos;s the board &apos;s decision .
the board has circumvented it &apos;s own policies .
so i wouldn &apos;t feel comfortable commenting on if the board circumvented their own policy have they voted on a policy .
indeed if the staff of the health board made any independent decisions arbitrarily without going to the board .
i &apos;m not aware of that and wouldn &apos;t be proper for me to comment on it .
what i can say is its similar to the education board .
if you have a question in staffing in school and everything then we have to look at the different education boards and say okay what &apos;s the status in the schools are .
but again the board operate and the boards govern they have their own policies and procedures in place and i &apos;m not aware of the board health board is voted on this particular one .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister of health .
mr. irqittuq , any additional questions ?
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
minister of health , do you wish to respond .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairperson .
mr. chairman , it &apos;s difficult for me to answer hypothetically .
you know if this has been done .
the power lies within the minister .
if the board has circumvented a piece of legislation an act , if they had done something that compromises the health of individuals then indeed the minister has to power to overturn that decision .
in this case have they made a decision at the board level .
i don &apos;t know , because i don &apos;t know again if the decision of the board is has made .
i haven &apos;t seen the motions i haven &apos;t seen copies of their minutes .
that &apos;s something i &apos;ve asked the department to we &apos;re looking into right now to find out how exactly how the decision was made , who made it , and so on .
so that &apos;s something that i take seriously as a minister and i am looking into it .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister of health .
i believe we are quite clear with the question made by mr. irqittuq but you don &apos;t really seem to respond fully .
maybe we &apos;ll be provided with a response at a later time but i believe his question was to do with what authority you may have in convening with the health boards .
mr. tootoo you have a question ?
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman . i almost stood up .
i &apos;m wondering mr. chairman if the minister and staff have any preliminary plans at this stage on how to readdress those issues ?
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. minister of health or officials .
do you have a response .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman as a department like most departments we &apos;ve only actually in place with the budget since april 1st , six weeks ago .
as a minister , i officially took over six weeks ago .
it &apos;s been i can say very strong and steep learning curve .
on the area of homelessness we do have one homeless shelter here in iqaluit that has had budget problems in the past several weeks and indeed some concern that the shelter would close .
as a department we are aware of that .
i believe my assistant deputy minister is working very closely with the homeless shelter committee to make sure that indeed the problem is alleviated and the homeless shelter has submitted a budget .
as a department we are trying to be proactive .
so hopefully we can rectify that in a week .
that &apos;s an answer to the member &apos;s question .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) : thank you mr. minister of health .
mr. tootoo , i believe you have a supplementary .
proceed .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. minister for going ahead and answering my next question .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of health .
i believe you want to respond .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , the negotiations are underway right now with the homeless shelter society and indeed as mr. tootoo knows my assistant deputy minister mrs. cooper has been working very closely with that group .
it &apos;s very difficult for me to give a commitment that the centre will receive all that funding that they &apos;ve requested .
i understand there is a shortfall of about twenty four thousand dollars right now from what they &apos;ve requested .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister of health and social services .
mr. tootoo your last question .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i &apos;m relieved to hear those comments from the minister as i &apos;m sure all the staff and members of the homeless shelter committee are glad to hear those comments .
my next question mr. chairman , is relating to the functional review of the programs through the hospital that &apos;s been mentioned by the minister of finance and also by the minister of health .
i &apos;m wondering mr. chairman , if the minister could provide us with update on this review and also what it actually is that &apos;s being reviewed .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
for your information , we &apos;re going to keep you to our ten minute limit .
response from the minister of health and social services .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
now we are reviewing it as a government to see if they &apos;re applicable to see if they should be added or taken away or whatever .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister of health and social services .
i will go back to you after we have given someone else an opportunity to make a few comments .
mr. tootoo . i &apos;ll give mr. kattuk and opportunity .
we &apos;ll try and keep up to our ten minute limit .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
mr. chairman , i have a question in regards to my constituency .
the medical patients from sanikiluaq have to get on government charters in order to go to churchill and to winnipeg for medical treatment .
i would like to know if your department is concerned about our community residents going to manitoba for medical services .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kattuk .
minister of health and social services .
if you would like to respond please .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i don &apos;t think we &apos;re concerned that you &apos;re going to winnipeg or manitoba because i mean the facilities there are very good .
second to none .
make sure that their health care needs are second to none .
they should not be treated any different because they &apos;re sanikiluaq and other residents of nunavut .
so we &apos;re looking as a department to find out what types of solutions we could put in place to alleviate some of these concerns that we &apos;ve heard from sanikiluaq as a department .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister of health and social services .
mr. kattuk go ahead .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
i don &apos;t know if i understood you clearly .
my question is the governments charter keewatin airlines and my question is are you concerned about the cost of chartering keewatin air services just from sanikiluaq to the keewatin or to manitoba .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kattuk .
minister of health and social services .
hon. ed picco ( interpretation ) :
... i &apos;m really the boss . mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
say it again .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman , i understood the question .
i guess the problem as to what we &apos;re trying to do is look at the cost .
i am concerned at the cost of the charters .
that &apos;s something we have to review .
thank you mr. chairman .

mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
find out from the people of sanikiluaq which location they would prefer because there has to be a close consultation of the people of sanikiluaq if we &apos;re going to be making any changes .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kattuk .
mr. minister .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i can commit to the member that before any changes will be put in place that indeed the department would consult with the people of sanikiluaq .
for example , if the patients of sanikiluaq are best served by going through manitoba , that &apos;s logistically , administratively , and i guess financially better for the nunavut government or not .
those types of issues we want to be able to review those before any decisions taken .
there would be consultation with sanikiluaq find out exactly what the needs of sanikiluaq and the residents are .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
in the region of kitikmeot and keewatin , and baffin we have a need for it takes a long time for the patients to get diagnosed early .
any chronic disease .
in gjoa haven there was one person who was sent out because of respiratory problems , they did an x-ray and he was diagnosed with advanced cancer and that &apos;s not the only case .
i strongly urge the health and social services to do a better job in taking care of the patients possibly by x-raying more of the patients and doing more examinations on their patients .
mr. chairman i would like to bring up one issue particularly about children in the gjoa haven .
little children are put to sleep when they &apos;re going to be getting their teeth extracted in yellowknife or hay river .
when we set up the nunavut government will still send dental patients outside of the nunavut area or are we going to be getting proper dentists services set up in the region .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
minister of health and social services .
if you would like to respond please .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
the member brings up a couple of very interesting concerns on cancer again .
i guess cancer is assiduous .
there are pre-screening that happens right now for cancer that we &apos;re aware of .
for example , on a regular basis women receive pap-smears and that &apos;s a way in indicating for cervical cancers which are being on the rise .
there is self-examination for breast cancers but to actually have the test in place , the test for different kinds of cancers on a regular basis .
no , i &apos;m not aware of any jurisdiction that does that .
we realize and i realize this is a major concern .
your chances of survival were very small . indeed those days are gone and most cancers today if detected early enough , there is a very good percentage of patients that have survived .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
deputy minister macrury .
mr. macrury :
on the issue of childhood , very young children can have major extractions if necessary .
our major initiative in the department will be to launch preventive programs to try and prevent these early teeth being destroyed by the consumption of sugary liquids , usually .
it is mostly caused by children going to bed with a bottle in their mouth which has milk or tang or some sweetened liquid in it .
then usually what happens is the second teeth come in and they have a lot of problems with them .
they come in crooked and one under the other and there is a lot of problems with those .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. puqiqnak supplementary question .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you for the response .
a lot of children had their teeth extracted just in the kitikmeot alone .
their teeth are taken out and then they are left , there is no after care treatment , no follow up care given to these children .
their teeth are extracted and then they are left .
do you do follow up care on children who have had to have a lot of their teeth extracted or is there any follow up treatment .
chairperson ( interpretation ) : thank you .
mr. minister .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , the member makes a good point .
but that won &apos;t be for a while yet .
on the follow up , indeed there is follow up done .
so there is follow up done , i understand by the department .
i guess , that &apos;s not fair .
a person would go forward to the tooth charmer and the tooth charmer would say a special little prayer and away went the toothache .
i just did an article on this so i am quite interested in teeth and teeth problems .
just a little story for you mr. chairman .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister of health and social services .
we &apos;ll take a break at this time , because i think that some of us have fallen asleep .
we will take a fifteen minute health break .
it takes us a little while to get back to our seats , even though we are anticipating the completion of the budgets .
&gt; &gt; committee recessed at 3.07 and resumed at 3.35 p.m.
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
please return to your seats .
we have pages here , can the pages go get the members from upstairs .
i think we can resume .
we &apos;ll just start off , because we are running late .
mr. puqiqnak if you still have comments you still have time to proceed .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i know that our minister is well aware of the fact of the population growth in the communities of nunavut .
especially when there is still some ice around and when you can &apos;t access the communities from the outpost camps .
not only in gjoa haven experiences that problem because campers can &apos;t get back to their communities .
when one get ill in the camps they have to be medivaced by helicopter at times .
sometimes there is no other means of getting a patient from the outpost camp other than by helicopter and they cannot use airplanes .
i have seen this myself .
in our area , it usually happens when there are families camping out for a few weeks .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
either one of you , the minister or his official can respond .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman the member brings up a very interesting point .
indeed , as a department one of the things that we are trying to do right now is look at a comprehensive medical travel study .
this would include medivacs and indeed looking at what the requirements are when people are in camps .
we might have to look at getting someone in by some other means .
that is part of the comprehensive medical travel study that we are doing and that we are looking at .
a lot of the departments mr. chairman aren &apos;t up to staff yet and i realize that in the department of health we are one of those departments .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister of health &amp; social services .
i just want to further point out that during breaks we should try and get back on time so that we can complete the budgets for the departments .
i think we should all try and come back after our break on time .
mr. puqiqnak , are you finished ?
thank you .
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i will ask a question in regards to the baffin region patients sent down to ottawa , especially from the baffin region .
mostly the patients stay at the hostel and they are concerned about elders .
so my question is what &apos;s the status with the ottawa patients .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. akesuk .
mr. minister .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman . mr. chairman the member makes a good point .
indeed , i have had that situation with a member of my family who went down without an escort and it was a bit of a problem .
based on operational requirements .
i will also be visiting the rotel in july to see the situation there with the rotel as the minister of health .
i think we are pretty confident in the way that is being applied .
when the health services first transferred from montreal to ottawa , we had more concerns there were some problems at that time with the development of the services provided by osgoode .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. akesuk , do you have any further questions .
thank you .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i said i had my hand up when we were talking about tooth extraction , but i didn &apos;t get to hear his last comment .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
what is your question .
i think that was just a comment . i still didn &apos;t understand what you said .
could you rephrase your question .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i would like to ask a question in regards to the boarding home in yellowknife .
my question is , how do you take care of the patients , that have to stay elsewhere ?
what are your plans , mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
mr. minister or your officials can respond .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i am going to ask a question in regards to the boarding homes that don &apos;t have co-ordinators or directors who understand inuktitut , especially the elders .
this is a problem in the boarding homes , especially when the elders have to go there and the directors or the staff in the boarding homes cannot read and write in inuktitut .
i would like to see some co-ordinators or directors of the boarding homes to be bilingual . thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
mr. minister .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , the member makes a very good point .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i urge you to ensure that the elders be escorted or have interpreters when they have to be treated outside of their home community .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
mr. minister .
i think that was more of a comment , or would you like to respond ?
thank you .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister for your appropriate answer .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
i am just wondering what type of wide spread studies is the minister conducting now or looking at conducting as they relate to epidemiology ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. minister , or your officials can respond to him .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , the member raises a very good area of concern of ours at the department of health for nunavut .
epidemiology and indeed the epidemiologist is a very rare field , it is very hard to hire epidemiologists .
we are fortunate that we will be having an epidemiologist working on staff .
indeed the person just finished a university degree right now , and indeed tomorrow our chief medical officer for nunavut will be in place and our assistant chief medical officer some time after that .
we want to be able to look at all the health characteristics of nunavut specifically .
in the past , just a short six weeks ago before april 1st , we were part of the northwest territories and there was an epidemiologist on staff with that department .
indeed , the government of the northwest territories had problems finding epidemiologists , to look at the field of epidemiology .
so that matter is being looked into and indeed epidemiology is a very complex area of medical science and we will have an epidemiologist in place very shortly .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
it takes a while for you to respond to some members .
we have to proceed with business here , your officials can respond if you don &apos;t know the answer .
mr. o &apos;brien do you have any further questions or comments .
proceed .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
just one other question and i think it is a question that concerns all the members here .
i am curious as to how the minister is going to incorporate the inuit qaujimajatuqangit factor with the reduction of trimethane in the home ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. minister of health &amp; social services .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
for example , with custom adoptions we are using inuit qaujimajatuqangit .
as i said earlier mr. chairman , with mental health we are looking at ways of using inuit qaujimajatuqangit .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. o &apos;brien do you have any further questions ?
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman and thank you mr. minister for that answer .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. minister .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , as the member probably knows and is aware , every month most members previously used to receive a copy of the epi-north newsletter which is put out by the gnwt .
i see that the member has a copy of the newsletter with him .
mr. macrury :
we have identified that there are studies required in several of the things that have been talked about here already today .
cancer , is one of the things . we have a different characteristics of cancer infections in nunavut from the nwt and perhaps from other jurisdictions in canada .
so we are going to be looking at that .
we have different characteristics in the pre-natal and post-natal disease pattern in children .
so we are going to be looking at some of those issues .
we are going to be looking at various other characteristics around stomach complaints that have to be looked at .
so there are a broad range of issues that are different than they are in other jurisdictions , and those are some of the things that we will be looking at .
right now we are in the process of identifying just what area we have to do those studies .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. macrury .
mr. o &apos;brien do you have another question .
mr. o &apos;brien :
yes , just one follow up point to this issue .
would you also be looking at the increase of tb in nunavut .
thank you .
mr. macrury :
yes mr. chairman , we have identified tb as a major concern .
as a department we have reserved some money that we can allocate to special needs of the boards and we will look at that later in the context of the budget .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. macrury .
please recognize the chairperson before speaking .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i have been sitting so long it seems like it is time to get up .
mr. chairman , earlier it had asked about the plans for the department in the future to deal with some of the problems that we are facing .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of health or your official .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
as the members know there are several different changes that we would like to do in the department of health .
one of them we have announced is the elimination of the health boards .
mr. dave ramsden is working on that process right now and how we will deliver health &amp; social services after march 2000 .
i don &apos;t know if mr. macrury would like to add anything to that .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. macrury would you like to make a supplementary response ?
mr. macrury :
at the same time dealing with the acute care cases , have to be addressed , but in reality trying to move more in that direction of prevention and promotion .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. macrury .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. minister .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
they are actually in lockstep with us on the delivery of those services .
so yes , the short answer mr. chairman is yes , the department of health for nunavut is looking at a holistic and complete approach for the delivery side of health and social services .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. tootoo , do you have a supplementary question .
mr. tootoo :
yes , thank you mr. chairman .
just a suggestion , i would urge that throughout the last few months i know in my constituency and also in the ministers &apos; , there are numerous health care providers residing here .
i would urge strongly that the department approach those people as well and not leave them out of this process .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. minister .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i think all members know and realize that as we started off this government on april 1 , the expectations of our staff are very high .
as we are trying to get up to capacity as a government there has been so much demand put on our staff , hours and hours of time worked .
indeed , we do have , i think it is safe to say , some problems with morale .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. picco .
mr. tootoo , i believe that you have another comment or question .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
so they are the ones that know how best to maybe , accommodate some of these changes that need to be faced .
that &apos;s more what i was referring to .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. minister .
hon. ed picco :
take a proactive stance on the way health &amp; social services is delivered .
not only at the regional level but at the local and community level , and indeed nunavut wide .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
at this moment i ran out of names on my list , if there are no more questions .
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i received a letter from my constituency just recently in respect to the health people in our community .
people have talked about the human resources and about the female / male staff .
could we ask if an individual is women or not , to me it effects me deeply .
i agree with women , i grew up with women .
i know they are very skilled , they are very independent .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
mr. minister , or your officials if you want to add anything to that .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
i understand the member and i agree that we need equality .
not just among the sexes , but among the races , the people of nunavut . i think that as a government that is what we are striving towards .
as a department that is what we are trying to strive towards .
i appreciate the members &apos; comments .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. minister .
mr. puqiqnak .
supplementary .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
in kitikmeot in the former government in respect to the boarding home .
i want to ask maybe more on this later , but i believe i have asked you this question , in respect to lena pederson and the contract on the boarding home .
with respect to lena pederson , back in the 70 &apos;s or 80 &apos;s the boarding home was opened .
back then the contract was awarded to an inuit firm and to date this contract is outside of nunavut .
this is an interest now being taken on by my constituents , in respect to article 24 and 23 in the land claims agreement .
in view of that and this being within nunavut , i believe that this contract should be taken by a firm within nunavut .
how have you been effected by this within your department .
that is my question .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
minister of health , do you wish to respond .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
after april 1 , and becoming the minister of health i was requested to review the award of that contract and indeed to look at specific arrangements under article 24 .
that information was provided to me and indeed we provided it to the people that asked .
we are also right now in the middle , i believe , of responding to a similar query from nti on the applicability of article 24 .
thank you mr. chairman , i hope that answer the question .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
any further comments mr. puqiqnak .
thank you .
at this time i don &apos;t have any more names on my list for comments or questions .
i think we can move on to the finances .
mr. akesuk , do you have a comment .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
i didn &apos;t finish with my question , just a supplementary .
maybe just ten more questions .
at the moment people aren &apos;t able to have easy access to the office .
what is being done or what plans are there for this area .
that is my question , thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. akesuk .
mr. minister of health , sometimes it will be confusing who will be asking you questions but do you have a response .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu , you are doing a very good job today .
thank you mr. chairman , i just caught the last piece of what mr. akesuk was asking because i was being advised on the epidemiology situation with mr. o &apos;brien in my ear .
i am wondering if mr. akesuk , could just succinctly repeat his question for expediency .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. akesuk , could you rephrase your question .
mr. akesuk :
i don &apos;t know if you have the epidemiology problem or not in your ear so , thank you mr. chairman .
( interpretation ) my question first is with respect to back in montreal the office was just below the boarding home .
in ottawa there is no easy access to the office .
the patients don &apos;t have easy access , so i was just wondering whether the health office would be relocated and be more accessible to the boarding home and the patients .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. akesuk .
mr. minister .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
go ahead .
mr. macrury :
thank you mr. chairman .
if i might remind the member from the baffin , in the montreal situation where we had baffin house , the actual baffin regional health board ran the boarding house .
it was staffed and operated by staff of the baffin board and the only thing that we were purchasing in montreal was the health care .
we purchased the health care from the mcgill program operating in several hospitals in montreal .
when we made a decision to transfer the services from montreal to ottawa , one of the fundamental differences was we wanted the ottawa providers to provide a comprehensive service .
so as soon as the patient gets off the plane in montreal they are then the responsibility of the service provider .
so they provide the boarding , they provide the translation services , they provide the transportation and they provide the health care .
i think that there is a fundamental difference there that the people on the baffin regional health board wanted to see .
so one of the differences was is that it is not supposed to replicate the montreal service . thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. macrury .
mr. akesuk , do you have a further question .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i think my question would be are we going to be asking what the general consensus is on this issue in nunavut .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. akesuk .
mr. minister , do you wish to add anything .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
the member brings up a good point and that is one of the reasons why we are actually going to ottawa , to look at the operation and the rotel .
i will be doing that in july , and indeed i think i mentioned this one , to look at the nunasi corporations &apos; building , larga homes .
that appeals to me , i think it is a good way of looking at things , but i haven &apos;t seen the facility or anything like that .
the contract we have right now is in place , it is with osney , and we have been accessing the rotel .
where it hasn &apos;t met all of our needs , i think it is fair to say , it has come a long way since last year when we first started using them .
there are some things that could be maybe made a little bit better and maybe a bit more conducive to unilingual people , elderly people and so on .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. akesuk , any more .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
my last question in respect to patients who have no escorts or who were not provided escorts .
when they go in the hospital although they are just unilingual you don &apos;t have any interpreters provided or interpreters are not provided right away , what are you going to do about it .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
but you want to add anything further mr. minister ?
hon. ed picco :
thank you .
no , you &apos;re correct mr. chairman .
that is what i &apos;m looking at and making more conducive for nunavut people needs .
we understand the difficulty and i should maybe just point out very quickly ;
so on and so forth .
same thing with us mr. chairman .
when we have unilingual people we have to send them to ottawa .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. akesuk .
any more ?
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman thank you .
i just have one question in respect to health centres in communities .
that is my question .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
mr. minister . any response .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i was speaking to the deputy minister concerning the review of capital projects .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
it has been a hospital for twenty years now .
do you have any kind of regulations on hospitals and health centres where they have to get renovated or you have to build a new one within a certain time frame ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
mr. minister .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman the member makes a couple of good points .
as we know in 1988 northwest territories took over health from the federal government .
up to that time the canadian government built and maintained all facilities in nunavut .
and they built some new facilities .
since that time , over the last ten years , it became the responsibility of the government of the northwest territories .
and as we know as a government we don &apos;t really have the money now within our capital budget to build new facilities .
and indeed in my capital budget today we only have two point one million dollars .
which is basically for minor renovations and code violations and so on .
where do we find the money to do those types of things .
the baffin hospital mr. chairman was built in 1962 , was built for a population when iqaluit was probably fifteen hundred to two thousand people .
today that population has tripled and they &apos;re serving a region of nunavut that has tripled .
the need is for a new hospital that &apos;s recognized again we don &apos;t have the money for it so we have to do a p3 process .
i can assure the member that one of my priorities as a minister is to make sure that we look at the facility in pond inlet .
because i am aware of that facility and indeed we need to do some work there .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
jobie nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
i would like to thank you also for answering part of the question i was going to ask , so there . thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
i think that we can be better co-ordinated if the health givers and the employees do their part .
i believe that we can start with 10-4 now . agreed ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
chairperson ( interpretation ) : first of all the directorate operations and maintenance .
total operations and maintenance ten million , four hundred ninety-four .
agreed ? agreed .
i &apos;m sorry if i didn &apos;t pronounce that properly but everybody agreed .
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk :
thank you .
my question is supplementary to a question that i asked earlier .
on salaries and wages .
my community doesn &apos;t have a social service worker and i &apos;m sure that py &apos;s salary and wages is in here somewhere .
my question is , is the py included in here for kimmirut ?
mr. minister .
mr. picco :
i remember the question .
i remember it very well indeed .
the part about the social worker situation was dealt with the health board and that &apos;s why i say this indeed .
when i &apos;m looking at the salary dollars here that &apos;s within the department of health and social services .
the directorate area .
the health boards is another page with maybe on 10-7 and so the member would like to hold that question on wages and benefits .
health board monies that we give them is where we would find that line .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .

mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman . if we look at the child , family and special services section .
what does it mean , there is 2.1 million here , what kind of services are we talking about under this particular heading .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. minister , picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman i would like to ask the assistant deputy minister maybe to elaborate a little more on the specifics of the children &apos;s &apos; programs and services .
on the members &apos; question on the 2.1 million i don &apos;t see that figure here , could the member clarify if he is on 10 - 8 .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
assistant deputy minister , ms. cooper .
ms. cooper ( interpretation ) :
if we look at number 12 and if we go back to number 11 , it gives you further details on monies that are geared towards children ;
wellness , and adoption .
that &apos;s what these monies are used for .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. cooper .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman . i have yet to see specialized services that are geared towards child and family special needs .
i am not quite sure what these services include .
when we say adoption , are their transportation expenses paid for by the department of health &amp; social services , if they are going to be adopting .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. minister , are you going to respond to that question .
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , ms. cooper the assistant deputy minister will try to clarify the members question .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
assistant deputy minister , ms. cooper .
ms. cooper ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
in regards to children , for example , if you have a concern regarding a child &apos;s need for a healthy lifestyle , we have identified here that services can be provided .
can we ask questions while we &apos;re sitting here ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
maybe i can ask the member if he &apos;s concerned about money that &apos;s allocated for the children .
that &apos;s under this is going to be utilized for children &apos;s services .
it &apos;s not to be allotted to the communities .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu :
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) : thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
you can either respond to it yourself . hon. ed picco :
mr. chairman , i believe under details grants and contribution 2-1 .
when we mention children that &apos;s only one small part of it .
when we are trying to explain what the money was used for .
for example , if i had an adopted child with mental problems or psychiatric problems i would use the services at the health board for counselling that would be covered under there for example .
of course the cost of bringing my adoptive child if they were from pangnirtung , or clyde river back and forth to iqaluit to see the psychologist that would be covered under there .
so it were be geared towards social services as an example .
i don &apos;t know if that helps but maybe explain why the amount is there but it &apos;s a multi-faceted component .
mr. chairman thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. iqaqrialu do you have any further comments or questions ?
mr. iqaqrialu :
i still don &apos;t understand .
like children &apos;s programs .
are we talking about family allowances ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
what kinds of children &apos;s programs are you talking about in there ?
hon. ed picco :
thank you .
maybe the program verbiage is the wrong verbiage to use in this case .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
the first one is 2 million 100 thousand for the one you just answered me with children &apos;s programs , i thought was that was in the upper one .
i think it should not be children &apos;s programs that way it &apos;ll be a lot clearer to understand .
i don &apos;t understand it .
chairperson :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. picco
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
again maybe it &apos;s the verb that it &apos;s been used , i &apos;ll try to explain it this way .
when we talk about 2.1 million under child , family and special need services , that &apos;s basically mental health for children across nunavut .
everyone in the three regions , that &apos;s what that &apos;s for .
when we talked about children &apos;s programs which is 3.2 , that david has just been talking about , that was for children in care .
again three regions divide it , i think the problem here is in the verb .
we said it &apos;s being used , this money goes directly to the health boards and they use it .
i mean i had to stay , personally i had a foster child who &apos;s under one of these programs , so i know a little bit about how it worked .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. picco .
mr. iqaqrialu
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
now i understand what it contains .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
i have only one name on the list now .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i &apos;ll be brief in my comments .
if there &apos;s any studies as to what can be done to prevent it .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. picco
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairperson .
mr. chairperson epidemiology is the study of skin and i know that i &apos;m not a skin expert , mr. chairperson .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. picco .
mr. o &apos;brien
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairperson .
that &apos;s hard to match , mr. picco .
on a more serious note , i &apos;m still curious is there any research being done on the some of the problems that some young children do have .
we &apos;ve noticed this in some of the communities for years .
we should be looking at some preventative measures about what causes this instead of just accepting it .
thank you mr. picco any rashes that i may have , or come upon , i &apos;ll leave it at that .
thank you
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairperson .
mr. chairman , i thank the member for his earlier question indeed , sometimes after this process we sometimes have to have a little levity and i appreciate that .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. picco .
mr. iqaqrialu
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
under 9 million 575 thousand the heading starts with the community health programs .
the translation literally states that the community in order to have healthy communities .
is that a fact , are we going to provide this service so that there could be healthier communities , is that what the fund is for ?
maybe perhaps you could explain what the community health program is .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. picco
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairperson .
community awareness programs on specific issues , the member &apos;s correct it is not lying here that 9.575 million is not for community wellness .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. picco .
mr. iqaqrialu
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
yes , this program 9 million the inuktitut version is different from the way you responded to me .
so it &apos;s quite similar to the program we had earlier , the community wellness program .
if this program is going to be allotted , is this fund going to be made available through applications or is it going to be just allotted to the communities or the boards .
thank you chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. minister
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairperson .
according to translation i think to 10 or 11 to community wellness so maybe that &apos;s what we should have been referring to .
under this one this 9.575 for example they &apos;d run the spousal assault homes for family violence programs .
that &apos;s what is covered on this when we say community health programs .
for example that &apos;s how we fund them and again it &apos;s nunavut wide that &apos;s not specific to one region , i don &apos;t know if that makes it more clear .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. picco .
mr. iqaqrialu
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i don &apos;t know what date it was during our session .
we discussed the women &apos;s shelter .
i think we have to have good general direction for this .
i hope this money will be used for shelters and things like that .
i &apos;ll just conclude with that mr. chairperson .
thank you
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
i think that was more of a comment than a question .
i would like to get back to the main estimates .
on page 10-10 detail of grants and contributions .
that &apos;s just an information item .
going to 10-11 detail of work performed on behalf of third parties .

hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i &apos;d like to thank the members for their support and consideration of the budget .
sometimes when we talk about the department of health , there &apos;s a lot of sickness , there &apos;s death and dying .
it can be very depressing , but i want to say to you is that a lot of exciting things are happening in health .
thank you mr. chairperson .
&gt; &gt; applause
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :

we have completed the department .
mr. picco &apos;s department is completed .

&gt; &gt; committee recessed at 5.01 and resumed at 5.12 pm .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
we are still trying to get education officials over here , we should be returning to our seats .
mr. akesuk
mr. akesuk :
thank you mr. chairperson .
what i would like to say right now is i would like to hear the opening comments by the minister of the department and also get the committee report read in .
then we can ask our questions and make general comments tomorrow mr. chairman .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. akesuk .
so let &apos;s clarify that because we have only 1 hour .
mr. akesuk , are you making a motion to go ahead ?
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
yes , i move that we deal with the opening remarks by the minister of education .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
is there a seconder for the motion .
he doesn &apos;t need a seconder .
those in favour of the motion .
the motion is carried .
let &apos;s move on to the department of education then and the minister of education can make his opening remarks .
opening comments for the department of education 1999-2000 main estimates
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
i have to take my glasses off because i use them as hearing aids .
mr. chairman , our staff was not readily available , but i think it won &apos;t be too difficult to deal with this department .
mr. chairman , i am pleased to present the main estimates for the department of education for the fiscal year 1999 / 2000 .
the department provides services in three areas ;
early childhood and school services ;
adult education and post secondary services ;
and income support .
i have a great interest in education and a genuine desire to serve nunavummiut .
i am committed to make this department representative , accountable and productive in its mandate .
our mission is to provide excellence in education and training opportunities that will give all nunavummiut the opportunity to learn so that they may benefit from their past and create their own futures .
this will help nunavummiut in achieving personal fulfilment and becoming a productive and prosperous society .
to achieve this , the department uses a network of publicly funded and supported day-care centres in many communities .
support to schools through funding to divisional education councils .
a network of community learning centres and regional campuses funded through nunavut arctic college .
the department also funds regional education offices that provide educational and training opportunities as well as income support services to the public .
the budget before you is a status quo budget ;
it maintains existing programs and services .
through reorganization of existing resources we will be able to streamline our operations in time .
mr. chairman , the department of education budget for the 1999-2000 fiscal year totals 138.6 million .
mr. chairman , the following are highlights from this year &apos;s budget .
mr. chairman , the income support program makes up 19 % of the department &apos;s budget .
we need to find solutions to reduce the numbers of individuals and families who rely on this funding .
my department and my colleague from sustainable development will be looking at this program this year to find ways to reducing the dependency up on income support .
capital spending this year is not at the level that was originally prepare under the gnwt 5-year capital plan .
to meet budget objectives the department used the following criteria :
projects that were already under constructionprojects that had a legal commitmentprojects wit a health or safety issue
not all projects were able to go forward this year .
the department is planning to do a capital plan stud that will address the long-term needs of our communities .
decentralization initiatives will produce the following results .
i have a small headquarters &apos; team to manage all program areas .
it is small because we have a commitment to decentralization and when fully functional will be located in three communities ;
iqaluit with 26 persons , arviat with 29 persons and baker lake with 4 .
we have staff in arviat now .
however , the office space is not ready for them and some are currently working out of their homes .
the education regional office in iqaluit will move to pangnirtung when the new office building is completed in the spring / summer of 2000 .
this will move 22 positions to pangnirtung .
the income support positions are not included in this number .
nunavut arctic college head office will be moving to rankin inlet in the fall of this year pending budget .
this will transfer 11.5 positions to that community .
with the restructuring of the three divisional education councils .
education will still maintain a regional presence .
this restructuring will be detailed over the next months in the forthcoming implementation plan .
at a recent meeting of the nunavut arctic college board of governors , a decision was made to review the structure of the college .
any restructuring will be done within the college &apos;s existing resources .
this activity will bring the college closer to the people it serves .
the college is an important component in the delivery of services to residents .
mr. chairman , the are still challenges ahead .
increasing the number of inuit throughout the department is or number one focus .
at our headquarters , inuit currently hold 7 of the 12 positions filled , or 58 % inuit employment .
mr. chairman , the department is committed to the concept of inuit qaujimajatuqangit .
i was pleased to note mr. chairman that any of the recent graduates of the aboriginal language specialist program are elders from arviat .
this is indeed good news .
elders are receiving recognition , and will make a valuable contribution to our schools and to our children .
mr. chairman , i have challenged my staff to take a leadership role in this government .
i have challenged them to deliver programs and services to citizens can benefit from their pasts and crate their own futures .
i have challenged them to find ways to allow the citizens of nunavut to achieve personal fulfilment and to promote a productive and prosperous society .
thank you mr. chairman .
&gt; &gt; applause
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister of education for nunavut .
we will now go ahead with the committee report regarding education .
mr. nutarak this is your committees &apos; department .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
i think mr. puqiqnak was going to do the opening remarks .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i don &apos;t have the inuktitut copy of the report from the committee .
okay , mr. o &apos;brien i think is going to be reading the opening remarks from the committee , or motions .
you can go ahead if you are going to be reading the motions .
report of the standing committee on culture , education and health
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
i will ask the members and the staff to bear with me , i will try to summarize where i can .
the honourable james arvaluk , minister of education and departmental officials met with the standing committee on may 1 , 1999 .
the minister spoke eloquently about his hopes for the new government of nunavut and for his department .
the standing committee appreciated the preparation by the minister and his department , which was evident at our meeting .
the members thanked him for being so open and look forward to a good working relationship with him and his staff .
business plan / operations / programs
inuit leadership in education
the standing committee reviewed the draft business plan and commends the department of education for having the most ambitious and concrete inuit employment plan .
this department has , through its ntep and other programs , been able to achieve 34 % inuit teachers , and 4 out of 42 school principals are inuit .
they want to be at 84 % inuit elementary schools and adult educator positions in 3 years .
the standing committee was deeply impressed with this department &apos;s focus on inuit leadership in their business plan and their track record in this regard .
members agree that teachers play a pivotal role in every community and have a huge influence on our children .
they are the foundation of our land and of passing on traditional knowledge to our students .
they are also community leaders and provide stability in our communities .
the more inuit community teachers , the less recruitment needed from the south and the less we will face difficulties in this regard .
the more inuit teachers who move into management , training and curriculum development , the more culturally appropriate the whole education system .
the standing committee supports the minister and the department of education for their inuit leadership plans .
the minister noted that at present , inuit teachers are almost entirely in the primary schools .
cabinet decision to abolish the regional education boards
the standing committee briefly reviewed information on the cabinet decision to abolish the regional education boards .
there were small charts projecting savings , but no details on how those numbers were generated .
there will be more accountability to the elected minister , but no complaints procedure was presented .
members wondered if the department will create an ombudsman type of person to co-ordinate and streamline complaints to the minister .
members are very concerned that this change in structure , not lay the foundation for the department in iqaluit to take control away from the communities and the regions regarding education .
members do not want iqaluit to in effect become another yellowknife , with decisions made by officials far away from the community .
will hamlets be given a position on the deas or will the membership of the deas be altered in any way ?
what will be the checks and balances in this new system , for individuals and communities with respect to their deas and the department ?
how does this affect the department &apos;s commitment to decentralization ?
members also wondered whether adult education programs would also be brought into the department .
the standing committee therefore looks forward to receiving the draft legislation and reviewing more complete implementation plans at that time .
formula for funding
standing committee members were advised that a formula inherited from the gnwt will influence the allocation of funding to each district education council for this fiscal year .
however , only a bulk number was given for each region and no further detail was provided .
this was a source of frustration to members , as noted above .
members requested detailed information on the formula for funding , by community for schools , pre-school programs and arctic college , and department committed to provide an analysis of the formula .
stay in school programs / support for people who did not complete high school
standing committee members noted that there are many people who have not completed their high school and sometimes these people are on social assistance .
they wondered what short and longer term plans the department had to stop people from dropping out of school .
at the same time , members also observed that sometimes people who may not have a lot of formal education , have excellent skills as a welder or mechanic or have traditional skills .
they wondered why more of these people in their communities are not hired by arctic college to instruct courses in their home communities to unilingual inuit .
members also want to encourage trades training to students who have not completed their high school diploma .
the minister responded that the department will be trying many new methods to encourage people to stay in school .
he also asked the members for their advice as to what sort of directive should be given to parents about their role in keeping children in school .
the standing committee members look forward to reviewing these issues and programs in the future .
adult education programs
in follow-up discussions , the standing committee expressed concerns about the success rates of arctic college students and programs .
they would like to receive information on how many students are completing the arctic college programs and how many are getting jobs in their areas of training , following graduation .
they would like to see more information on the benefits in running programs in communities , including more on the job training programs .
at the same time , members want to ensure that those students who wish to pursue post-secondary programs in southern universities and colleges are encouraged and supported .
nunavut may not be able to run some of these specialized programs at this time .
curriculum
standing committee members welcomed the announcement by the department that they will have a 10-year curriculum development plan , which will be revised on an annual basis .
the department also noted that they would be working with language specialists with cley in developing materials and that materials would be provided to the community teacher learning centres .
members know that the department of education has developed curriculum in the past that has had a strong cultural component such as inuuqatigiit and look forward to these new developments .
some concern was expressed about the need to incorporate different dialects into the curriculum development or to support local communities to adapt materials to their dialect .
members are also very supportive of inuktitut language training at all levels &#91; k-12 , arctic college , workplace &#93; , both to inuit and non-inuit .
they want these language programs widely available .
as noted above , members want to encourage all dialects to be promoted , preserved and taught .
the standing committee members look forward to hearing more about these initiatives in the future and note that the minister stated that the curriculum changes would have to be approved by the legislative assembly .
he noted that cbc and ibc also have important footage of our elders and even jurisdictions outside of nunavut have this information .
he noted that next february , the department would be looking at this and members look forward to hearing more about these ideas .
children with special needs / pre-school children
members of the standing committee had specific questions regarding the government of nunavut &apos;s plans for providing pre-school programs and for supporting children with special needs .
the minister noted that his department will be looking at these programs more in the future and members look forward to hearing more about these when information becomes available .
capital plan
there are 13 projects planned for a total value of $ 6,451,000 .
the standing committee reviewed the departments commitments for capital expenditures during this fiscal year very briefly , as members did not receive the details or inuktitut versions in time for our pre-meeting preparation .
however , members thank the department for providing inuktitut information at the time of the presentation .
the standing committee was frustrated at not being able to play more of a role in reviewing these capital proposals and had questions about priorities .
for example , how a $ 250,000 link between two buildings in one community could have priority over additional space needs for classrooms in another community .
the standing committee welcomed the department &apos;s commitment to five year and even longer term &#91; 20 year &#93; capital planning .
members wondered how each of their communities fit into the plan .
it was unclear as to the status of the gnwt five-year plan in which some communities could have expected capital projects in the near future .
members observed that there are no capital projects planned for kivalliq this year , and concerns were expressed about outstanding safety and health issues affecting schools in clyde river and gjoa haven .
the committee would also like to encourage the department to conduct an audit of what facilities are in each community .
this idea was presented by the department of health and social services and the standing committee supports it for all capital facilities .
members would like to know when schools were built or had additions , their overall condition , and how much was spent .
a question that needs to be answered is :
what is the minimum threshold that each community should have in facilities for their students ?
equitable principles need to be developed to make these decisions .

ministers &apos; statements
ministers &apos; statement 27 - 1 ( 2 ) : nunavut business incentive policy
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i rise today to provide clarification to both the members and the nunavut business community with respect to the nunavut business incentive policy .
mr. speaker , you will note that i called it the nunavut business incentive policy for it applies to nunavut businesses only .
this policy is applied specifically to the nunavut territory only .
( interpretation ends ) :
mr. speaker , i believe that this will help create new possibilities within the nunavut area which may not have been considered viable previously .
under the original business incentive policy there were instances where nunavut businesses were unable to compete directly with the well established businesses in both yellowknife and the western part of the territories .
it is my belief that the nunavut business incentive policy will help level the playing field and create potential in such areas as small scale manufacturing and industry .
mr. speaker , this creates additional opportunities in our communities which may not have been previously viable .
the original business incentive policy was established by the government of nwt in 1984 .
the principle function of this policy was to enable northern firms to compete on an equal footing with southern firms in bidding for goods and services in the north .
the high cost of maintaining a business in the north made this a necessity .
mr. speaker , by adopting the nunavut business incentive policy , our intent is to assist nunavut businesses to develop and grow .
this is a very important factor in ensuring that doing business within nunavut , benefits the people of nunavut .
mr. speaker , this will result in increased economic activity and employment opportunities at the local level as businesses expand to meet the requirements within nunavut .
presently there are 383 approved firms listed in the registry for the nunavut area .
this number is comprised of : 50 firms in the kitikmeot , 132 firms in the keewatin and 201 firms in the baffin .
the complete list is located on the world wide web at :
www.kirk.nt.ca / nubip .
mr. speaker , let me reassure all members that the nunavut business incentive policy is in effect for the period of april 1 , 1999 to march 31 , 2000 .
during this transition period a review will be undertaken in order to see how the policy can be tailored to meet the specific requirements of nunavut and article 24 .
mr. speaker , this review will involve nti and other interested stakeholders in order to ensure that we can obtain maximum input in developing a &quot; made in nunavut &quot; policy .
mr. speaker , as the minister responsible for public works , telecommunications &amp; technical services , i look forward to this review and encourage all interested parties to participate .
this can only lead to greater benefits and economic opportunities in nunavut .
thank you mr. speaker .

ministers &apos; statement 28 - 1 ( 2 ) :
sustainable development &apos;s new inuktitut name
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , today i want to unveil our department &apos;s official new inuktitut name .
we have searched long and hard for this name , trying to capture in a single name the diverse functions of our department .
and many different names for sustainable development were put forward .
some names that circulated around included :
pivalliajulirijikkut ; annaumaqatigiit pilirijingit and many others .
today i am pleased to announce , mr. speaker , the new official inuktitut name for our department :
ikupigvilirijikkut .
this term comes from old inuktitut , and is well understood by our elders .
this word , ikupik , means :
to receive food or assistance to tide you over .
we are a department where the nunavut residents can access funds , technical information for community based planning , and other programs for our communities .
this name , ikupigvilirijikkut , fits us rather well .
and the term is understood by the kitikmeot , kivallirmiut and the qikiqtaalungmiut .
mr. speaker , when sports hunting became possible , one of the regulations was that all sports hunting of polar bears would be conducted using only a dogteam .
as the inuit hunters started rebuilding dog teams one of the unexpected results was old inuktitut terms , not in use for a long time , had to be revived .
this term , ikupingniq , has not been used in a while and the majority of the younger generation is not aware of its meaning .
i am extremely pleased that we have also reclaimed this term for today &apos;s inuktitut .
mr. speaker , i now unveil our department of sustainable development logo to my colleagues :
ikupiktulirijikkut .
these three circles represent our environment , our economy , and the people .
our department continually strives to integrate and balance these three aspects of nunavut .
i would like to express my gratitude to our elders , and especially ollie ittinuar of rankin inlet for suggesting our inuktitut name and giving us the definition .
thank you mr. ittinuar .
thank you mr. speaker .

members &apos; statement 84 - 1 ( 2 ) :
hall beach school addition
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker , i woke up in a very good way today .
if my wife and children can see me i would like to tell them that i love them .
this is an urgent matter because we are experiencing population growth .
we don &apos;t even have grade 12 .
the school was built without a grade 12 classroom and the school is overcrowded .
for this upcoming school season there will be 221 students going into our school and there are only ten classrooms , and it is cause a concern because of safety reasons .
in regards to safety and health codes the school will be overcrowded .
mr. speaker , tomorrow i will be tabling a petition in regards to this issue .
thank you mr. speaker .

use of government facilities by contractor
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i have a return to an oral question asked by mr. irqittuq on may 25 , 1999 regarding use of government facilities by contractors .
there are no public works , ... my goodness , my department &apos;s name is long ...
&gt; &gt; laughter
... telecommunications &amp; technical services facilities being used by any contractors .
there is a deal where the contractor building the hall beach water reservoir is using arctic airport facilities for specialized heavy equipment repairs .
in return , they agreed to provide gravel to arctic airports for their needs .
thank you mr. speaker .

item 6 :
oral questions
question 166 - 1 ( 2 ) :
bussing in iqaluit
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question is for the minister responsible for education .
mr. speaker , on the 19th i made a members &apos; statement regarding bussing in iqaluit . on the 25th i asked questions regarding bussing in iqaluit .
mr. speaker , i would like to ask the minister if he is now aware of any issues relating to the need for bussing here in iqaluit .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister responsible for education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. speaker .
yes , i am aware of the additional bussing requirements for the coming school year .
we are in discussion with the dea right now and this is a direct responsibility of the baffin education council .
in those discussions , they are to make the funding formula available , when the school figures are finalized in this spring and summer .
also there is a discussion on if the times can be staggered so that existing facilities can be used , or utilized better .
these are ongoing discussions , i appreciate the members &apos; question and we will be working on that as hard as we can to resolve it before the next school year .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
oral questions , mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
however they do receive their funding through the department of education and i believe they have been trying to seek additional funds required for the bussing that is needed in iqaluit .
mr. speaker , the minister also discussed the option of looking at staggered times . that is already in place mr. speaker , all the schools start at different times .
i have them here and i can tell you , if you want , but they are already doing that .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. speaker .
the member knows that in the budget session , we cannot commit single handily for additional resources to purchase two more buses that have been identified by the member .
however i will assure the member that my department ; i have told my department to work with the education authorities to find the most suitable way to resolve that problem .
all of these have been under discussion and i am waiting for my department to give me the most suitable way to resolve that .
i don &apos;t want to undermine the best recommendations that they could give me , in the meantime .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
oral questions , mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
all these other options have already been looked at , they have been doing it for some time .
mr. speaker , next fall we are going to have a problem .
the only way to accommodate that , after thorough review by the dea , by the education council , is going to be the requirement to have additional buses .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. speaker .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
final supplementary mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i can appreciate the ministers &apos; remarks and i look forward to addressing this issue along with a few other ones in the committee of the whole .
hopefully we can get this problem resolved so that we don &apos;t see kids walking in cold weather .
also i would just like to ask the minister , he had mentioned if they would qualify based on the funding formula .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
mr. speaker , all programs and services of the department that were inherited from the gnwt are subject to review .
we cannot deem to be 100 % satisfied just having gnwt programs that were inherited by nunavut government .
speaker :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
oral questions .
mr. irqittuq .
question 167 - 1 ( 2 ) :
use of government facilities by private business
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
regarding the reply i just received , i have another question on the same subject .
i would like a clear answer .
perhaps i should be asking this to the minister of finance , i don &apos;t want to embarrass ms. thompson , even though it is regarding the same subject that she just replied to .
i am asking the government if i can just go to the garage staff and tell them that i can remove the snow for you if i can use your facility and your tools .
so i can make an agreement of that kind for public works , telecommunications &amp; technical services facilities ?
speaker :
mr. ng , minister of finance .
hon. kelvin ng :
mr. speaker , the responsibility for gn capital assets rests with the department of public works , so i will ask the appropriate minister to respond .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. ng .
ms. thompson , minister for public works , telecommunications &amp; technical services .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
regarding the question being asked by the member for hall beach , let me tell him first that i am not embarrassed by his remark , contrary to his suggestion .
i looked into this matter earlier and i looked into whether or not public works , telecommunications &amp; technical services made a mistake with the contractor in hall beach building the water reservoir .
they are not using our facilities .
by the way , the arctic airports &apos; facility is not under my ministerial responsibility but it is up to these two organizations to make agreements for such a service .
i can further respond by saying that i had a short discussion with the minister responsible for arctic airports , mr. anawak , this morning , regarding this .
i don &apos;t know if he has had a chance to communicate what we talked about with his officials yet .
i made my response earlier based on the information that i was able to obtain .
there was an agreement between arctic airports and the contractor .
this facility is not under my responsibility .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
oral questions , mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i have another question along the same line .
i don &apos;t know , or i have not seen , who requires gravel in hall beach although i am from that community .
the road between the airport and the community belongs to arctic airports and it is in good order .
i don &apos;t know mr. speaker , maybe i should ask this question , who was requiring this gravel from arctic airports and where this gravel would be used .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i have no details about how this gravel would be used .
even though our department awarded this contract , arctic airports operations are not under my department .
i think that arctic airports can be asked where this gravel was going to be used .
once the contract was awarded it is no longer under my ministerial responsibilities .
perhaps this question should be asked to mr. anawak .
speaker :
thank you ms. thompson .
the subject is changing here , we were talking about whether the contractor could work in the warehouse , the original question did not talk about moving of gravel to certain places .
oral questions , mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i just want clarification about that , i am not talking about gravel , but that is mentioned in the reply made by the minister .
my question is whether or not they are going to be looking into the details sometime this week regarding this contract .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
are you directing this question to the same minister , mr. irqittuq ?
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
mr. speaker .
yes , i wanted to know if this minister will speak with the transportation minister about this .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
minister responsible for public works , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i understand exactly what the member is talking about and i will have further discussions with him as to what further details he may need .
i can also find out what the gravel is to be used for .
i will also be having a discussion with minister anawak , and we will give a clear reply to the member and try to give that right away .
we will try to give these answers before friday .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. thompson .
mr. mclean ..
question 168 - 1 ( 2 ) :
ambulance services in nunavut
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. speaker .
yesterday mr. speaker , in committee of the whole i was so infatuated with the honourable ministers &apos; story about the newfoundland tooth fairy , that i forgot to ask a question .
in regards to ambulance service in nunavut . mr. speaker , my question to the minister is , is he developing any kind of ambulance policy for the residents of nunavut .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
minister of health , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , the member is a little bit mistaken , indeed there was no talk about tooth fairies , indeed it was tooth charmers , there is a considerable difference .
on the ambulance policy , mr. speaker , depending on operational requirements , for example , in a community like iqaluit there is an ambulance service provided through the town itself .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
rephrase your question mr. mclean , i will allow you the same question .
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. speaker .
my community is sort of distressed that we don &apos;t have that type and level of service that they do have in the large regional centres .
will the minister please answer me , if nunavut government has a policy in regards to providing ambulance services to the rest of us ?
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
minister of health , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
some other communities are a long distance away from the airport .
for example in arctic bay the airport is 25 kilometres away from the community itself .
so under the direction of the department do we have a specific policy for ambulances per community ?
no .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
oral questions , mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
mr. speaker , i think that i am getting the answer that i want .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :

minister of health , minister picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
thank you mr. speaker .

oral questions . oral questions .
mr. kattuk .
question 169 - 1 ( 2 ) :
local accommodation policy
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i was going to ask this question yesterday but we ran out of time .
this question will be directed to the minister of public works , telecommunications &amp; technical services , the honourable ms. thompson .
the gnwt had a policy requiring the use local hotels , by contractors , when they were available .
they were required to use the local hotel facilities to accommodate their workers who came to work in our community .
i wonder if that policy is still in place .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kattuk .
the minister of public works , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) : thank you mr. speaker .
they are prevented from building their own accommodation facility , so the policy is still in place , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. thompson .
mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question to the same minister on the same subject .
so when there is a contract in the same community , the contractors who are based in the communities , are we still going to see importation of private contractors .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
the contractors i think all know the hiring policy , for example .
communities like sanikiluaq have the same opportunity to bid on contracts and we can further give a reminder of this issue to contractors .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. thompson .
mr. iqaqrialu .
question 170 - 1 ( 2 ) : restoration of construction sites
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
perhaps this question is directed to the minister of transportation .
the sites for building construction are drilled using piles and the access roads that are built near these sites are absolutely ruined .
i wonder if those areas are going to be restored following the drilling of piles .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister of transportation , mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
the community governments such as hamlets are responsible for that area .
i know that many communities are concerned about restoration of access roads and site restoration .
i think that hamlets should be considering how they should do that .
i think the municipal governments are in a better position to talk with the member about that rather than my department .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .

mr. tootoo .
question 171 - 1 ( 2 ) : members &apos; input to housing committee
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question is directed to the minister responsible for community government , housing &amp; transportation .
mr. speaker , i am sure that we were all pleased yesterday to hear his announcement of his corrections planning committee .
mr. speaker , this justice committee was a nice surprise , but that again was what it was , mr. speaker , a surprise .
i would like to ask the minister if he plans on seeking any input from regular members prior to anything happening with the housing committee .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of justice , mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
in regards to the corrections committee that was struck , i believe that was done way back in october .
the assistant deputy minister initiated this process on her own prior to the nunavut government coming about .
i would like to tell the regular members that yes , regarding input on housing , that &apos;s what i said and that &apos;s what i am going to do .
right after this session we are going to start working and i will make sure that i will consult with the regular members even when we are back in our constituency .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. anawak .
oral questions , mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , am i correct in hearing that the minister is saying that he has not yet started work on this committee to look at housing .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of justice , mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i just said that the corrections committee that was already formed was operating long before april 1 .
as well as social housing . so as i said , there have been discussions ongoing but on the actual issue of the makeup i will be consulting with the regular members before commencing .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
oral questions , mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i guess what i have been planning on all along is not only the makeup of this committee but also actually what the committee will be looking at .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of housing , mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker . ... as an inuk , when we say we want to work together , we mean just that ;
working together . i am not trying to put hidden meaning into the comments when i say that i am going to work and seek input from the regular members ...
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
sorry , i think the interpreters were on a different channel .
oral questions mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker , i missed the majority of what he said , technical problems i guess .
if i could just ask the minister if he could repeat .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. anawak . please repeat .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
like i said , i said that i would seek input from the regular members and i am going to follow through on what i said .
we haven &apos;t put together what the committees are going to be doing and when we start that process , we will be seeking your input .
they will be getting input from the public and others .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
before we proceed i would like to recognize mr. pauloosie paniloo who used to be a member of the legislative assembly for baffin central .

thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
minister responsible for income support , mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) : i apologize mr. speaker i wasn &apos;t listening ;
i thought the question was directed to another minister .
but in regards to the income support policy that is done through sustainable development .
we are presently doing a review of the whole policy issue .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kilabuk .
mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
the reason why i am asking is that the recipients receive a cheque and some of the money is used to pay for rent .
they have a hard time keeping up with their budget .
speaker :
thank you mr. alakannuark , mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
in regards to your question we are presently doing a review in regards to the monthly payments .
we are presently reviewing it and we have already identified some of the problems that we have with this program .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kilabuk .
mr. kattuk
question 173 - 1 ( 2 ) :
dog picked up by charter a mystery
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question is for the minister of justice , in my community , well it &apos;s not really a major concern , but a source of wonder .
that &apos;s my question mr. speaker .
speaker : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kattuk .
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i guess i didn &apos;t make it clear the first time , but i thought the letter of explanation was sent to the mayor of sanikiluaq .
the rcmp were going down to sanikiluaq anyway when this happened .
i could talk to you further personally afterwards about this .
speaker : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
mr. iqaqrialu .
question 174 - 1 ( 2 ) :
support for unilingual businesspersons
mr. iqaqrialu : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i would like to direct my question to sustainable development .
regarding economic development ;
starting your own business is cumbersome especially to the inuktitut unilingual &apos;s who have to go through a lot of barriers set up when you try to apply through the business program .
are you going to be making any changes .
speaker : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister of sustainable development mr. kilabuk
hon. peter kilabuk : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i will be talking about this later when my department takes their turn at the witness table , we are presently working on it .
in regards to the applications for business loans or business grants , most of the problems was that there were so many programs set under one department .
we are presently reviewing the process on what we can put it in one part instead of having them all separated .
people out there can apply through this one process and that would be set up at the community level , will presently try to set up the system .
speaker : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kilabuk .
mr. nutarak
question 175 - 1 ( 2 ) :
three ministers dealing with income support
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
when we were having a committee meeting , dealing with income support , one of the questions that was brought up was if they &apos;re going to be reviewing the guidelines for the regulations .
it creates a problem when your trying to ask question regarding the income support program because so many ministers &apos; are responsible for it .
speaker : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
mr. okalik
hon. paul okalik :
( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker . like the minister said it is presently under review and we &apos;re looking at the how it can be better set up for nunavut .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. okalik .
mr. o &apos;brien .
question 176 - 1 ( 2 ) :
artifact repatriation
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. speaker . my question is directed to minister of cley , in relation to community such as mine ;
i &apos;m wondering if the minister can speak this as to how the communities can get some of these pieces of history back in their community .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister responsible for culture language and elders and youth mr. havioyak
hon. donald havioyak : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i am quite happy that you ask that question , because we are trying to get everybody involved in what is happening .
the only way we can work together is by sharing ideas and we will be doing this in all the communities of nunavut today .
for an example if you are in arviat that you would be working directly with the people of arviat and we can start sharing ideas .
as i stated before we have to share ideas in order to compete what we would like to do .
thank you
speaker : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. havioyak .
mr. o &apos;brien
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. speaker .
by creating a large archive here in iqaluit , i would assume that many of the artifacts would then be taken from the smaller communities and put in this large centre here .
i &apos;d like the minister to speak to this how he would see this supporting the smaller that would like to see their artifacts stay in their community .
there &apos;s many elders that will never have an opportunity to happen to come here to iqaluit to visit an archives here or to go to yellowknife , where the archives located now .
so how do you see this fitting in to the communities needs , the smaller communities that is .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien . minister of culture , language elders and youth , mr. havioyak
hon. donald havioyak :
( interpretation ) :
thank you .
speaker : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. havioyak .
mr. o &apos;brien
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. speaker .
there having difficulties doing this and they &apos;d like to get them back before some of the elders pass away , so they can review these tapes and so on .
so i &apos;d like the minister look in to this to see if he can help us assist facilitate these artifacts coming back to the community in the very near future .
thank you
speaker : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. havioyak
hon. donald havioyak :
thank you mr. speaker .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. havioyak .

oral question , mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :

mr. speaker i don &apos;t know if i asked to the wrong person .
that community is going to have to pay for it and if the results of that mean that the rates are going to increase in that community .

thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
just a reminder , when you &apos;re asking a question you have to ask the same minister .if you have different question you can direct it to different minister .
mr. tootoo would you rephrase your ... or which minister are you directing it to .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
i &apos;d like to direct it to which ever minister , i don &apos;t know who can appropriately answer the question .

speaker :
thank you .
minister responsible for human resources &amp; finance mr. ng
hon. kelvin ng :

mr. speaker as my a honourable colleague mr. picco would say , indeed the member raises a good point .

we have a significant investments and significant impact in respect of the cost .
thank you mr. speaker .

thank you mr. ng .

we are now into general comments and questions .
general comments .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
( interpretation ends ) we are going to review all of the formula funding methods and practices etc . , for the next year and we will start proceeding with that .
as i stated this morning everything is up for review and this is one of them .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , another question i have is in the minister &apos;s opening address he mentioned the highlights in this year &apos;s budget being 17 new teaching positions across nunavut .
mr. chairperson , i would like to ask the minister if this is indeed 17 new teachers over this years current staffing levels .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
yes .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
right now we don &apos;t .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i am sorry if i am trying to jam these through but i am on a tight time frame here .
as i discussed earlier this morning , i don &apos;t know if the minister has had a chance to get updated on the bussing here in iqaluit .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
mr. chairman , for that detail i would like to have my deputy minister answer that .
chairperson :
mr. moody , i hope that i said your name properly
mr. moody :
thank you .
yes it is an additional amount to the original capital project .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo , any additional comments .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
the original idea was to eventually transfer them over to sustainable development for the delivery .
we are now in discussions because i am told that some of the computers that are used in the communities are not y2k compatible .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
just a couple more questions regarding the ministers &apos; opening statement .
he had also indicated in there that the department uses publicly funded day care centres .
i am just wondering mr. chairman are the day cares under this departments &apos; jurisdiction or would they fall under a different department .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
i am not completely up to date because it was a federal program before .
for those details i would like to ask my adm to answer that .
chairperson :
go ahead , assistant deputy minister levi .
ms. levi ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
the child care program which we adopted from the gnwt , we are administering that at the moment as part of the department of education .
this is a year to year program and we are administering it up to date .
some of the funding for start-up costs comes from the federal government , and we are responsible for administering the licensing of these facilities .
thank you .
chairperson :
thank you .
if you have questions or general comments , you should indicate now because i only have two names listed .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
there is one more question and then a brief comment and i will be done on the opening address .
in there the minister indicated that arctic college will be moving to rankin inlet in the fall pending budget .
i am just wondering if the minister could maybe clarify what he meant by that .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairperson :
which one of you will be responding .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
we have not been able to find funding to do the transfer .
we are still in the process , i would like to have the deputy minister explain further .
chairperson :
mr. moody .
mr. moody :
thank you .
there is an expense associated with the move to rankin inlet .
the exact number of people that arctic college wish to move is being solidified , i understand in the next few weeks , from recent conversations with the president .
then we will look within our budget to see if there are funds to assist the college with that .
in the normal grant that we provide to the college there is no monies for that , it is a special one-time item .
we have to attempt to find that .
the first step will be to solidify the numbers , which we are advised will be in the next couple of weeks , and then we will look for the dollar amount .
so i think it is fair to say at this time that we can &apos;t say for sure when that move date might be .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
just a final comment before i pass the torch on to whoever else is next .
mr. chairman , i learned that nunavut has the highest pupil teacher ratio in canada , mr. chairman .
chairperson :
that was just a comment .
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
the older students were able to go out on the land with funding from the department of education .
these funds were for gasoline etc , but that program was phased out .
i wonder what the position of the government of nunavut is about reinstating these programs .
i wonder what is happening with that program , i saw it before and it was very beneficial , mr. chairman .
the students were able to get hands on training through that program and i think it was valuable for the long term education of the young people .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
we are always experiencing a shortage of funding in traditional programs . we tried to divide up the funds for in school instruction and also for traditional land skills and traditional clothing education .
we tried to divide funds which were already short and we have continued with these programs in spite of the cuts .
thank you for the ministers &apos; response . i feel personally that these types of programs are very valuable to the well being of the young people .
being from the north sometimes we have 24 hour darkness and it is only when we have longer days that the young people are able to take advantage of these programs .
we have a unique situation in the north where we experience 24 hour darkness and our children have to experience many hours in the class rooms .
that erodes the ability of the young people to survive out on the land .
this is just a general comment mr. chairman , i have another question that i would like to ask .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. puqiqnak go ahead .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
this seems to be the legislation and the department of education .
once our child is sixteen there is much more flexibility before they are sixteen but after that they are treated differently .
it is no longer mandatory .
i wonder if your department can look into this some time in the near future in the new government .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
in inuit society , even when they are older we treat them as children , and that is why our department is trying to prepare to work with parents on what their requirements are .
we want to work with the parents .
the department of education is not a parent on its &apos; own and should not be working on its &apos; own .
as parents we have a responsibility towards our children , to provide for them , not just in education .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
go ahead , mr. puqiqnak any further questions .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
i believe that the numbers for this year are 6.4 million dollars in the capital budget .
most cases that would just barely build a new school .
chairperson :
which one of you will be responding to that .
which of the witnesses .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
we will have to make capital plans that reflect the growing population of nunavummiut , for example , arviat .
i think after this year , after the initial decentralization program that we will have a better handle on exactly what the population growth of the children will be .
i think that will stabilize and it will be better for predicting or forecasting capital requirements for different communities .
how do we reduce dependency on the government in the long run .
these will have to be looked at .
i don &apos;t think this government can afford to do a long term band aid of the problems , i don &apos;t think we can afford that .
we tried that with the gnwt and it didn &apos;t work very well .
we will have to have a better handle on forecasting what the population growth , especially of the children are .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
mr. chairman , looking at the history of the requested or required capital dollars for education in the past ; it has been approximately fifteen million dollars .
but that does not mean that this is a total requirement .
because since the high school introduction in the communities the requirement also have increased and there may be other requirements in the education field , for example ;
if that is adapted by this legislative assembly then the requirement will jump significantly .
so it &apos;s not , until such time legislative assembly directs the government and ultimately the department of education then we will have to use the status quo for next year .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
just a brief question .
i would like the minister or one of the staff to tell me of the 27 jobs that are , i guess , they &apos;re going to be in place for my community .
when can we expect those jobs to be in place fully filled in my community .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman is it fair to say that the tie-up with these jobs been filled is the fact that the office building is not available at this point and time ?
if that the major factor for the delay ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
mr. chairman , that &apos;s a little bit of detail but i &apos;d like to have my deputy minister to answer that .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. moody .
mr. moody :
mr. chairman . we have been progressing to fill those position regardless of the fact that the office building has not been finished .
the initial hold-up was the fact that there was limited funds to hire new staff in the fiscal year that we just ended .
but we have now hired and we have four people in the arviat operation here place today and in fact three of the individuals are here on in-service in iqaluit this week .
we are currently recruiting for additional positions for arviat .
so regardless of when the building will open we will actually continue to recruit .
it is unfortunate that it is not open today but we &apos;re not letting that hold us up .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
can the minister tell me , i &apos;ve been through the building , a few weeks ago when i was home , and it looked fairly complete to me .
what is the tie-up and when can we expect to move people into that building .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
it looks complete even by telephone , but can &apos;t telephone there .
telephone , fax those kind of equipment , essentials are not complete but i &apos;m told that they would be completed by after 1st of july .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
just second part of my question is it fair to assume that after the phone systems are installed that at that point we can then more people this new building ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
yes , we hope that by after 1st of july then we will start recruiting as much as we can get in those competitions and transfers etc .
etc .
that we would like to have that done around that time . thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. o &apos;brien . mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
this is my last question , comment .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
that &apos;s right , that &apos;s true , that &apos;s the number we have been told any other directive from the government to do likewise .
that &apos;s the number we have .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman my question is about the students who have graduated in grade 12 who would like to attend university but usually there is no funding for students to attend universities .
what is the status of assistance for students who liked to go down to universities .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
there are different ways of sponsoring students according to the university they &apos;re attending .
i would like ian rose to elaborate .
ian rose .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
ian rose .
mr. rose :
there are a number of programs that can we use .
for most students attending southern university receiving a funding through the student financial assistance program .
students would apply to the department for their funding depending upon whether they are a single student or a student with dependants their level of funding would be based on that scale .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i have another question .
to have that kind of training in the communities would be very valuable .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
yes .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. mclean , you &apos;re up .
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. chairman .
i going to go back , i try to keep to 10 minutes , but i might get carried away here .
it nice to see everybody here , armed and dangerous with paper .
the capital planning process has been involved in deas and regional education authorities for the last decade .
i &apos;m going to do a bit of history here because we all have a tendency to say in kabluna talk that history repeats itself .
and i &apos;m hoping now that its nunavut that history won &apos;t repeat itself .
the past finance minister negotiated our formula finance agreement with the thought of decentralization in mind .
unfortunately when he was negotiating with the federal government on decentralization in foreman financing agreement he must have been asleep in regards to capital projects .
i go through the wish list from the department from bob moody and there is something like 16 , 17 school extensions or renovations planned in the next 3 to 4 years .
i &apos;m just throwing a ball park figure out there because all renovations in new buildings are different .
conservative estimate is that we &apos;re going to need close to one hundred fifty million dollars .
that &apos;s just my estimate .
and like i say they &apos;re conservative .
to get nunavut up to where it should be for our booming population that we hear so much about .
so you have momentous task on your hands to find one hundred fifty million dollars for school facilities alone and that doesn &apos;t really take in the adult education facilities .
our capital plan this year is fifty five million dollars total and i think there is ten million dollars for schools .
so the plan ahead of us and with our finance minister at the helm we &apos;ve got a monumental task ahead of us in regards to putting in schools at communities that deserve them .
now in the past , it wasn &apos;t necessarily the case in the region that i live in . that schools were given to communities in need , in dire need .
it was done on political will , just before election time .
a member :
name one .
mr. mclean :
exactly , and i don &apos;t want to pick on another community or anything like that . but rankin inlet has a school that was built as a regional high school .
the mani uluyuk school with the capacity of 451 students and it has 185 in there .
the leo ussak elementary school was built for the capacity of 374 and they have 255 .
so i think their capacity in rankin inlet is 30 to 40 % .
where as i know if we went around to the other schools in the region the capacity is anywhere from 85 to 120 % .
so i &apos;m getting back to standards and criteria in need .
and in the government in yellowknife always didn &apos;t have the true figures of what populations were in the school , because i watched it and studied it .
and being member of this government and seen what happened in the past i &apos;m going to keep this government to it .
i really am .
if a school needs to be built in a certain community it should be built there .
if a renovation has to be built in a certain community it should be built there .
they shouldn &apos;t be built at politicians whims as they were in the past .
i &apos;m not blaming you guys this is new .
we &apos;re all in this together and i &apos;m going to see to it . so when i do my 10 minutes let me go but i want to go into other things .
the school populations right now in the keewatin there was a 15 % influx of students into the keewatin schools this year and the funding was status quo .
so 15 % of 2,200 students is roughly 300 so the important of the finance , i should have been at least 15 new teachers hired this year .
i know you guys are dealing with the budget and i know we &apos;re all concerned about education .
not in all cases .
and i know we &apos;re looking at the poor minister of finance there and we &apos;re saying we need for money for education .
bussing , we inherit this bussing policy from the west .
this bussing policy was formulated in the west based on whatever .
it was based on their climate .
they would give us a certain amount of money to the divisional board in the keewatin for 4 months of the year the 4 coldest months .
well , the 4 coldest months in yellowknife or hay river are not necessarily the 4 coldest months in arctic bay , iqaluit , or baker lake .
we went to the point where we hosted bingo &apos;s and did fund-raising to make the bussing schedule fit the needs of the community .
and we fortunately were successful in paying enough money through fund-raising , binges , and through our contribution for regional education council to provide bussing year round .
inuit educators ; i &apos;ve been they &apos;ve been sadly neglected in the last 7 or 8 years .
saying that they had 40 million dollars to train people to work in the nunavut government at various levels of management or what ever , what ever , what ever .
well , its just to advice you so you can advise your high school students and other people in the community .
and i says well , what about a classroom assistant that &apos;s worked in a classroom for 10 or 15 years , taken a tep course , got here b.
like to me that was injustice , terrible injustice to probably the most committed group of individuals in our education system and like i say again there are certain number of dollars going around .
the more help they have the better our education system will be .
and i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll look at that mr. minister because i know you &apos;re involved in education and is concerned about it as i am .
your staff ;
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. mclean , your time is up . you may ask another question .
or you can ask another question to you and ask if you can have general consensus in order to go over your time .
proceed .
mr. mclean :
thank you . mr. chairman and my fellow colleagues .
i &apos;ll end it right now .
i just want to see more people out in the field .
we &apos;re supposed to be closer to the government .
i &apos;d like to get mr. rose out in the keewatin .
murray used to live there .
it helps being in a region , in the keewatin , where the board office is in the community .
but the biggest complaint from the staff was they never saw the staff of the board office in their school .
they were always out travelling around .
that &apos;s it .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
did you want to make a response ?
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
i know exactly where you &apos;re coming from .
i would also like to thank him .
i &apos;m sure that we will not want to repeat his traces because of the inconsistencies and so on .
so right now i would like to be very open .
we &apos;d like to look as how we can improve the education system , openly amongst ourselves and we will also have to realize that there is a limit to the money .
so we have to use , look at how we can best use our money effectively for the people of nunavut .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
do you have another question mr. mclean ?
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
his opening remarks yesterday , he said that he would like to see education closer to the people of to the communities of nunavut .
can you clarify that point .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you . mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
the arctic college .
i think some people think that arctic college is here in iqaluit , ft . smith , far away and it &apos;s something that &apos;s foreign to the people of nunavut .
i can use an example of arctic college etep students .
they &apos;re taking their training at arctic college but the arctic college is community based .
that &apos;s the perception that the people have out there .
so i would like to get arctic college a little bit closer to the communities so that there can be dialogue between the people and arctic college and the board of governors for example .
those are the ideas that we have .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
yes , that &apos;s a part of , it &apos;s a part of what we &apos;re doing now .
so we have to get planned ahead so that we can put people into those into the provision of these services .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
it &apos;s not a question but it &apos;s regarding the arctic college that &apos;s in my home community .
it &apos;s very , very small and it seems like nobody &apos;s given it a second thought so the adult education for the arctic college in pond inlet has to be renovated .
chairperson ( interpretation ) : mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
okay we &apos;ll look into it . chairperson :
mr. nutarak . mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
okay , my last comment . yesterday in your opening remarks there was twenty-six point one million dollars i believe .
i &apos;m sure were going to talk about it when we get into the main estimates .
do you give out those monies on a per capita basis or how do you , what &apos;s the formula .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
any one of you . mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
i have exactly no idea how its set .
it &apos;s on a per capita basis .
i &apos;ll get our assistant deputy minister to elaborate on this .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
ms. levi .
ms. levi ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
in regards to the income support , the regulations are and policies are dealt with by the sustainable development and we handle the operations portion .
some of our employees work through the hamlet councils and some through our departments .
the community &apos;s are given a pys .
there has been no change in the salaries and benefits .
even if they are working under the hamlet councils , the same rules or policies apply .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
if they do more than service clients , we are also looking at whether they could also be there to provide employment services .
chairperson :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
first of all i would like to make a comment about the provision of buses in the communities .
i believe that is a concern all over nunavut .
we do have a bus in sanikiluaq but it cannot be used for all the students .
some of the people bring in students with skidoos and other modes of transportation and i believe that it is like that all over the communities .
a man will bring his kids to school first instead of going out hunting or delaying their hunting trip so that they can bring their children to school .
it is more of a comment , but my question is in regards to the dea &apos;s .
it has been quite a while now since they had to use the money for specific purposes .
i would like to know if there is going to be money given to the dea &apos;s that they can use at their discretion .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
we do have a policy , maybe ian can elaborate on it further .
chairperson :
mr. rose .
so monies can be moved around and re-profiled within the areas . chairperson :
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson : mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson : i have two names here on the list and one member is allowed ten minutes , would you like to take a break right now or would you like to go on .
okay , let &apos;s take a five minute break . &gt; &gt; committee recessed at 2.38 and resumed at 2.54 pm .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you for returning to the table .
right now mr. iqaqrialu has a question .
mr. arvaluk , you raised your hand first , you may speak .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
ms. levi has to go to gjoa haven tonight so i had to get a replacement .
this is murray horn , who deals with capital and especially finances , and phoebe hainak is also here .
i would like to welcome them .
as we mentioned earlier we have an employee from arviat , ms. joy suluk , she is the nunavut education development officer .
david freeman , information officer for adult education programs , and nancy highland is also a manager .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
welcome to the meeting .
we can start mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i am glad you have your staff with you .
first of all i would like to make a comment in relation to my community .
at present we are above average in looking at the population of nunavut , clyde river is the highest rate of students on a yearly basis .
because of this i would like to request more funding for bussing services for my community .
i know that there are a number of people from my community who would like to attend university or secondary education .
i would like to request that clyde river be a community base for arctic college or for a university for the future .
the funding that is designated for secondary education programs are usually managed in iqaluit so it becomes cumbersome for the small communities .
i was wondering whether that will still be the case .
i will raise another question after you respond .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
i noticed two questions but i will answer the first question first .
i would like every member to know that we will not be dealing with these kinds of issues alone as a department .
we will be consulting the appropriate agencies and the regular members as well as the whole education system .
at this moment we are assessing all of those programs and policies .
after the divisional boards are dissolved then we will be able to give more authority to the community education committees , so they would be able to make decisions that effect them directly .
so in that manner we will be hiring appropriate people for the positions in the communities .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
thank you . mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i believe that we will be consulted appropriately and you will not be making decisions alone as a department .
perhaps the elders that are being consulted as experts , perhaps they should be hired as expert consultants by arctic college , in nunavut .
i know that we can make the system better for the people in that manner .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
so during our review we will be developing a streamline , a baseline to pay through contract , perhaps we can hire the inuit consultants .
we still have to review those areas and we will be doing them more in the future .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
i understand what you are saying but the teachers have to have certification or a diploma in order to teach elementary or secondary levels .
i know that in the future inuit teachers will have to get more education .
when the teachers don &apos;t have diplomas , even though they have more experience they don &apos;t fix their income appropriately and it has effected the staff in the education system .
the morale of the staff have been impacted by that .
even though they are paid appropriately the higher costs of living makes everything too expensive .
i will ask this question again .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
this will have to be clearer to the people .
individuals who have completed their schooling , when they have ba &apos;s or diplomas , they are formally recognized as being educated .
for instance the same thing as trade school , we know that even though they have completed their schooling they don &apos;t know how to read inuktitut .
they cannot teach in inuktitut , so because they are being taught in a very specific area .
even though they have teachers &apos; certificates or diplomas it doesn &apos;t mean that they are qualified on every aspect .
they are taught how to teach and for instance , it depends on which programs they are taking .
it can be extended into whatever areas they are taking .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i was more concerned about the wages that are being paid to classroom assistants and others who are not certified .
are you going to be looking into that as well .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
mr. chairman , i don &apos;t think that i said a certificate or a diploma has nothing to do with the wages that are being paid .
people are paid according to their qualifications and in their specialized areas .
we will be looking at that and would like to finish that in the not too distant future .
that is one of our targets to review all of these areas and we &apos;ll be consulting with the mla &apos;s and members of the public when we are doing the review .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i am glad to hear that .
those of us who have not completed grade 12 .
i think that we need to communicate to the people how important it is to go beyond grade 12 because they are not trained to take on jobs .
i think that people are finding it a disappointment that after spending all of these years getting your grade 12 , they are still not able to get employment .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
yes , grade 12 is often the minimum education for getting employment .
they have to have a certain level of math a certain level of english programs .
let us remember that what we have learned from our parents was hard .
that was an education in their own way and we were taught to survive in that environment .
what we are seeing right now is students even though they have grade 12 , their basic knowledge is only what they have learned in the classroom .
because we are working people , we are not teaching our children as our fathers and mothers did when we were children .
so we have to say that , and telling our children to get their grade 12 so that further education will be available to them , either through the college or through the university .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
these are essential to survival in the north and by incorporating the present curriculum along with traditional type programs they would complement each other .
i will stop at this point but i may have another question again later on before we are finished .
thank you mr. chairman
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
that &apos;s why we have to review what should included in there and what kind of specialized people we need to teach that probably in our department .
i think nowdlak and other people working in that area , we &apos;ll have to careful look at that and stop calling these cultural inclusion programs .
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
mr. iqaqrialu
mr. iqaqrialu : ( interpretation ) :
thank you chairperson .
i don &apos;t have too much left to say , but i &apos;m very happy that we &apos;ll be working together to get the university in my community .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. alakannuark
mr. alakannuark : ( interpretation ) :
thank you chairperson .
then they have to go away to go to school to take advantage of higher education and they can no longer use the educational facilities in the community even there still going to school .
i think we all know , i know how hard it is when you have child is going who has to be outside a community to get higher education .
i know that it &apos;s very difficult to keep that student in school and i have experience it myself .
it &apos;s difficult because that child is mine and that child is home sick , it &apos;s hard to see .
some communities still don &apos;t have a grade 12 , my question is what are you doing or what can be done to have all the communities grade 12 available in their schools .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
mr. arvaluk
hon. james arvaluk : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
mr. alakannuark
mr. alakannuark : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
the parents can be charged if they don &apos;t send their child to the school , i didn &apos;t know about that before , so i got very scared when i found out .
if your child under the age of 16 doesn &apos;t go to school the parent can be charged .
i &apos;ve been hearing this for sometime and i think that was in the legislation .
now are you going to be reviewing that legislation .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
mr. arvaluk
hon. james arvaluk : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i think that once that is decided by the legislation will have to obey it .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
mr. alakannuark
mr. alakannuark : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
those are the only questions i have .
thank you very much for answering my questions
chairperson :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairperson .
mr. chairperson let &apos;s begin with a bunch of general questions in reply to the ministers &apos; opening address .
i honestly and truly believe over the last number of years the entire education system in north has been a victim of cutbacks .
a really question the fact the system that we have right now , i think there needs to be a fundamental change in the way we deal with it .
i understand that i know from when i was in school there was program funded so students had an opportunity not only to participate in the academic not all people are academics .
the teachers out there are doing very best with what they &apos;ve been given to work with , what they haven &apos;t given the resources they need to do the job properly .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. arvaluk
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairperson .
there are some very good comments i will be demanding true reflection of the past experiences with the educational system .
the previous cut backs that resulted over crowding in the schools as a result that the students can &apos;t do as will as they should have .
big increases in dollars to improve them rather try to find most efficient way of making those programs and projects and services work better .
that part too will be looked at the same time so i will need available mla to work with me .
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairperson .
mr. chairperson i think i &apos;ll leave those as general , when we get into the specific of the budget ask some more question at that time .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
iqaqrialu did you wanted make another comments , no .
thank you any other comments mr. irqittuq
mr. irqittuq :
( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
at least i &apos;m very pleased today that i &apos;m able to sit here with you .
my parents or my grandparents had made a mistake , it hurts me in my heart because of the fact that i wanted to get formal education .
listening to the campaign through the media , all the members now during their campaign used education as their platform and education has always been a priority .
in the smaller communities although we are very pleased , that we are utilizing our mother tongue in the smaller communities .
i realize that i did not train my children on that aspect .
many people in that age , our age we have been taught by our parents how to sew and how to hunt .
the students who are of age to learn the traditional skills still don &apos;t know how to survive .
we are losing that knowledge in our communities , so before we lose all of our culture , mr. chairman , i would like to see them revived and being instructed .
i know that your department will work hard towards that goal .
those are the issues that i would like to raise and those are the issues that i have used as a platform during my campaign .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
as the member stated my son is in grade 11 , my child , since he was going to school he doesn &apos;t seem to be using the inuktitut language in the community .
it might be true but they don &apos;t take language arts in the classrooms but usually the language arts are taught by the parents .
the only time they are taught english is how to read and write .
if a student doesn &apos;t utilize his language at home the level of learning is not going to be as good .
all of us have learned how to speak english when we went to school .
once we started reading government documents or books in the library .
once this is taught in school , the first language must be taught by the parents and once you are taught you can get good at speaking in that language .
also it is a fact that some students will have to get further entry levels such as learning basic math and english because the community high school learning program was vocational training .
the local education authorities don &apos;t usually prepare the students to go to university and if the local education authority tries to they can prepare their students at an entry level .
i think some of them should be taught at home .
i think we have to say to all nunavut residents that we have to take on that responsibility if we want to train our children .
i suggest the way to do this is to go out hunting , build a kamotik and build an igloo .
i have that responsibility to teach my child .
for that reason i could buy my son hockey equipment for 500 dollars because he wants to go out hunting or if a student wants to go swimming you buy them bathing suits .
so there are many issues that the school doesn &apos;t teach .
social skills ;
as a father , i should hold that responsibility to teach my child .
i think we have to publicize the fact that the parents have to take on that responsibility too because the students are in school from 9 - 5 with different subjects .
we have to take on this responsibility as parent to teach our children social skills .
it is not segregated , the children tend to follow their parents life style .
so we have to take that and we have to keep on elaborating that to our children .
thank you mr. chairman ..
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. irqittuq do you want to make any other comments .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i agree with you and in some ways i don &apos;t .
i believe what he is saying that we get to learn about life after the schools .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. irqittuq your time is up .
you need unanimous consent to continue .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i would like to get unanimous consent to continue my comments .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. irqittuq is looking for unanimous consent to continue his comments .
some members :
agreed .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
ok .
you may go ahead mr. iqaqrialu .
i can &apos;t speak any english but at least i can say &quot; ok &quot; .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
what i was trying to say is that his response is a fact and it is entirely true .
even after being in school we learn new things daily .
the reason i wanted to see that is because the students stay in school for a long period during the day .
for example , i have a grandchild and her mom , the mother of my grade 12 is still in school .
if she has to write in english , she can &apos;t write properly and she still can &apos;t speak proper english .
usually we send our students to school at the age of 5 . for fifteen years they go to school and they are still in school .
i feel that this has to be improved because i know that they are very articulate , i am talking about my home community .
there is a problem somewhere in the education system .
i am not saying that all the communities in nunavut should have a good education system but i want to have a good education system in my home community .
i am glad that you stated the local education authorities will have more authority .
i have seen all of these things and think that we have to rectify them .
that &apos;s why i have mentioned what i stated to the minister .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
mr. minister would you like to respond .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
no .
but i just want to say that we have given the local education authority the authority to deal with what you have stated .
we usually have various reasons why the students don &apos;t go to school , like mr. anawak had stated for housing .
housing also has an impact on a student &apos;s education due to overcrowding . it has an impact on the students .
we have to deal with this as a whole , we have to deal with this as a whole because one little reason is not enough .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. minister .
mr. irqittuq do you want to comment further .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
possibly after the other members make comments .
chairperson :
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
just a few brief questions for the minister and some comments .
i know that may seem harsh and i am not saying that it is the norm , but i know for a fact that it does exist .
my question to the minister , before we can deal with the problem we have to identify it and see what level it is at or how severe it is .
is there any testing that takes place now that students in grade 3 to 9 that tests them for their reading level to see what level they are at .
it may say that they are in grade 8 but are they only reading at grade 4 or 3 .
is there such testing being done now across the board .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
i would like to have ian rose answer that .
chairperson :
mr. rose .
mr. rose :
thank you .
if i understand the question correctly the standardized testing across , so that all students in all grades in all communities receive the same test .
that is occurring only at the ages of 13 and 16 in some subject areas at this point .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
in the example i gave it was a student in grade 9 that was only reading at grade 4 or 3 .
are you testing now any of these students to see what actual level they are at .
not their grade level but their actual reading level .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
but mr. chairman , actually i think with that question then we probably could get more information from the field , then give a more detailed response to the member if he wants .
chairperson :
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
that would be helpful , mr. chairman .
but i would ask the minister if he would commit to survey the severity of the problem .
it is difficult to deal with unless you know how big it is .
what grades , what levels and what ages and so on you are dealing with .
so i would think that would be the first step in dealing with the overall problem here .
the second point i want to talk about is social passing .
basically just moving students on because maybe you are just tired of them being in the classroom or whatever .
would you speak briefly to that and what your thoughts are and whether you think it should be changed and how you would address it .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
these are good questions .
i am going to answer the second one first .
i don &apos;t believe in social passing . i am dead against that .
i would like to honour the request by the member on the survey .
chairperson :
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman i can certainly wait for that information , i just think that it is something that the minister and his staff should be looking at .
it certainly doesn &apos;t do anybody any good to leave school and say that i have grade 10 or 11 and only have a grade 2 or 3 reading level .
i guess the other part of the problem is how do you correct it .
i guess that is why you are the minister so we will leave that up to you .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
yes , we have a literacy consultant now , alexis utatnaq and some other staff who can take specific assignments in specific communities , and for specific persons .
so the problem we have here is we have a population of students in our schools but they also have different problems of their own that touch on other departments responsibilities .
so it is fairly complicated .
chairperson :
thank you . mr. arvaluk .
mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. arvaluk has stated quite a number of times that he would like support from the members of the legislative assembly .
when are you going to be asking for this support from the members .
that is my question mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
i am sure the government will have a plan of what kind of legislation they would like to see and the preliminary plans will probably be given to the standing committees for consideration .
the department of education will probably give them their goals to the committees for review .
as i stated earlier we are still short on staff and we are not going to have thinks all set out and given to you .
we would like to work together with you on the educational issues and we will start our plans prior to the october sitting .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
: any further comments mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you for that clarification , mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. chairman .
i was actually relieved to hear the ministers &apos; statement on social passing .
are you aware of how much social passing is going on in the nunavut schools or is it just in certain regions .
is it nunavut wide ?
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
mr. chairman , i don &apos;t have a clue .
i think that is the only time we will be able to say what competence level our students have and what level they are at . what grade level they are at .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. arvaluk , please recognize the chairperson .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. chairman .
i am not aware of how much it is in nunavut , but i am aware of it in my own individual community .
it distresses me to follow statistics in the keewatin where we have an 85 % dropout rate .
so our kids have an 85 % chance of not finishing school .
i am aware of the departmentals that are being written in baker lake that are the alberta departmentals .
if they don &apos;t have solid skills and problem solving abilities , when the get into grade 9 , 10 , 11 , that &apos;s where our dropout rates start .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
i am sorry that i got a little bit excited .
we have to work with the parents .
somehow we have to find a way to have the parents involved , have them take charge of their own children .
i think we also have to consider the practice of educating the parents , if i may use that word , that the children don &apos;t get a second chance in education .
you cannot stop their age .
they are growing they &apos;ve got a birthday every year , if they miss that out then by the time they are adults they don &apos;t want to start from grade 1 again .
how do you guide them through that , the children are the same way they have to be guided in a way that they will be comfortable .
they are not awakened and fed in the morning , is that showing that they don &apos;t care .
no , not necessarily it is just that they are sleepy .
i think that we are going to have to work with the parents as to what the end result is going to be if we don &apos;t work together .
chairperson :
thank you .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
i would like to take a brief break , at least fifteen minutes .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. nutarak would like to take a break .
do you agree , okay we will take a break . no more than fifteen minutes .
&gt; &gt; committee recessed from 4.13 to 4.33 pm
chairperson ( interpretation ) :

would you like to go back to them .
agreed .
okay page 9 - 4 .

some members :
agreed .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , in here it talks about this areas being responsible for human resource development .
is that just in regards to the department staff itself or does it deal with human resources for example in the schools , the college and that .
i just wanted to know before i asked a question here , whether there would be a more appropriate place .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
just wait a moment while they are looking through their papers .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
mr. chairman . i would like to ask my deputy minister to answer that please .
chairperson :
mr. moody .
mr. moody :
thank you .
in answer to the specific question , all areas in the budget that relate to human resource planning , relate only to the department and not to the boards .
those responsibilities are at this time still vested with the boards for the 1999-2000 year the same as they were in previous years .
the other area where human resource planning show primarily is under corporate services , i &apos;ll just try to get you a tab number there .

over the next year what we are looking at is to take on studies in five areas .
one of them is the language instruction research , labour force market needs analysis , curriculum development plan , school funding review and a nunavut arctic college funding review .
those are the five major areas that we are looking at in conducting some research and studies .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i &apos;ve got language of instruction , labour force review , curriculum planning and i missed the last one .
i wonder if i could just ask him to repeat that please .
chairperson :
mr. rose .
mr. rose :
the last two were a school funding review and an nunavut arctic college funding review and one other that i didn &apos;t mention a long term capital planning review .
so there will be six .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman there are some areas here that i see in these studies , when you look at the labour force review and the nunavut arctic college funding .
are those the kinds of things that go hand in hand .
i am just wondering if they are going to incorporate those types of things into their labour force review .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
yes , mr. chairman , we have to look at what in the labour force market for work in nunavut . not just in the mining industry but also the shrimp fisheries by
qikiqtaaluk corporation and there are potential jobs for people in nunavut not necessarily tied to the government of nunavut .
so we will include all of that .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo . mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman i would like to ask the minister in here it says language of instruction and curriculum planning .
just to point out a fact that over the past two years here at the high school , they &apos;ve posted an inuktitut position and have got absolutely no response to those positions .
i am wondering if in light of this if the minister could maybe provide a brief outline of the types of things that will be looked at in the language of instruction and curriculum
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
we are making plans now as to how we can get more training programs for language specialists .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , maybe just to help speed up the process a little bit .
so that if we are members of the legislative assembly would like to have any input or suggestions , to assist the department , we would then be given the opportunity to do so .
could i just look for a commitment for that in the future .
and that would clear up any questions in this area .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
yes we can do that and we will co-operate with the member , and especially with the standing committee on education and have their involvement with that .

mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
i am sorry mr. chairman , this salaries and wages , 536 thousand amount .
perhaps could you elaborate on this further .
is it for all the employees wages plus benefits .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
financial services would have five in iqaluit .
human resource development would have 2 in iqaluit and information technology would have 2 in iqaluit .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
under this salaries and wages , it is not including all of the employees or is it just some of the employees .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
it is including just some of the employees .
chairperson :
thank you .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
what about the rest of the salaries that are excluded in this .
are these separately reported .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
okay this is under policy and planning and these are separately budgeted for because all of the policy and planning , corporate services and adult education and schools all of those are separated .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , historically corporate services has been the department that looks after the other services within other divisions within the department .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
yes , mr. chairman , inevitably this will be the job of the implementation co-ordinator to identify with the divisional boards what areas would be effected by that .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i would like to just ask the minister and his staff .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
the regional office personnel will still be there to help the dea &apos;s in whatever areas they need help .
what we are saying is that some of these positions in corporate services may not be required in the regional office .
we will have to identify first which positions will be moved to other departments of the government .
but , for services that are required by the dea &apos;s there will still be , i am pretty sure that the implementation co-ordinator will recognize those as essential services to those dea &apos;s .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
also mr. chairman , i would like to ask the minister if , we &apos;ll use iqaluit as an example , there are four schools here in iqaluit now .
the dea has or will have a huge responsibility to look after all four schools .
will there be provisions for them to be able to , if they need to , hire staff to assist them in their day to day operations .
the minister can correct me if i am wrong , but i understand that all of these boards right now are on an volunteer basis .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
mr. chairman , we will have these options put forward , because i for one , don &apos;t want to pre-judge the implementation co-ordinators &apos; recommendations .
what recommendations he will make to that effect i don &apos;t know .
thank you .

mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
this 21 million 471 thousand .
what is that for , really .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
this department will have 14 positions , 13 of which will be located in arviat and one in iqaluit .
the mission of the division is to provide life long learning experiences within the inuit qaujimajatuqangit framework that promotes the active participation in the family , the community and the workplace .
this mission will be accomplished through the focus areas of nunavut arctic college .
apprenticeship trades education , literacy programming , and career development , and student financial assistance .
we do provide student financial support for the students .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
what about 9 - 11 , 13 million 558 .
what is that going to be used for .
it states the college contribution .
so i would like you to elaborate further on that .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
it is going to be a bit lengthy .
in support of arctic college provides for operations &amp; maintenance costs at the community level in the three regions , baffin , kivalliq and keewatin .
in rankin inlet , community administration , adult basic education .
in cambridge bay drug and alcohol and adult basic education .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , this is where the college is given all of its &apos; funding .
as most of us are aware , this funds all of their core programs , i am wondering mr. chairman if the minister is looking at the need in the communities in nunavut .
is that something that the department is looking at ensuring that we have core funding for programs other than the existing programs over there .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
yes .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i know that a number of students not only from iqaluit but from all over nunavut , were here taking the pre-nursing course .
as i went around during the campaign and talked to people at the college they were anticipating and hoping that this program would start up again in the fall .
mr. chairman , i would like to clarify that the minister is stating that there will not be funding for the nursing program here at arctic college this fall .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
not in this main estimates , but i haven &apos;t given up yet .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman has the department taken a look at the existing programs that are offered through the college .
as in anything when you train people for a length of time then the need out there changes .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
yes , in fact as we speak we are reviewing those possibilities with the nunavut arctic college .
hopefully within the month we would be able to answer the member .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i also would like to get clarification in regards to the nursing program .
perhaps with the minister for health and social services , i forgot what we were dealing with on the main estimates .
i don &apos;t remember if the main estimates for health and social services budget included the nursing training course .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
no the department has not planned yet .
it is not included in the main estimates .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
going on to the main estimates .
total operations &amp; maintenance 21 million 471 thousand .
do you agree .
some members :
agreed .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
capital .
total capital nil .
total expenditures , 21 million 471 thousand .
some members :
agreed .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
just a quick comment here or question .
i know that in the previous capital plan there were some dollars allocated for additional student residences here in iqaluit .
mr. chairman i would like to ask the minister , i see that they are not on this capital plan , i wonder if they are on the b list .
are they still on the plans for additional student residences here in iqaluit .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
so they have been deferred to next years &apos; capital budgets .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
going back to the main estimates again .
total expenditures , do you agree .
some members :
agreed .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
total 21 million 471 thousand .
some members :
agreed .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i am going on to the next page .
early childhood education and school services .
total operations &amp; maintenance 81 million 164 thousand .
some members :
agreed .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , this is the area that determines all of the staffing in the school systems if i am correct in assuming that .
so if they had four students that required someone with them all day they would only get two people to help deal with them .
now if they are all in different classes or something like that i can see that it creates problems within the school .
so i would like to know if this is something that the department is taking a look at and if not now when would they be looking at addressing it .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
we are using the status quo this year because we came in as a government on april 1 and the budget allocations were already there basically .
but for next year we will be reviewing all of the formulas that are used in this and pertaining to the question of mr. tootoo .
so yes we will be looking at those as part of the review .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo , i am sorry mr. tootoo , i was on the wrong channel , if you could summarize your questions because the clock is ticking .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
mr. chairman . as was indicated earlier i talked to the minister about bussing .
this is the area to where there is a need for bussing and especially a great need here in iqaluit .
mr. chairman i would like to ask the minister if he is willing to commit to providing the necessary bussing requirements that will be required here in iqaluit in the fall .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
mr. chairman , this is a fairly complicated formula , that i would also like to review .
but for the meantime i would like to have ian rose answer that .
chairperson :
mr. rose .
mr. rose :
the funding formula for schools which makes up a large chunk of their formula are in the amounts in here .
the formula is an allocation formula and it may be high and it may be low in some areas .
there are a number of different variables used to calculate the money that goes to the dec &apos;s .
then the dec &apos;s are free to move that money around and they move it based upon their enrolments , based upon other factors .
then that money can be used and moved around within each dec .
they then move that money out to the dea &apos;s at the local community level .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , mr. rose indicated that the regional education councils , i guess they are calling them now , have the authority to allocate those resources .
the only way that they could do it is by taking money from other communities that need it or cutting programs .
i don &apos;t think that would be acceptable .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
either one of you is going to respond .
which one ?
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
i hear no question .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
yes , we will commit to doing that with the divisional boards and the dec to avoid taking some money from other communities that also need it .
we &apos;ll look at that .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
back to the main estimates .
mr. tootoo , please make it brief .
mr. tootoo :
i will do my best mr. chairman .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
okay then we will go on to the total operations &amp; maintenance 81 million 164 thousand .
do you agree .
some members :
agreed .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
going on to the next page 9 - 9 .
it is just an information item for the three regions .
baffin total 4 million 297 thousand .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
mr. chairman , i think you forgot to do the capital expenditures and we skipped it .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
the capital expenditures we go to the next page and then we go back to the capital after .
for baffin total 4 million 297 thousand .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , here we have renovations to the middle school in iqaluit .
i am wondering if that is putting on any additional classrooms to the existing school that is there .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
no .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i am under the understanding that when the plans were done up for the middle school initially it was to be 20 classrooms and they only got ten .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
back to the main estimates .
baffin total 4 million 297 thousand .
some members :
agreed .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
kitikmeot . total 2 million 174 thousand .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. chairman .
for the capital expenditures it looks like the keewatin got left right off the map this year .
i am sure that was an oversight by the department .
regarding the baker lake jonah amitnak school there was 319 thousand dollars in the capital plan for 99 / 00 for the planning .
that has been dropped and like i indicated earlier in the week that is the oldest surviving school in nunavut , and the nwt .
i am wondering if the minister would consider looking at putting that money back in the budget for the design of that school next year .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
i can &apos;t commit for this year because the capital projects are not slated for this year .
it has to come from the government , not from my department .
that &apos;s all we &apos;re doing .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
going back to the main estimates .
kitikmeot total 2 million 174 thousand .
total capital with kitikmeot and baffin , total capital 6 million 671 .
going backwards , to 9 - 8 , total capital 6 million 471 thousand .
some members :
agreed .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
total expenditures , 87 million 635 thousand .
some members :
agreed .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
going back to 9 - 10 .
income support , operations &amp; maintenance total 26 million 157 thousand .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
yes , mr. chairman , the recommendation to move the income support program to sustainable development , is still the plan .
at the moment we are handling the delivery part of the income support .
this huge program and service will require both of our departments to be spending a lot of time together on how to best make a recommendation to the government to proceed with that .
the minister and i recognized that .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
yes that was our first discussion our first concern .
not only if there is disruption , but miscommunication could create chaos , with the clients .
also there was a concern that present delivery mechanism , using computers from the gnwt are not y2k compatible so we are now , in a project in pangnirtung .
i think it was iqaluit and ottawa .
the system i think that has been since corrected .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
at this time i have two names on my list .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
this 26 million 157 thousand for operations &amp; maintenance , if we look at 9 - 11 , if you look at the adult basic education it is only slotted for 90 thousand .
it &apos;s quite small looking at that figure when you are talking about adult basic education and literacy .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
i am not quite sure , his comment had nothing to do with income support , under 9 - 10 .
i don &apos;t believe his comments had anything to do with the discussion at hand .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
maybe i could ask this question . does the income support include the details of grants and contributions under 9 - 11 , and 9 - 12 .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu if you go to 9 - 14 , that is what you are talking about , you are talking about the details of grants and contributions .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
no .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
on page 9 - 10 , it states here that grants and contributions are 25 million 724 .
under grants and contributions at 25 million 724 , mr. minister i would like clarification on what can go under grants and contributions .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
yes , the breakdown for that is 24 million 288 thousand income support program provides payments to individuals based on family size and previous months income .
approximately 13000 people about 55 % of the population of nunavut , are receiving that and 705 thousand contract for services provided by various hamlets across nunavut for provision of services .
the last one 731 thousand , for senior supplementary benefits , are payments to seniors . approximately 480 people at 135 dollars per month .
chairperson :
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman for the response , i was wondering if the handicapped or special services went under grants and contributions .
disabled persons and handicapped , deaf or mute , i thought that this grants and contributions was slotted for disabled and handicapped person , mr. chairman , thank you .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i think that grants and contribution might be the wrong term to use .
what it really means is for income support for needy families and it totals up to 25 million 724 which covers the whole nunavut area .
therefore monthly payments for the needy families on a monthly basis , and unemployed and elders and so on and covers the whole nunavut .
chairperson :
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you for that information .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
since i have no more on my list . total expenditures 26 million 157 thousand .
no capital .
total expenditures 26 million 157 thousand .
some members :
agreed .
chairperson ( interpretation ) : 9 - 11 , details of grants and contributions .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i would like to go back to the question that i asked earlier regarding the adult basic education / literacy slated for 90 thousand .
if we are looking at the whole nunavut area , and we are talking about adults , it looks like it is way too small .
i think that we have to look at it further in our budget if there is no other programs that are going to be made available for adult basic education and literacy .
i would like further clarification on this point .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
mr. chairman , i will have ian respond .
chairperson :
mr. rose .
mr. rose :
thank you .
there are several places where funding for adults could come in , this particular item , adult basic education and literacy supports community literacy projects run by local groups .
for example , family literacy in various places , or special projects in various communities . students who are enrolled in adult basic education programs at community adult ed .
centres , that is a program that is funded by the college and would be funded by the college contributions .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
we will then go back to 9 - 11 , that was for information only .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
sorry i thought we were looking at all grants and contributions , are we going to be getting to 9 - 12 next and i could ask the question then .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
yes we are just about on 9 - 12 and we will not move ahead unless it is agreed upon .
some members :
agreed .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
okay then agreed . 9 - 12 is details of grants and contributions .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman i see the two areas on this page of grants and contributions totalling almost 6 and a half million dollars to deal with curriculum development .
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
this aboriginal language and culture program , each dec receives funding to support the regional teaching and learning centre and also produces inuktitut and inuinnaqtun , materials in their original dialects .
i don &apos;t have the breakdown details right now but i will provide it later , if you want mr. chairman . chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i just note there that it says that it is to be used to provide language and cultural development right through to grade 12 .
i am just wondering mr. chairman if in that is in fact the case where those services are being provided in high schools , thank you . chairperson :
mr. arvaluk . hon. james arvaluk :
mr. chairman for that detail i will ask ian rose to answer that . chairperson :
mr. rose . mr. rose :
thank you mr. chairman .
the money would be used through the teaching and learning centres through the dec &apos;s .
they would choose and decide which projects they would want to support and move forward on .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman i would just like to ask on the instructional and support services , this is a large sum of money and i don &apos;t understand what that is for .
so maybe i could just get a brief explanation as to what those dollars are used for .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. rose .
mr. rose :
that money would be used to support the review , monitoring and creation of curriculum to be used in the k - 12 systems .
also the support of selected program reviews that would monitor and go in and do an evaluation of curriculum &apos;s and projects at the school levels , thank you .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. rose .
mr. rose :
my understanding would be that it is for use by the dec &apos;s .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , we have all heard this afternoon concerns over the school system .
if this assessment has been going on i am wondering if the department has a summary of what some of these assessments of the curriculum programs in the schools have been over the past .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. rose .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
those information would be available , or would be made available through the boards .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
is that it .
mr. tootoo . mr. tootoo :

mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk : i will ask mr. moody to answer that one , monitoring .
chairperson :
mr. moody .
mr. moody :
thank you mr. chairman .

thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :

agreed .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
it looks quite small .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu must have a lot of money because he says that 300 thousand dollars is too small .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
these employment program is mostly for studies related to employment planning , language of instruction , long term capital planning , labour market needs analysis and funding for disabled peoples for 18k .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
when you are looking at the whole nunavut area , 300 thousand dollars is quite small .
when we are talking about different aspects of education i have been doing that sort of stuff for a long time and it is very , very hard to access funds from the government .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
it is just the name that doesn &apos;t fit with what is in it .
it is not for employment it is more for studies and study programs and review .
it is more for studies than for employment .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you for that clarification .
but i think that we should be careful when we use terms for disabled persons , i would suggest that we find an inuktitut terminology that describes disabled person , without putting anybody down .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
just a comment . mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
this 300 thousand dollars that mr. iqaqrialu thinks is too small , 9 - 9 , so i would suggest that we move it to the clyde river total .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :

some members :
agreed .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :

chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
do they not belong to the nunavut government now , these dpw and all those departments are they not a part of the nunavut government now .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
mr. chairman , no maybe we should just take out gnwt altogether and just call it contracted services , nunavut services .
chairperson :
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
do you agree that mr. mclean can go back to a previous page .
agreed , go ahead mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you i will make it quick mr. chairman .
we were always looking for funding for day cares but we didn &apos;t realize that the education department have it .
could i have that information .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
yes it is to support community day care programs , we support them in the communities of cambridge bay , iqaluit .
financial support for operations and programs .
many day cares find support from other sources , user fees , to maintain service levels like those for communities .
i will provide the member , as soon as my adm comes back from gjoa haven tomorrow i guess , she will start working on it .
i will provide that .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i would like to thank mr. mclean for going back and pointing that out .
mr. chairman earlier on i asked about day care funding and the assistant deputy minister indicated that the department administers this as a federal program .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
mr. chairman , i lost my main man who will be going to gjoa haven , who would answer that level of detail question .
if you will bear with me for five seconds i wonder if i could find somebody else .
mr. chairman , can i invite glenn in the corner here so that he could answer on behalf of carmen levi .
some members :
agreed .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
you have agreement .
you may go ahead and sit at the witness table .
mr. sargent , you may go ahead .
mr. sargent :
thank you . mr. chairman , honourable members .
with respect to the day cares , as was just explained that was just funding to subsidize the operation .
these are monies that we are not getting from the federal government any more but money from within the department to support this activity .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i think that all the members will agree with me that the availability of day care spaces .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
so all this has to be looked at .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i just want to ask a final question and is the minister staff indicated that this program was ending this year .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
we should like to have them continued but this is a federal program .
then ... but we believe that they should continue also .
i think that &apos;s why it will be important for us to revisit that and see what other ways can this program be continued or be reactivated .
maybe there is room to have discussion with the federal counterparts in this area .
you know , i mean , we have to talk about that .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman i guess this i &apos;m glad this came up because it really concerns me .
if this funding is not there i &apos;m pretty sure that these daycares will not be able to operate .
i urge the minister to ensure that there is funding for them in the future and also i &apos;d like to ask him if the departments the daycares have been informed .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
mr. chairman i &apos;d like to make a quick correction here before it goes too far .
the one million , four hundred , sixteen thousand in the details of grants and contributions for the early childhood program is a nunavut government .
it &apos;s department money .
that should continue unless if you take it off .
agreed .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
once we finish the nine point thirteen we will take a 10 minutes break because i &apos;m tired of sitting down .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i going to make a brief question .
it says gnwt .
we will have to take the gnwt off and put in nunavut instead .
thank you .
agreed .
chairperson ( interpretation ) : nine point three , it &apos;s just an information .

mr. iqaqrialu would you come up and take the chairperson .

promoting inuit culture
mr. iqaqrialu :
thank you mr. speaker .
i would like to tell you a little story .
in the past our ancestors who lived to thrive and sustain their lives .
they were very hard working people .
even though at times they would go through periods without food .
around 1960s our inuit culture and tradition was changing .
as of today now we are taking back our culture and tradition .
we are now promoting and developing our own culture .
i would like to state that i am very proud of that and i really appreciate that .
thank you mr. speaker .

mr. irqittuq .
members &apos; statement 90 - 1 ( 2 ) :
proud of inuit ministers
mr. irqittuq :
thank you mr. speaker .
i would like to tell you a story as well .
when i was a small child i was told that there was a rcmp officer coming into the community .
i was very scared and intimidated .
i wanted to stay home and not go out .
we were living in a qarmaq ( sodhouse ) and they had their own houses .
it was all very foreign to us .
i thought that i was going to be picked up and incarcerated by the rcmp .
some of those ministers across the communities are all inuit today .
even the finance minister who is not an inuk looks like one .
i am so proud to have ministers who are all inuk .
i would just like to say that i am very proud of that .
speaker :
thank you mr. irqittuq .

oral questions
question 178 - 1 ( 2 ) :
status of question on gravel issue in hall beach
mr. irqittuq :
thank you mr. chairman .
i asked questions yesterday . my question is directed to mr. anawak .
i asked you about the gravel issue .
have you looked into that ?
speaker :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
minister anawak , minister of transportation .
hon. jack anawak :
the contractors who are working on the gravel have an agreement with the department of transportation .
they have to grind the gravel .
they are going to be using the garage while working on the gravel .
apparently they were working with the department of transportation .
we are still looking into how this agreement came about .
we will look at how the contract was agreed upon in hall beach .
at this time i do not want to have a debate over this issue with the community at this time .
i believe it is a private contractor and i understand what the issue is and what they have done to date .
i still have to find out which individuals made the agreement with the organization .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
oral questions mr. irqittuq .
question 179 - 1 ( 2 ) :
journeyman training facility for nunavut
mr. irqittuq :
thank you mr. speaker .
i do not want to take up all the time but i did campaign to represent my communities .
my question to the minister of education is that there are apprentice programs for heating and electrical journey man .
have you thought about getting a facility here in nunavut to do the training programs within nunavut .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
we do not have a facility as of yet .
we have not decided which community this program will be held in .
we used to have a program in iqaluit in the past .
however , as i mentioned yesterday we are in the planing process of where we are going to put the programs .
we are also in the transformation process from the gnwt to nunavut on issues like training for apprentice programs .
i would like to work with the ordinary mla &apos;s on these issues and i can not decide myself where i want to put these programs .
i would also like to consult with the members on where we should put these programs .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
oral questions mr. iqaqrialu
question 180 - 1 ( 2 ) :
sealift earlier in the season
mr. iqaqrialu :
thank you mr. speaker .
this is for the minister of transportation .
the ships come in really late during the fall when they are transporting construction materials to the communities .
it is almost too late by the time it starts getting cold in the communities . it is almost too late for construction .
i was wondering if they could do something about transporting materials a little earlier in the summer .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
transportation minister , mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak :
thank you .
usually when you are setting up the time lines for the shipping materials they usually do it late in the spring .
there are different companies who are interested in transporting materials .
we have more businesses owned by northerners who are getting into shipping materials .
we can consult with them and work on how we can improve the time line for shipping .
i am sure the mla &apos;s are aware that we did not have much say on how we wanted our materials shipped in the past .
these are some of the problems that we have encountered before .
we will hopefully have more say in the future on how the shipping is done .
thank you mr. chairman .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .

mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :

speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister of sustainable development , mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
as i have stated earlier we are now accumulating information as to where there has been exploration done .
we will review all the information we have on where the exploration has taken place .
we are encouraging interested parties to assist in the review of the issue because we can save a lot more money by reviewing all the past experiences .

speaker :
thank you .
please rephrase your question mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i am not asking for information that is not available to the public or has not been publicized , but there may be information that is available to this house .
for example , in the baker lake area outside of rankin , if the minister could give us some ideas as to where things stand to date with these operations .

question 182 - 1 ( 2 ) :
inmate concerns in nunatsiaq news
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i would like to direct this question to the minister of justice .
on friday i saw in the nunatsiaq news a concern from inmate .
i read the letter from the inmates , and it was addressed to the premier .
the concerns that were contained in the letter , how are you going to deal with these concerns .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
yes , we received a copy of the letter prior to it being published in the nunatsiaq news .
our department received a copy of the letter .
it is evident that we have to amend the correctional policies because the letter stated quite a few concerns .
i know that we will look into the issues that were raised in the nunatsiaq news .

speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kattuk .
acting premier , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i am not sure if there are federal subsidies except those through canada post for food mail .

i will try to provide more information on the whole breadth of government subsidies .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
oral question , mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :

speaker :
thank you mr. kattuk .
acting premier , mr. ng .

question 185 - 1 ( 2 ) :
whales trapped near grise fiord
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
this is directed to the minister of sustainable development .
i heard on the cbc radio this morning that there are whales trapped near grise fiord .
i wonder what the minister is doing about that .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister of sustainable development , mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i would like to first clarify that the whales are the responsibility of the department of fisheries and oceans .
i was not originally aware of the issue raised by the member but the day before yesterday i authorize funds to be used for our wildlife officers to assist dfo .
so according to yesterday &apos;s information the whales have been rescued already .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. kilabuk .
oral questions .
mr. o &apos;brien .
question 186 - 1 ( 2 ) :
cost of food
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i will direct my question to the acting premier , i am not sure if he is the minister responsible for the area i want to address .
mr. speaker , recently some of us have read in the paper , in this community for example , they talk about the price of food .
mr. speaker , i am not quite sure whether we have , will have , or could have any price controls in nunavut .
that mr. speaker , would be equal to about 22 dollars for a dozen corn on the cob when you would pay 2 dollars in alberta for a dozen .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
acting premier mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , it is an issue that we are aware of as a government .
we , quite frankly , haven &apos;t looked at any of those possibilities along those lines .
there has been some discussion at the very preliminary stage right now about the possibility of rent controls but it wouldn &apos;t have to do with consumer products .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
oral questions .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. speaker .
i guess that answer goes hand in hand with the issue that i am trying to address here . it is accommodations and food .
mr. speaker , this problem has gone on for many , many years and at some point in time we have to address it .
would the minister commit to following up on this to see if there is anything we could do to try to make sure that the cost of food is within reason .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
acting premier mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
so i can say that we will take a look at it and see if there are any measures that we might be able to put into place .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
oral questions .
mr. mclean .
question 187 - 1 ( 2 ) :
cost of living adjustments for social assistance
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question is to the minister of health &amp; social services but he is not here so i will direct it to the acting premier .
in regards to the cost of living in nunavut . we have all heard in the past year that navcanada rates have increased .
that directly effects all of us in nunavut .
people working can deal with this but there are the people on social assistance .
is there any mechanism that if the price of groceries goes up in nunavut , the social assistance cheques go up at the same time .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
acting premier , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
the survey of food identifies basic needs that are surveyed on a regular basis to see if those income support levels are meeting that basket of needs .
there are adjustments that are made from time to time to reflect the increased cost of living .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
oral questions , mr. o &apos;brien .
i am sorry mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. speaker .
i am pleased .

thank you mr. mclean .
acting premier , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. mclean , o &apos;brien ?
thank you mr. speaker .

speaker :
thank you mr. ng .

mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question is directed to the acting premier , or minister of finance .
i would like to ask the minister about a topic that was talked about this morning .

thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :

acting premier , mr. ng .

statement on the economy of nunavut
as a new territory in canada , we are at the very beginning of a new and challenging stage in &quot; our journey &quot; .
we know for example , that our people are asking questions about economic development in the new territory .
they have high expectations that this new government will make a difference .
there are questions from our partners in economic development .
in the past year , we have heard from the federal government , the government of the northwest territories , and from some of the inuit organizations , about an economic strategy for nunavut .
with the creation of this assembly , mr. chairman , there is now an opportunity to respond on behalf of all the people of nunavut .
mr. chairman , i also welcome the opportunity to answer those who question the very nature of our economy , who question , in fact , the self-reliance of our people .
mr. chairman , our economy is an exciting mix of new growth driven by markets we don &apos;t control , and our traditional way of life .
our connection to the land , which we call the traditional economy , is often overlooked by outside observers assessing nunavut &apos;s wealth and economic prospects .
yet this traditional economy is strong here in nunavut , mr. chairman .
when i speak about the development of the economy of nunavut , i am speaking in terms of sustainable development .
what does this mean ?
sustainable development also means development that includes all our people , that draws on all our talents , and on the collective wisdom we have inherited from our ancestors .
it is development that assures the greatest participation of our people , wherever they may live in nunavut .
healthy communities in nunavut .
our dynamic labour force
mr. chairman , in nunavut people come first .
we are all affected by economic activities in nunavut but , in today &apos;s world , we are perhaps most concerned about the economy when we reach working age .
during this government &apos;s term of office , it is projected that the number of people of working age in nunavut will increase by at least 13 % .
we often hear that our unemployment rate is at least 22 % across nunavut , and much higher than that , in some of our communities .
i want to state , here and now , mr. chairman , that as minister of sustainable development , i am committed to seeing this number reduced significantly over the term of this government .
there are several reasons why i am confident that we can achieve this goal .
mr. chairman , there are some very positive trends in nunavut that warrant mentioning .
we expect this trend to continue throughout the term of this government .
we all know that employment depends on achieving higher levels of education .
in the ten years between 1986 and 1996 the percentage of our adult population who left school before grade 9 has fallen from fifty-three to thirty-one per cent .
at the same time , the percentage of our adult population who graduated and obtained a post-secondary certificate , diploma , or degree , has almost doubled .
i do not want to force this committee to listen to a long list of statistics , mr. chairman .
and we all know that statistics can be misleading .
but it is important that we recognize that positive changes are taking place in our working age population , and that we expect these changes to continue , and to continue to improve .
we have in nunavut a young and dynamic labour force , a growing population of working age .
we must view this as one of the greatest resources we possess .
nunavut &apos;s &quot; mixed &quot; economy
i have said that in nunavut we have an economy that is unique in canada .
our economy is a dynamic mixture of the traditional economy , based on the production of food , clothing and craft , and new resource opportunities in tourism , the fishery , and minerals .
mr. chairman , government plays a large a role in our economy .
many of the employment opportunities available in nunavut are with government .
but today we , in this assembly , we are the government .
many have called for greater diversification of our economy .
i agree with them .
this process is already underway .
for those who question the range of activity in our economy i invite them to review the list of businesses in nunavut that is now available on the world-wide web .
there you will find ample evidence of the enterprising nature of our people .
here in nunavut we have
this situation is not unique to pangnirtung .
the listing of nunavut businesses to which i refer contains almost four hundred individual company names , in thirty-two categories of business activity .
in the past two years , more than one hundred and sixty businesses have registered as inuit-owned firms under article 24 of the nunavut land claim agreement .
nunavut &apos;s economy today , mr. chairman , is based on more than government jobs .
i do not want to suggest here , mr. chairman , that i am satisfied about the level of business development in nunavut .
i know that in many of our communities , business opportunities are limited , and economic development has been slow .
( interpretation ends ) :
the business incentive program is being maintained and reviewed .
the business credit corporation and the community futures program will continue to provide loans to viable business enterprises in nunavut .
my department will continue to support small business through grants and contributions for start-ups , development of existing businesses , and training .
i am particularly pleased to see that program partnerships are being formed between my department and inuit organizations , across nunavut .
i am encouraging staff at the department of sustainable development to expand this &quot; one window &quot; approach . we have seen its success at the &quot; kivalliq partners in development . &quot;
i hope to see this process extended throughout nunavut during the term of this government .
i am also encouraged to see the efforts made to more effectively monitor and report on the effectiveness of the programs of government and inuit organizations in our communities .
people want to know where government is spending public funds on economic development and other programs .
we must improve our communications to our people how to access our programs and how the money is spent over a year .
mr. chairman we also want to communicate to the rest of canada that nunavut has great resource potential .
as was pointed out by the minister of finance in the past year alone , it is estimated that more than $ 70 million was invested in nunavut by the mineral exploration industry .
this expenditure of private funds signals to all of us that the potential for mineral development in nunavut is very promising .
and it should also remind us that the source of our wealth is the land - as it has been for thousands of years , and as it will be for generations to come .
( interpretation ) :
our natural environment has always provided the foundation for our mixed economy , mr. chairman , as it will for the diversified economy of the future .
whether it is through the sale of minerals , furs , or fish , our incomes depend on the good health of our environment ... sorry .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
we can hear english and inuktitut at the same time .
can someone please fix it ... there we go .
mr. kilabuk .
whether it is through the sale of minerals , furs , or fish , our incomes depend on the good health of our environment .
as members know , i have a deep commitment to the development of a sustainable marine fishery in davis strait which inuit began fishing in 1986 .
in the last 13 years inuit have consistently been provided with small allocations , and have been shut out entirely from entering the competitive quota with the rest of canada .
it will be my intention during the term of this government to vigorously pursue more equitable allocation of the resources that lie off our shores .
we have demonstrated over the past several years that there are real benefits in further developing our fishery .
along with obtaining access to additional quota , we must urge the government of canada to invest in the research necessary to identify new fish resources .
the last 13 years have demonstrated that our communities can benefit greatly from the sustainable development of our fisheries resources , and my home community of pangnirtung is a good example of that .
i have spoken in this assembly recently about my department &apos;s sealskin fur strategy , and our work to expand markets for fur products .
these programs will continue .
i have also asked staff in the department of sustainable development to review the department &apos;s programs in support of harvesters .
we cannot ever forget , mr. chairman , the importance to our people of maintaining strong ties to the land .
this is our foundation for future economic development .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
were you planning to finish all at once ?
you still have a ways to go so lets break for lunch and you can complete your comments right after lunch at 1 : 30 pm
&gt; &gt; committee recessed for lunch at 12 : 00pm
&gt; &gt; committee resumed at 1 : 30 pm
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
please take your seats .
the minister was reading his opening remarks .
please continue .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson , i will start where i left off ...
toward a sustainable economy in nunavut
it is important for us to recognize that today in nunavut , the government is not alone in developing the economy .
there is the important role of our growing private sector .
mr. chairman , we all know the valuable contribution made to our economy by the people who have established their own small business .
there is also the contribution made by the co-operatives in our communities .
i was very pleased , earlier this month , to recognize this contribution publicly at the co-op agm in iqaluit .
the purpose of the forum was to serve as a vehicle for sharing information and ideas on our economy .
my department will continue to support the nunavut economic forum this year .
some economic development programs mr. chairman , are delivered most effectively when they are managed , not by government , but by the people themselves .
the transfer of economic development funds in the tourism sector , to nunavut tourism , is a good example .
nunavut tourism also has been successful attracting more funding from outside nunavut to our tourism industry .
my department is currently engaged in a similar process with arts &amp; crafts .
the modest funding provided the nunavut arts &amp; crafts association by my department has been used to attract more than double this amount from other sources for arts &amp; crafts programs in nunavut .
we also support community-based prospector &apos;s associations . again , this puts our people back into the role of developing their - in this case , by participating directly in the search for minerals .
we will work to improve education and training opportunities for them , many of whom were born and raised in the communities they now serve .
mr. chairman , there is a pattern to the support we are providing for economic development in nunavut today .
there are some major themes emerging that will influence the development of a strategy for economic development in nunavut in the future .
first among these is the participation of our people directly in the development of our economy .
what we want in nunavut , mr. chairman , is simply the chance to use our own talents and abilities and our knowledge - our culture - in the development of our community economies .
we want to participate in economic activities .
we want to contribute to the health and wealth of our communities .
we are , mr. chairman , a resourceful , productive , and self-reliant people .
we are here today , because our ancestors , through the generations , proved we have these qualities .
they worked hard , every day , to survive in this land .
they produced everything they needed for themselves , and they made sure that every family got its share .
because of them , we have the opportunity to build nunavut .
( interpretation ends ) : we must be self-reliant .
we must show what we can do with our talents and resources .
our families and our communities are no longer isolated , one from the other .
and we are no longer isolated in the world . we now are nunavut , part of the canadian federation , and part of one of the richest nations on earth .
as i said in a statement last week in this house , mr. chairman , we must educate people outside of nunavut about our way of life .
mr. chairman , we expect no more than to have the opportunity to show that we are productive , that we can share what we have , just as our ancestors did before us .
working together for nunavut
mr. chairman , i have outlined for this committee some of the important characteristics of our economy , and briefly discussed the themes that will influence our approach to economic development .
now i would like to be more specific , and address directly how we propose to begin to bring improvements to our economy .
a nunavut jobs corps
mr. chairman , the development of the opportunities in the economy that i have outlined to this point must involve the full participation of our people .
i have said , mr. chairman that our people are productive , and seek more opportunities to contribute to their communities .
we must remember how we all had to learn to be productive , and that this process takes time , and that it requires experience , and maturity .
we must find more ways to include young people in our work , to provide them with opportunities to help their communities .
in many cases , these opportunities are in education .
our young people make a valuable contribution to us all when they choose to stay in school .
but , for some , this choice is not possible .
they want to work in other ways .
these youth , too , must be included in the development of our economy .
they must have a role in building our future .
this is why , mr. chairman , i am proposing that this government seek the ways and means of creating a nunavut jobs corps .
the development of our economic opportunities will require a skilled work force and we must provide those opportunities to those who want to be part of our economy .
an mou with the government of canada
a second , major area in which we can take immediate action concerns our relationship with the government of canada .
( interpretation ends ) : several other partnerships with federal departments are in progress .
minister &apos;s forum on the economy
the first step has three parts : to meet , to hear all views , and to begin to plan .
we must try to answer the fundamental questions :
what is the work to be done in our communities ?
conclusion
mr. chairman , in standing before this legislature and the people of nunavut and i want to state how proud i am to make this statement on our economy .
i am proud because in preparing this statement i realized how much we as a people have to offer each other and the rest of the world .
our ancestors have worked very hard to ensure that our future would be secure .
in giving us a vision for nunavut they also gave us the responsibility to continue the vision and the responsibility to include all our people from innammariit to our nutarait .
mr. chairman , realizing our vision is building a sustainable economy .
it is educating people outside of nunavut on our way of life .
it is providing our youth with the skills to become productive members of our communities .
it is about encouraging our people to generate ideas and building on our strengths .
let us move forward with the next phase of building . thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kilabuk , minister of sustainable development .
your presentation was very good .
i will now ask mr. mclean , chairperson of the standing committee to read his report .
oh ... mr. minister did you have more to say ?
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
i wonder if i can continue with opening comments on sustainable development .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i thought you were finished .
go ahead .
opening comments for the 1999-2000 main estimates for the
department of sustainable development
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i am very pleased to have the opportunity to present to the committee of the whole , the budget recommended for the department of sustainable development in the 1999-2000 main estimates .
the department of sustainable development is a program department that touches the lives of people in our communities .
when we speak of having healthy , sustainable communities in nunavut , we speak of three aspects of life in our communities .
our environment , our economy , and our people .
the department of sustainable development is responsible for ensuring our resources are used wisely so that they can continue to be used for our future generations .
this is our mandate for the environment .
we are also responsible for providing the support needed for people to pursue livelihoods both in traditional and a wage economy .
this is our mandate for the economy .
we are responsible for providing the support needed for people to participate fully in decisions on development .
this is our mandate to our people .
mr. chairman , i think it is important to know that this mandate is different from , and more extensive than the mandate of our predecessor department in the gnwt .
the proposed budget for the department is 33.095 million , which represents approximately 5 % of the government of nunavut budget .
( interpretation ends )
the departments &apos; budget is organized in two main categories . corporate management .
which offers support functions to the department . 12 % of the total budget of sustainable development .
sustainable development which are the program functions of the department comprising 87 % of the budget .
it has a recommended budget of 4.099 million dollars for this year .
the sustainable development branch includes five divisions .
the income support division is co-managed with the department of education .
( interpretation ) mr. chairman , the department &apos;s budget for 1999-2000 includes 5.400 million for wildlife management , fisheries development and environmental protection .
in recent years there has been a declining investment by both the government of canada and the gnwt in spending on wildlife research .
( interpretation ends ) the department grants and contributions reach into our communities through four principal means .
first , partnerships .
on page 11 - 8 , and 11 - 9 , the department combines its &apos; funding with a number of outside agencies who share responsibility to the environment or the economy .
example , nunavut tourism and nunavut geoscience office .
two , sector development . page 11 - 10 .
the department provides financial support to individuals in communities and harvesters to support their plans in the traditional and wage economy .
these will be community initiatives , funds , grants to small business , business development fund , community harvesters &apos; assistance program .
number three , the department has budgeted 2.915 million for that purpose .
number 4 , grants , page 11 - 11 .
the department provides grants of up to 5 thousand for individuals establishing or maintaining a small business or who wish to carry out fishing or prospecting activities .
first in the arts and crafts we have budgeted 100k in support of the nunavut arts and crafts association .
secondly , we have budgeted 450 thousand dollars toward a partnership with the government of canada for the establishment of a nunavut geoscience office .
as members know the foundation of the mining industry is exploration .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
just a moment .
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i don &apos;t think we have a quorum .
i think it is less than half of the number needed to have a full meeting .
just to remind you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. akesuk .
we don &apos;t have a quorum at this time so we will take a few minutes break to ask the other members to return to the house . five minutes .
&gt; &gt; committee recessed at 2.02 pm .
&gt; &gt; committee resumed at 2.10 pm
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
we have a quorum now , we can start again .
when we are listening to the presentation , this is a very important issue , i urge the members not to leave the chamber .
i am urging you to stay in the chamber , mr. kilabuk you may continue .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
we still have to get used to the term , ikupiktulirijikkut .
i will just continue on from where i was .
page 5 , thirdly , under contract services we have set aside 50 thousand to pursue increased allocations to nunavut from offshore fisheries .
this is a subject of great concern to me and i am very committed to seeing that nunavut be given greater attention in the allocation of the fisheries resources that lie off our shores .
finally , and most importantly , mr. chairman , on the strength of a recently evaluation of nunavut tourism i have increased their core funding this year by 1643 thousand dollars .
nunavut tourism has committed to strengthening their communications with their members in the communities and with their work in developing new tourism products for nunavut .
i have provided for this in their 1999-2000 core funding . ( interpretation ends ) .
mr. chairman , as i have indicated it is my intention to vigorously pursue an agreement on an economic strategy with the government of canada .
i trust that i will be able to report in the days ahead , of traditional investment money being made available to support continued and sustainable growth in the nunavut economy .
one final note under grants and contributions is worthy of mention .
to this end i have set aside 30 thousand in scholarships for young people who wish to further their education in the science , commerce and the traditional economy .
the department currently has about 82 positions filled out of its &apos; total staff complement of 135 positions .
of those filled positions 33 or 40 % are held by inuit .
the department &apos;s current vacancy rate for staff is 40 % .
( interpretation ) mr. chairman , the budget of my department is relatively small .
our mandate however , effects everyone in nunavut and touches on issues that are of great concern to our people . the health of our land , our economy and our communities .
thank you .

mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .

he also indicated that the department has plans to distribute a one-page communications piece to all residents of nunavut .

i expected to see many more officials than one .
general comments , the floor is open for general comments and questions .
minister of sustainable development , can you introduce your officials .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
my deputy minister is kathryn trumper who will be sitting with me at the witness table .
i think she has been working a little bit over eighteen years within our department .
ed martin is our finance comptroller , sandy teiman , for income support policy analyst .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister of sustainable development .
the floor is open for general comments or questions .
are there any questions or comments .
please indicate if you have any questions .
if there are no further questions we will go onto the main estimates .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
when he did his opening remarks , that nunavut residents have been bypassing the department .
what does that mean , what did you mean when you said that at the beginning .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
minister of sustainable development , mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
perhaps i mistranslated it , if perhaps i could ask the member to identify where that comment is made in the presentation paper .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak :
when you were under mining , exploration , that you stated that there are entities already existing .
water board , impact review board , which the companies have to go through to get approval , so i was wondering if that was in line with that .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
minister of sustainable development , or your official can respond .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
yes , i found it on page four .
what i was trying to say is that our economy is dependent on the land and we should be using the traditional economy .
we have not been using the traditional economy up to our potential in the communities .
we have to find traditional ways to enhance the economy in the communities because other people outside of nunavut have overlooked the traditional economy .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
how are we going to deal with the outsiders overlooking nunavut &apos;s wealth and economic prospects .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
minister of sustainable development .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
perhaps when the researchers come in they overlook the traditional economy .
i don &apos;t know how many times we have met with officials , we have reiterated about the traditional economy , each time we meet with these officials .
this is part of the nunavut economy so it has been overlooked by outsiders so we would like to include this in our overall economy .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister of sustainable development .
the members may identify if they have any questions or comments so i can put your names down on the list .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i have a few questions in regards to the ministers &apos; opening statements .
that &apos;s what i was doing when i wasn &apos;t here i was trying to review it in a little more detail .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of sustainable development , if you wish to respond .
hon. peter kilabuk :
... ( inaudible ) ...
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
hold on , your microphone is not on .
go ahead .
i am sorry that i had to stop you but one of the members couldn &apos;t hear the translation .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
i can only say it is between 20 and 40 million , the money that is being made from northerners that would traditionally have been in the north .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. tootoo .
did you have another question .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of sustainable development , did you have a comment .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i would like to make a clarification about what i had said about this survey .
it has been ongoing for two years and it is going to continue for another five years .
we are just trying to find out now how beneficial this is for the northerners .
we won &apos;t know until we have some statistics , what our targets are .
we won &apos;t know that until the survey and the tracking is done .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo , did you have another question or comment .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i guess , i am trying to put it in a way that we might be able to get a response .
traditionally in most territories , provinces and countries , they have a target for what they would like to see in manufacturing , services , those types of industries .
does the department have targets in these areas and what they would like to see , not only in those areas , but also in the traditional economy area as well .
thank you mr. speaker .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
i am not mr. speaker , i am just a chairperson .
minister of sustainable development , you wanted to respond to that .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
as i indicated earlier that is all i can say at this time .
now the traditional economy should be , i can &apos;t say what it should be .
we haven &apos;t as a department set any targets that the member is talking about .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. minister .
mr. tootoo did you have something else ?
go ahead .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
sorry about that error there .
does the department have any again , target figures , that they &apos;d like to see or is it just a general statement and targets will be figured out down the road ?
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of sustainable development .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
if more took advantage of education system and taking on the opportunities that are offered in private and in public sectors .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. tootoo did you want to say something else ?
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i &apos;m just wondering mr. chairman , does that increase equal the increase in population in that area because to me it would the population rate increases faster than the job rate .
it &apos;s not really doing anything .
so i &apos;m just wondering if there has been a look at that comparison as to whether its keeping up with the population growth as well .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of sustainable development .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
we have not had a per se tracking of that .
but when we &apos;re looking at the job availability in nunavut , that &apos;s all we looked at . not the way you &apos;re saying .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. minister .
i want to talk about the business side of the operation in community futures program where they provide loans to viable businesses in nunavut .
i &apos;m wondering if that &apos;s something that the department is looking at .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. minister or your deputy minister may respond .
go ahead .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
the department is mandated to undertake such programs but it has not been started .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. tootoo did you have something else ?
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , just a comment on that .
that would enable those businesses and ventures to be able to utilize those services again freeing up dollars that the department or the government would have to put into that .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. minister if you want to respond to that comment .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
what he was talking about is known .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo , did you have something else ?
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
i think it &apos;s one of our salvations is to see this happen , a mine open .
a mine in my community , or close to my community would have a tremendous impact .
it didn &apos;t seem to really have any impact .
how would his department make this situation somewhat easier to encourage enhanced mining exploration and mining development in nunavut .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. minister of sustainable development .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
as i mentioned earlier in my opening comments , i think that we have the poorest administration of exploration , in nunavut .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. o &apos;brien , did you have something else ?
mr. o &apos;brien :
i &apos;m not saying anyway that we should be doing favours to anybody especially the mining companies .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister of sustainable development did you wish to add anything ?
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
yes , thank you mr. chairman .
i think i &apos;ll ask my deputy minister to further respond to that .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
ms. trumper :
mr. chairman , i will offer a little bit background on what we have done to prepare for this year in the mining industry .
we just completed a survey to all mining exploration companies operating in nunavut .
they were written by the department and asked to comment on the very thing that you &apos;re talking about .
how easy is it for you to operate in nunavut ?
we had a fairly good response in that survey and identified some of the areas that they have concerns about in terms of setting up operations in nunavut .
we &apos;re in discussion with nti on creating a one channel through which mining companies can operate and with the nunavut impact review board and finally i should note that the geo science initiative .
so that initiative this year is to try to catch up to the other jurisdictions in canada who have considerably better geographic science data base than we do .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you deputy minister of sustainable development .
mr. o &apos;brien are you done or would you like to make further comments .
mr. o &apos;brien :
no , that &apos;s fine mr. chairman .
thank you and i thank the minister and his deputy for their response .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. chairman .
these are just my comments .
i &apos;ll get into questions on line by line .
outside investment to me is very , very , important for the economy in nunavut .
how do we attract that outside investment ?
whether its joint partnerships which i would encourage , or whether its non-renewable resources sector or even the renewable resource sector like fishing and seal pelts and caribou pelts and things like that .
i think there should be some alliances made with provinces
green or environmental friendly and stuff like that so we have a health environmentally friendly products here in regards to that .
internal investment . maybe i know that this is not your department it should be maybe the minister of finance &apos;s .
but there is a lot of flow of dollars , a tremendous amount of dollars , from people living here going south to bank accounts and mortgages and things like that .
there is nothing to retain the wealth that &apos;s given to this territory and it &apos;s also what used to happen in the northwest territories .
nothing is here , to retain the wealth that &apos;s given to us so we can keep it to reinvest it and build up equity in nunavut . nunavut tourism .
unemployment rate .
and like i say , i don &apos;t know who &apos;s responsible for bringing these unemployment rates but they &apos;re totally incorrect as far as i &apos;m concerned .
i think we &apos;re getting to a point in nunavut now that we probably have 3 categories of communities .
and then we have decentralization coming which is going to help communities like mine , that have an unemployment rate of 60 or 70 % full-time that going to help .
but what about smaller communities .
they should be treated a bit differently .
they should be given a little bit more care and funding when it comes to economic development . in regards to economic development there is one thing that i want you to remember .
the largest employer , the second largest employer of people in nunavut is the private sector .
and sometimes we don &apos;t recognize as a private sector enough for their commitment into investing money , into their own community and into nunavut .
so i want you to remember that the private sector is the second largest support business for people support of employees in nunavut .
i know we have edo &apos;s in all our community and most of them are local and bilingual and they can explain this process .
that &apos;s okay if you &apos;re in an area of 600 thousand people .
if you got some person that wants to bip because they need it , they &apos;ve got these massive amounts of forms .
and the other thing i want to know , its been puzzling me a lot in the last year or two , is how this bip and article 24 mesh together to benefit everybody .
like article 24 is something else .
but in the region that i come from article 24 is a big deal .
and it &apos;s going to come up in the future how this meshes together .
that &apos;s it for me , thank you mr. minister .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. mclean .
your comments are understandable and clear .
minister of sustainable development .
care to respond .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
i know that you made some comments but no questions , but i &apos;ll go ahead and answer .
anyhow , i &apos;ll give you a good example on how nunavut government enter into negotiations in terms of trade and selling traditional products .
i concur with your concerns that we have to look at all these measures , their agreements and our programs within my department and the business incentive policy are confusing and not quite clear .
i know that &apos;s because it &apos;s being controlled and managed by two bodies , but this fall this incentive policy will be reviewed .
i would like to thank you for your comments and thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister of sustainable development .
mr. mclean &apos;s supplementary .
thank you .
perhaps we can take a break . a 15 minute break .
&gt; &gt; committee recessed at 3 : 04 and resumed at 3 : 23pm
chairperson ( interpretation ) : there is only 8 we need 10 .
there is only 8 members .
we now have a quorum .
mr. irqittuq was the next one to ask questions .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
before i ask my question , i &apos;d like to make a statement .
the minister of sustainable development in his opening remarks mentioned fisheries .
but at this time in our communities it is kind of hard to sell fish at this time and i know that we have commercial fisheries .
i &apos;d like to see some kind of research done or a marketing promotion done to do commercial fishing to sell our fish to certain southern markets .
i &apos;m wondering what the red tape is in selling our fish to the southern markets .
they can only provide so much quota according to the research being done , the lakes in our communities .
economic development in our communities is something you have to really work for .
we haven &apos;t really found anything that is worthwhile to sell from our communities .
there is very low market for inuit carvings , arts and crafts and the arctic co-ops were buying and selling carvings but that when we down because due to the lack of poor carvings .
they weren &apos;t satisfied with the quality of the carvings so they stopped selling .
buying and selling our carvings had really destroyed our economy in our communities .
i wanted to mention that first . its more of a comment and not a question .
i have question .
few questions . first of all , the allocation of these main estimates .
the hamlet economic development officers in nunavut have been allocated 2 million , eight hundred , thirty-five dollars .
how are you going to distribute those allocations ?
per capita ?
how is the formula financed ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
we &apos;re going to be getting into the financial departments or financial main estimates but perhaps the minister of sustainable development or the deputy minister would like to respond .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
you mentioned the fisheries and its nothing new to me .
i &apos;ve really experienced the red tape and road blocks that we encountered in pangnirtung .
i &apos;m going to answer your question first .
i &apos;d really like to talk about fish but i &apos;ll answer your question
we have reports on fisheries if you &apos;re interested .
the allocation of funds that &apos;s going to be distributed to the hamlets for community economic development officers .
for example , the larger communities follow the person year . full-time person year .
the smaller communities will be given a half time person year .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. irqittuq anything else .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
so i won &apos;t be talking about anything to do with finances right now but i &apos;ll ask later .
thank you mr. chairman .
mostly a comment i &apos;d like to make .
some problems that we encountered when we were under the government of the northwest territories and i &apos;m sure it &apos;s going to be amended by this present government .
i mentioned this before , i &apos;ve talked about it a lot since it &apos;s got to do with business .
the gnwt &apos;s business incentive policy stated earlier . we were using gnwt business incentive policy and now we &apos;re the nunavut government .
the policy is not compatible to nunavut .
there had been a lot of problems encountered with those business incentive policy .
if i &apos;m going to be using nunavut government &apos;s money . if i wanted to buy something , we would have to apply .
i would have to make an application using the gnwt application forms if i wanted to buy a vehicle .
i &apos;m sure we &apos;re going to have to use the gnwt forms before we buy anything from outside the government of nunavut .
for example , the kingland ford vehicles that the government purchases .
if we had to buy construction materials or things like that for nunavut government according to bip of the gnwt we have to use those certain private businesses .
if and when the government of nunavut looks into amending the bip , i think that we should look for companies who are cheapest or who have cheaper estimates or budgets , materials .
i think we should be able to purchase materials or do contracts with the cheapest company .
we have to think about article 24 as well .
i &apos;d really like to encourage you to work really hard in trying to make this easier for nunavut .
this was just a comment .
mr. chairman , when we go to main estimates i &apos;ll have some more questions .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
minister of sustainable development , would you like to respond ?
hon. peter kilabuk :
thank you .
you stated that it was a comment .
just to clarify a bit .
this business incentive policy is being used in nunavut at this time that was used in the previous government .
we &apos;re going to be reviewing it this summer .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
i don &apos;t have anything else from the floor .
anybody else from the floor ?
mr. irqittuq would you like to take the chair .
chairperson - ( mr. irqittuq ) ( interpretation ) :
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
there were going to be board members comprising this organization who would be reviewing any arts and crafts policies .
have you heard about that ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. kilabuk
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
during my opening remarks the nunavut arts and crafts council we mentioned that we wanted to work with this inuit art foundation .
we &apos;ve been helping them with grants and contributions .
they made an official proposal and we &apos;ve been able to provide them with grants .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. akesuk
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
this art foundation that is in place as an official board .
have you talked with them recently ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
sorry mr. chairman .
they haven &apos;t set up a date yet to hold a meeting but they &apos;re working on the business plans right now .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
is that it ?
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i have a very important question to ask concerning mining .
yesterday there was a letter read stating concerning different contracts in nunavut government .
as residents of nunavut we don &apos;t have any mining companies or exploration companies that are placed in nunavut .
these exploration and mining construction companies come from down south and they &apos;re not from nunavut .
these contracts are huge especially in the mining field .
these contracts will be directed to nunavut and i &apos;m sure were going to encounter some problems .
have you had discussions about this ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
speaker , sorry , chairman .
i can &apos;t say very much right now about this .
i know there is no mining company here in nunavut .
these mining companies or exploration companies use their own funds to do prospecting or do geological surveys .
those exploration companies who like do to some mining in our communities or exploration make a request to do so if its going to be under 5,000 dollars .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
i do not like hearing that there isn &apos;t going to be any mining companies established in nunavut .
my ears don &apos;t like that .
it &apos;s just as an organization and as inuit people we can become one of , we can establish our own mining company and be a competitive company in the world .
i &apos;m sure were going to have to look towards building our own mining companies .
mining exploration generates a lot of money .
as a nunavut resident we &apos;d like to be able to benefit economically from mining because there is a lot of iron ore , in our resources in our lands .
it can be very economically viable for us .
by establishing a company or a corporation that will be situated and placed in nunavut , there is a lot of money to be made .
it &apos;s just a comment i &apos;d like to make .
i &apos;ll have something else to say after .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
would you like to respond ?
mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
as i mentioned in my opening remarks , that you mentioned about contracts that we don &apos;t have mining companies here .
we don &apos;t have any mining companies as yet .
as i mentioned , these private sectors , mining companies use their own funds to do exploring .
if and when we can establish our own mining company then we can do the developing .
that &apos;s all i can say for now .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
it &apos;s very interesting .
i like your response .
i use to think that of the gnwt ; how come as residents of nunavut we can &apos;t get a mining company of our own ?
i use to think that .
i think , its our land .
we should be the ones exploring our lands .
we can make a lot of money through mining .
that could generate a lot of money for nunavut and that &apos;s a very important thing for the people of nunavut .
i &apos;m going to have another question .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i just understood this , you were talking about having our own mining company , i was thinking more like a government official .
i was thinking about that the department &apos;s economic development , so i apologize for that first .
for those people wishing to develop or establish a mining company i would definitely encourage people to start up their own companies to do mining like in kitikmeot .
there has already been development plans in running your own business for mining business .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
remind me when my time is up .
concerning different contracts that will be coming out of your department for economic development because that &apos;s always the case when there is economic development and you &apos;ll be granting contracts in nunavut .
there are a lot of potential businesses that could be established .
those contracts that you grant to businesses , i &apos;m sure it &apos;s obvious that you &apos;ll have to allocate these contracts for businesses outside of nunavut .
have you thought about this as well , encouraging small businesses .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
yes , thank you mr. chairman .
yes within our department &apos;s operations i know that there is a huge contract allotted in my department .
they will continue with the existing contracts that were inherited with the existing companies .
some of the contracts , so that some of the contracts that were in place with the gnwt so that they could continue .
i know , we know where the situation is .
we know where it is going also .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you . mr. chairman .
another question .
we would like to encourage private businesses to be established . since your department is the supporter of initiating businesses with the previous government .
it was pretty hard to initiate your own private businesses with all the bureaucracy that you had to go through when applying for fund to start your own business .
if i stated that there was an inuktitut unilingual speaking people will you allow them to apply in your system ?
will you make your system accessible so that the inuktitut unilingual speaking people can apply to your department for business support .
if we are going to treat everybody equally that will have to come up within your system which is evident . i was wondering if you had those kinds of plans in your department .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
in regard to the public making applications . i know it was pretty hard for some inuit people to apply for funding and sometimes it had discouraged potential applicants from applying for incentive dollars .
we are now accumulating and collecting and reviewing the system .
the residents of the communities from the public , if they &apos;re going to be applying for funds they will go through the economic development officer in the communities .
some will be free of charge .
some will be just grants and some will be loan .
in regards to getting staff members who are bilingual people . the community economic development officers in the communities are 85 % inuit and 15 % are non-inuit .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman for your appropriate answer .
i &apos;m smiling away here now .
however , i would like to ask another question , as a nunavut resident .
somebody had asked that question in regards to finances about the co-ops wanting to establish credit unions .
i want you to know that not all the communities in nunavut have co-ops established so we will not be able to reach all the communities with your proposal .
perhaps we should find a better means or other ways of means for those communities that don &apos;t have co-ops .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
at this time , for the communities that have requested a credit union they go through the co-op i know it &apos;s entirely true that not all the communities in nunavut have co-ops .
if this can go ahead before it does go ahead we will review it as to how we can find other means for the communities that don &apos;t have co-ops .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
when we go to the main estimates i know that i &apos;ll be asking many more questions but i have no further questions .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i would like to ask this question .
i don &apos;t know how many people deal with wildlife issues .
nunavut government wildlife department , there are many wildlife departments , there is the nwmb , there are regional wildlife boards and there is a wildlife function in your department .
so i am afraid there might be confusion .
i would like to get clarification as to how that relationship works .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
for the department of sustainable development , the wildlife officers are the enforcers of the law and they also work on environmental issues to protect the environment .
the wildlife officers also work on conservation areas .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
the reason i asked this question is because of the regulations .
for example the polar bear regulations are the responsibility of the nwmb , which i am sure that they have set the guidelines and regulations for polar bears .
if the community had any concerns in regards to that , when they ask your department will you just pass the buck ? ... to them ? .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i have a few questions after hearing some comments .
mining was mentioned as one of the things that is important to look at and also the development , prior to mining coming in the exploration phase .
i am not an expert on exploration but i would venture to guess that it is a rather specialized area .
i know that there had previously been some training and development in the kivalliq region and in this area .
i am just wondering if there are any plans to continue with training in this area in nunavut .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
we do have a budget for nunavut exploration .
we have set aside some funds , 102 thousand dollars for exploration use .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
another thing with mining as the minister made quite clear in his statement is that it effects our land .
the land is one of the most important resources and once it is used up it is something that never comes back .
mr. chairman , i would like to ask the minister , i know that in his statements he talks about a balance between the protection of the land and economic development .
i know and i have seen cases where one can go in with the best intentions of working out a compromise when it comes to this type of development .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
yes . thank you .
the nunavut impact review board has been established and implemented .
the applications go to the impact review board from the companies .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i don &apos;t totally understand this .
pardon my ignorance .
are you saying that it goes through the board and they approve the development or not .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk , you have a point of order .
hon. james arvaluk :
pardon me if i am wrong .
i think the question is more to do with the legislation or regulation issues , not in the budget rather maybe in october , maybe in the legislation session .
correct me if i am wrong .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
at this point we don &apos;t know if his comments are in line with the department system or what you are saying .
but you may go ahead .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i don &apos;t need a response to that right now but it is just something that i had thought about as the discussion went along with mining .
i wouldn &apos;t mind if i could get a reply to that in the future .
going on to the bip policy that a member talked about earlier .
along with that there was a policy called a northern manufactured goods policy .
i am just wondering if that has also been brought over from the gnwt to the government of nunavut .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
yes , thank you .
i apologize mr. tootoo , this was cut off as only one firm was covered .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , throughout the ministers &apos; statement it talks about the need to try and retain dollars in nunavut , and that is something that i firmly believe in as well .
it just wouldn &apos;t put them on the same level playing field with someone manufacturing these products in the south .
i am just wondering if that is something that the department will look at .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
at this time we still won &apos;t get any legislation geared toward individuals things .
but i also want to assure you that we will be looking into and reviewing this issue this coming fall .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
if i could go back to the ministers &apos; comments on the fact that the manufactured goods policy was a one-time thing .
if that is the case , i thought it was a policy , along with part and parcel with the business incentive policy .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i was getting whispered to by my deputy minister from what the interpreters were saying .
we can &apos;t make legislation that deals with only one person .
i would like to inquire what the interpreters said , because i didn &apos;t hear all of the question .
i would like him to repeat it .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
i was just referring to your comments earlier about the northern manufactured goods policy being a one time thing .
i am under the understanding that it was a policy that was part and parcel of the business incentive policy , geared towards northern manufacturers .
if that makes it a little bit clearer , i just wanted to provide some clarification .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
regarding the question that you are talking about , i think my deputy minister was part of the review team .
perhaps i should ask her to reply to this question .
chairperson :
ms. trumper .
ms. trumper :
mr. chairman , in adopting the bip on an interim basis for nunavut , they looked at the policy and the gnwt had added to the bip policy two or three directives .
one was the commercial accommodation directive which directed contractors doing business with the government to stay in commercial accommodations .
the other one was the northern manufacturers directive which you were speaking about .
they have taken that out of bip with the intention of examining those as stand-alone policies .
but that would fall into the department of public works , so i can &apos;t speak with definition on where they are in that process now .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
there is no way that any company or individual or firm could be able to compete at the same level as a southern manufacturer .
so i am just asking , and i am encouraged to hear that it is something that is going to be looked at as a separate policy .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
we have an interim business incentive policy which came from gnwt and it is due for a review in october .
we are not certain who is going to be responsible for these policies and we &apos;ll just stay with the old gnwt policies and directives in the meantime .
i can &apos;t tell you right now which way it is going to be done but we &apos;ll do that by october .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
i have two speakers mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
in your opening remarks you mentioned article 24 and that this would be incorporated into your department and we can &apos;t go any other way because it is under the nunavut land claims agreement .
there are many companies who are not 51 % owned .
if this is going to be the case then we have to communicate this policy very explicitly to the residents of nunavut .
according to the figures that you were quoting in your opening remarks , so are you going to adhere to that policy or are you looking for a new policy .
chairperson :
mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
yes it is true what you are saying .
it has to be very clearly communicated to the people .
our department can assist in communicating this policy to the residents of nunavut .
a company has to be 51 % owned by inuit or northerners .
we have to communicate this to the public and it is the department &apos;s intention to do that , whether it be in a different department or not .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
there are many companies which are not 51 % owned by inuit .
as the department of sustainable development , for those companies under 51 % you won &apos;t be able to do anything for them or require them to adhere to article 24 .
chairperson :
mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
the question was more complicated than it sounded , but the way it is set up right now if they are under 51 % we can &apos;t require them to do anything .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
yes , it is true , i know this answer to be true .
my other question is for the department of sustainable development , they are also responsible for renewable resources , or wildlife .
as the minister that is under your portfolio .
there are hunters and trappers organizations in the communities and they have had no say in who gets the study funds , for wildlife studies .
sometimes the government just goes ahead and approves a project that is going to have an impact in the communities without going through the hunter / trapper organizations .
are you going to be revisiting that area ?
chairperson :
mr. minister .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
the studies on wildlife , studies are one of the most important things that we do as a department .
some of the decisions are based on a lot of the studies that are conducted in the north .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
so the people who are proposing to work with you , would you be providing them with funds to conduct studies for you or do they have to apply for funding from somewhere else .
chairperson :
mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
that will depend on the proponents .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu . you are running out of time .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
i will try to make this short , i don &apos;t think that i will be able to ask all of the questions that i want to ask .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
it would depend on what the proposal was .
if they requested funds and didn &apos;t provide the details , i don &apos;t think they would get the funds .
this is the same for any organization or any community , or individual .
if there is a proposal , and it is viable , then it would be considered .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
i think that our hto has been proposing to do studies on whales .
if the hto wrote a proposal to do that study would you give them the funds to carry out that study .
chairperson :
mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
it would depend on what kind of study they would want to do , because whales fall under the dfo , which is under the government of canada .
we would have to look at their proposal and we would respond appropriately .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
yes , i understand .
thank you .
i think that i am out of time . thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
maybe if you take your chair back you might go faster .
i don &apos;t have any other speakers .
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :

mr. chairman , i just have one question here .
is it in these grants &amp; contributions that the dollars are allocated to the business development fund and programs that lend money to businesses starting up .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
did you want your financial comptroller to come to the table .
is that your financial manager .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
mr. chairman he is our finance officer , maybe he should join us at the table , he has those details .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
okay he can come up .
mr. kilabuk if you could introduce the new person joining you at the table .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
his name is jim martin , he is a finance officer .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , welcome to the committee mr. martin .
so who is going to respond to the question that was just asked .
go ahead mr. martin .
mr. martin :
thank you mr. chairman .
this year there has been an amount approved at the recent kimmirut retreat and this amount has been set aside for 1.1 million .
it is within this fund that the department would be delivering the activity .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i guess after thinking about it , i asked the wrong question .
i guess i should have asked , i would imagine that the outstanding balances from the past business credit corporation would be factored into the division of assets and liabilities within the region .
i am just wondering if you can maybe give me some information on that .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) : thank you mr. chairman .
i will ask our finance , our finance guy will have to work for his money , so i am going to ask him to reply to that .
mr. martin :
again , that is subject to the finalization of the agreement on division of assets and liabilities .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i guess in any loan portfolio that is out there , there is always a provision for write off &apos;s in there .
thank you mr. chairman.0
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
go ahead , mr. martin .
mr. martin :
thank you mr. chairman .
with regards to the 7 million loan portfolio , as part of the asset and liability division process , there is significant interest being taken in write-off procedures .
so it is anticipated that the preliminary 7 million estimate being provided would reflect all of the appropriate write downs for year end .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
while we are on this detail , when you are providing grants &amp; contributions to new businesses being developed , i wonder if this is the only funding program for newly established businesses .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i think his question is in regards to small businesses being established and how we provide assistance for them .
if that is included in the proposal and that &apos;s approved , they can also get grants &amp; contributions and loans from this program .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .

thank you mr. chairman .
i talked about this during my opening statements .
the nunavut geoscience consists of mineral exploration and research within nunavut .
the office will be located within iqaluit , due to the fact that they have to work closely with the other governments .

chairperson :
mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :

do you agree .
agreed .
detail of grants &amp; contributions , mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. chairman .
in regards to the community initiative fund , is that what we refer to , on page 11 - 10 , as the cip fund .
my colleague brought it up earlier under the grants and contributions in regards to training for mineral development .
we have presently 2200 people enrolled in school , elementary and secondary school in keewatin .
there is the potential for two gold mines to open up in the keewatin within the next 2 - 5 years .
with those two gold mines comes approximately 500 jobs . 500 jobs times an average of 80 thousand dollars a year works out to quite a few dollars .
from those jobs comes taxes , that go right back to the federal government .
the price that was put on the diamond mine in yellowknife was a billion dollars in taxes and royalties that flows to the federal government and that the nwt does not get .
there is no money identified in the budget anywhere , or very little of it to train a work force starting now , for when these mines are on the go .
there is hardly anything identified .
what we call it in the keewatin , is pre-mining training and it covers a broad base .
thank you .
chairperson :
his question is lengthy .
mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i &apos;ll ask my deputy minister to answer that .
chairperson :
ms. trumper .
ms. trumper :
thank you mr. chairman .
the member is correct , there is nothing specific in the budget for ramping up to the two good gold mine prospects in the keewatin .
i think this is something that the time has come with the two projects advancing as quickly as they are in the keewatin .
it has been a long process with them so far .
chairperson :
mr. mclean .
briefly .
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. chairman ..
so i hope that the minister identifies that immediately .

gjoa haven gathering
hon. paul okalik :
mr. speaker i rise today to thank the people of gjoa haven for their wonderful hospitality yesterday .
as you are aware , i had the honour of travelling to gjoa haven with mr. puqiqnak , mr. alakannuark , and ministers thompson , and picco to attend the kitikmeot leaders forum .
i am pleased to inform this house , mr. speaker that the meeting was very productive .
elected mla &apos;s and cabinet ministers sat down and discussed issues of concern with elected mayors , councillors , and representatives from inuit organizations .
the mayors were able to inform us of their concerns and we were able to provide an update on our direction .
in gjoa haven , we had frank discussion on a number of different issues .
my colleague , the minister of health and social services was able to provide the kitikmeot leaders with an update on the plans for the dissolution of the health and social services boards .
my colleague , minister thompson , discussed the gjoa haven gas issue .
as a team we discussed capital plans with some of the mayors .
mr. speaker , we may not have agreed on every issue , but i think that the discussions themselves are what are important .
this government is committed to decentralization not only in terms of jobs , but also in terms of governance .
mr. speaker , i have the utmost confidence in our leadership in nunavut .
again , mr. speaker , i would like to thank the people of gjoa haven for their wonderful hospitality .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you mr. okalik .

ministers &apos; statement 32 - 1 ( 2 ) :
congratulations to graduates
hon. james arvaluk :
mr. speaker , i wish to take this opportunity to congratulate all the nunavut graduates of 1999 .
their hard work and determination has taken them this far and will lead them into the future .
this group are the first graduates in our new territory of nunavut .
they are also the last to graduate in this millennium .
just as great hope and possibilities extend before us in nunavut , we hold great hope for these young people .
as the geese are in flight again across our vast land , i hope that they will take time to consider their new flight plans and new directions .
i also encourage them to take advantage of further training opportunities .
however , like the geese who always return , i look forward to each one of these graduates eventually taking their places as leaders and builders of nunavut .
thank you mr. speaker

on june 12 , 1999 , ms. nancy hyland , the director of adult education will attend graduation ceremonies at the university in chicago , illinois .

i had not had the chance to meet with some of the people there and i was able to meet with them and that was appreciated .

members &apos; statement 93 - 1 ( 2 ) :
mineral accord
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. speaker .
nunavut , in particular the keewatin region , has some of the richest mineral deposits in canada .
but unfortunately , with the prices of gold at a low the exploration and mine activity has decreased for the time being .
mr. speaker , while the market is in this soft stage i strongly support suggest that the government of nunavut should be advancing a mineral accord with diand and the federal government .
there are many benefits to such an accord , such as the royalties .
this would greatly assist this government with its future capital projects .
let &apos;s not let this opportunity slip away from us as it did in the former government .
mr. speaker let &apos;s not allow the multi-million dollars in royalties slip away from our grasp that nunavut needs so badly .
thank you .

question 189 - 1 ( 2 ) :
status of whales stuck in sea ice
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
this is in regards to some narwhals that were stuck near grise fiord , i was wondering if the government is doing anything about this .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
mr. kilabuk , minister of sustainable development .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
we are presently looking into the matter .
there are narwhals that were stuck near grise fiord and the wildlife officers are presently trying to free them .
on may 27th the hunters located the narwhals that were stuck due to the ice and they requested funding to fund the saving of the narwhals .
from the community there were four bodies that were given reports . they were about 20 - 40 metres from the community .
another one was 700 meters away from the community . there were approximately 9 dead narwhals , and some were eaten previously by polar bears .
there were about 9 polar bears that were sighted near the stuck narwhals .
they were approximately away from the floe edge . there were 17 narwhals attacked by the polar bears and as they were injured the hunters wanted killed them as they felt sorry for them .
the meat was distributed to the surrounding communities for the people to eat so the meat was not wasted .
they had to save the narwhals fearing that the polar bears would attack them again .
there have been four breathing holes fixed by the hunters and currently the funds that we provided will be used to open up more breathing spaces so the narwhals will be able to survive .
the community hunters and trappers association was carrying out this work as well as the wildlife officer who is monitoring and acting as the information officer for the project , sigluk akeeagok .
also yesterday there was 1 thousand dollars donated and the money will be used to monitor the trapped whales .
this was agreed to and they will be requesting further assistance as the need arises .
also mr. speaker , the hto and the hunters have been working very hard to save the whales and we are very proud of them for the efforts that they are making .
thank you mr. speaker .

mr. puqiqnak .
question 191 - 1 ( 2 ) :
travel assistance for inuit broadcasting corporation
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question , i am not sure which minister i should be directing it to .
i think it should be directed to the minister of communications .
my question is that in my community the inuit broadcasting corporation are headquartered out of taloyoak , and i am proud that they have a branch over there .
but my question is that there are five communities in the kitikmeot region and ibc work in taloyoak and they are responsible for all of the five communities .
how are they being funded for these kinds of projects .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
minister responsible for public works , telecommunications &amp; technical services , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
ibc is funded through federal government programs , i am not responsible for that company i think there is some confusion about what my department is responsible for .
we are mostly looking after things like computers and telephones for the government departments .
so , the question the minister is asking is more to do with a private corporation and i think that they &apos;re the only people who can answer his question .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you ms. thompson .
oral question , mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) : thank you mr. speaker .
yes , i understand now .
so nunavut government is not involved whatsoever with ibc .
we can &apos;t do anything about what a corporation does .
speaker :
thank you mr. puqiqnak . . minister responsible for public works , telecommunications &amp; technical services , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
we can give support as a government and if a community feels neglected by a private company , we can give them a letter of support specifically .
what i am saying is that as the minister of public works , telecommunications &amp; technical services we are not an agency that funds these organizations and those programs are through the federal government .
however we can provide a letter of support to say that they should be attending the communities that the member was talking about .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you ms. thompson .
oral questions . mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) : thank you mr. speaker .
thank you to the minister for answering my question .
for that reason the ibc i think that we should be providing support to them because they are providing an important duty in the north in the area of communications .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. puqiqnak . minister responsible for public works , telecommunications &amp; technical services , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i think that the department of culture , language , elders &amp; youth , his department is more responsible for programs such as ibc .
ibc are headquartered in iqaluit .
perhaps if the member wanted to meet with members of ibc he can arrange that outside of this meeting because this is completely outside of my portfolio .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. thompson .

gravel pads rather than piles
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) : thank you mr. speaker .
this is directed to the minister of community government , housing &amp; transportation .
ever since the gravel pads were stopped and all the building foundations are now built on piles , i think the houses depreciate much quicker than they used to .
i would like to see gravel pads being built where the houses are being built .
i wonder if that is going to be put back in place .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu , minister responsible for community government , housing &amp; transportation . mr. anawak .

see you later .
&gt; &gt; committee recessed at 12 : 00 and resumed at 1 : 30 pm
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
lets start again .
we will now ask the premier to present the budget for his department .
mr. okalik
budget presentation 1999 / 2000 for the department of executive
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
iksivautuq , today we are considering the budget of the department of executive and intergovernmental affairs ( eia ) .
the total budget for the department is $ 7.734m.
eia is one of the smallest departments .
it has no capital funds , and one grant or contribution .
it has a total of 51 employees :
employees work as executive assistants or executive secretaries to the 7 ministers .
4 employees work in the office of the premier .
they are the executive secretary , the executive assistant , the press secretary and the principal secretary .
1 employee works as the executive secretary to the commissioner of nunavut .
these 19 people are all considered to be political appointments .
they are hired directly by the individual ministers , the premier or the commissioner , and work directly for them .
the head of this department has two titles .
she is the deputy minister of executive and intergovernmental affairs and she is the secretary to cabinet . 5 people work in the directorate to support these functions .
they are the deputy minister , one cabinet registrar , one finance manager , one office manager and one interpreter / translator .
they organize and manage the work and the finances of the department .
8 people work in the policy function .
they include the assistant deputy minister , one director , three policy advisors , two trainees and one support staff .
they provide centralized policy development for all departments and generally analyze policy recommendations coming to cabinet .
4 people work in communications .
their job is to communicate government initiatives to the public , to deal with questions and issues from others and to look after protocol with visitors .
7 people work in statistics and evaluations .
they collect the numbers and information the government needs to understand and plan what is needed in nunavut .
they include auditors to check money and how it is spent , and program specialists to assess how programs are operating .
8 people work in intergovernmental affairs . 3 of these people work in our ottawa office .
they support elected officials and departments when they go to ottawa .
they attend meetings for the government of nunavut and save us money when we don &apos;t need to pay airfares . 5 people work in iqaluit .
they assist in our relationships with other governments , at first ministers conferences , and with our relationship with nti and our obligations as a government under the land claim .
they are responsible for monitoring our agreements with the gnwt .
there is a $ 100,000 budget the commissioner &apos;s office that will cover the costs of staff and basic o &amp; m expenses .
office accommodation expenses are captured in the pwtts budget and other commissioner &apos;s costs will be paid directly by the government of canada .
the budget for the nunavut cabinet includes minister &apos;s salaries , offices , and support staff .
each minister is also provided a budget to cover ministerial travel and other expenses .
with the help of the department of finance and administration , these budget numbers were put together despite the fact that we had nothing to compare with but the gnwt &apos;s historical numbers .
like other department &apos;s , we are using common o &amp; m assumptions , which may change in next year &apos;s budget process .
for example , each trip in nunavut is costed at $ 3,000 per trip ;
training per staff person is estimated at $ 1,000 per employee ;
and telephone costs are estimated at $ 2,000 per employee .
the point is , these numbers are the best estimates for this year , but our estimates next year will be even better as we will have something to compare to .
on the political side , 19 of 19 positions are filled , as each minister &apos;s office is fully supported .
on the cabinet and department side 17 of 32 positions are filled which is 53 % .
inuit employees represent 47 % of the iqaluit positions .
iksivautuq , i will now conclude by stating that the department of executive and intergovernmental affairs has made a lot of progress in meeting its broad mandate .
the budget appropriation requested in the main estimates will enable the department to meet its objectives in 99 / 2000 .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :

with respect to federal-nunavut relations , the committee was supportive of the premier &apos;s efforts to identify additional resources wherever possible , during discussions with federal ministers .

the committee shared the premier &apos;s dissatisfaction with this situation , and is supportive of any efforts that can be made to resolve it .
appointments to boards and agencies
during discussions with the committee , the premier stated his desire for an open approach to the issue .
he stressed the need for more women to be appointed to such nunavut bodies .
the committee emphasized its view that the appointments process should involve regular members of the assembly .
relations between cabinet and regular members

mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , just kind of a comment and a question .
in a number of the reports that the committee has heard over the past couple of weeks , there have been a lot of referral back to statistical information .
it is a vital function , mr. chairman , because that is how all the funding basically is applied throughout nunavut and to nunavut from the federal government .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you mr. chairman . ... someone as chief statistician and that &apos;s being worked on now .
that and the numbers for operations , and as well our expenditures .
so we have a numbers person on our payroll now .
we have also been attending meetings with statistics canada , getting their assistance with statistics in our new territory .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you premier okalik .
i don &apos;t have anybody who would like to make general comments .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , just a brief comment or inquiry regarding the power corporation .
we don &apos;t seem to have a clear cut understanding as to where it fits into the overall picture .
i understand that in discussions last week that it may be tied in as a part of your department , intergovernmental affairs .
thank you .
chairperson :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
premier okalik .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you .
i am not the minister responsible for the public utilities board but i will refer the question to laura gauthier , who has been involved for some time on the ntpc file .
okay , if you don &apos;t mind .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you premier , ms. gauthier .
ms. gauthier :
thank you mr. chairman .
in response to mr. o &apos;brien &apos;s question .
his roles and responsibilities in respect of the transition agreement , which has been a document that is allowing for us to look at a continued power corporation for the next two years .
we can certainly make that available to the members , we could make a copy of that .
there is also legislation that has been grandfathered and it will support that ongoing relation for the power corporation for the two territories .
as a sort of sub-body of that is the corporate relations group .
they &apos;re involved at the officials level to look at specific issues for the delivery of power inside of nunavut .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. gauthier .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i know that you have indicated that mr. picco is the lead minister .
my question would be , what actual authority does this government have in reference to the operations and maintenance of this particular utility .
is it not a fact that it is pretty much run , controlled and operated by the authorities in hay river .
basically we are deferring to the gnwt and their ... leave it at that .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
ms. gauthier .
ms. gauthier :
thank you mr. chairman .
with respect to the transition agreement between the nwt and nunavut .
there are , as part of the negotiation process leading up to that transition agreement , there was an understanding that the operations of the power corporation would remain sort of the status quo .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , ms. gauthier .
i am sorry if i mispronounce your name .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i recently saw some correspondence from the hay river office , the president of the utility there to mary king of arviat , regarding some concerns they had .
i don &apos;t believe that the hamlet itself is overly pleased with the response they received , i know i wasn &apos;t when i read it .
it seemed very direct and abrupt , to be kind about it .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
premier okalik .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you mr. chairman .
it is in effect .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
mr. o &apos;brien perhaps you could have a meeting or ask questions of the minister regarding ntpc , don &apos;t forget we are limited to ten minutes on one subject .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
i will be brief in my following comments .
i felt that maybe the control and the authority , the responsibility lay rather in your department .
that was why i was forwarding questions to yourself .
i can wait and speak in more detail during the regular session . thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i don &apos;t think this is a question .
i don &apos;t think it can be directly responded to , but if you wish you may respond , mr. okalik .
i am sorry i don &apos;t have anybody who wishes to speak to the opening remarks .
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , my question is to the premier .
the deputy minister and your assistant deputy ministers are usually inuit , well the assistants are usually inuit .
i am not criticizing your deputy ministers , but your inuit staff seem to be assistant deputy ministers .
do you have a training program whereby the assistant deputy ministers will be given the opportunity to train and get their qualification as deputy ministers .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. akesuk .
mr. okalik .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
as i indicated earlier today we have designated 1 thousand dollars per staff member , so our staff who want to take advantage of further training can do so .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
i don &apos;t think you clarified too much about this 1 thousand dollars .
maybe you could give us a more detailed explanation about what this 1 thousand dollars is for .
clarify for us please .
thank you .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
yes , when i was making my presentation i think this was included for all staff , that there is 1 thousand dollars set aside for each employee for this coming year .
if they wish to take courses or get further training for the coming year .
i hope this clarifies it mr. chairman .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you premier okalik .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
just one more question mr. chairman , back on may 14th i asked the premier for some clarification in regards to the memorandum of understanding that the government is working on with nunavut tunngavik .
mr. chairman , at that time the premier indicated that he did not want to hold up the process as a result of waiting for it to go back to the standing committee .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
thank you mr. tootoo .
premier okalik .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you mr. chairman .
from what i have been advised we have a very rough draft from nti so far .
it requires a considerable amount of work to work out the details and our first priority has been the sitting and we just received the draft just a few days ago .
okay .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
if that could be a possibility , thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
premier okalik .
hon. paul okalik :
mr. chairman , i can make staff available to committee members on the progress of our discussions with nti at this time .
okay ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you premier .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
but a briefing of some kind prior to the finalization of the agreement would be greatly appreciated .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
if you want to respond to that mr. premier you may do so .
i don &apos;t think it is a question but you may respond if you wish .
thank you .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
the residents of nunavut and looking at the future i know that the population is going to grow .
it is going to get more expensive to service the people of nunavut .
i was wondering if this funding has criteria .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
also statistics canada will be assisting us .
we will do the surveys as the population grows and we will have to utilize the statistics again , in order to get more funding from the federal government in the future .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you premier .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
do i understand that the 620 million and the 580 million will only be used for three years and that agreement is for only three years .
do i understand that correctly .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
yes , thank you .
the agreement is for five years but we can reopen it again after three years is over .
some of the funds include population growth .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you premier .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you for the clarification , but at this point 99 / 2000 fiscal year , the funding we have for this fiscal year is already not adequate or enough .
i was wondering if you department will be seeking additional new funds if we don &apos;t have enough .
i wish your department would go look for more funds .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. premier , okalik .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i apologize , it is only after two years not three years that we can reopen this agreement .
we will continue to seek additional funds from wherever we can find them .
we will be open to all these options , whether it be housing , the housing minister is already meeting with the federal government officials to attempt to obtain additional funds .
so we are looking in all aspects of how and where we can find additional funding .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
for your appropriate answer , i don &apos;t know what this is going to mean , but nunavut tunngavik inc. and the nunavut government .
since the nunavut government has been established , i don &apos;t know what the role of to be of nti .
with all these things in mind i think we need to have a clear understanding with that entity as to how the working relationship is going to be .
we have to set the working relationship because both nti and the gn represent the nunavut residents .
does the nti have the same jurisdiction as the nunavut government .
i would like to get all of this cleared up .
so my question is what is happening with that situation .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
as gn we represent all of nunavut residents not just the beneficiaries of nunavut .
we represent the public of nunavut but nti represents solely the beneficiaries of the land claims agreement .
we have to abide by the agreements , especially the wildlife article and article 23 , to hire more inuit and to work on contracts as per article 24 .
we will have to abide by the nunavut land claims agreement even though we are nunavut government .
at this time i cannot tell you what kind of working relationship there is going to be in the future .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
i think that this is self explanatory now .
i don &apos;t have any more names on my list .
are the members ready to go to the main estimates line by line .

mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
in regards to the commissioner of nunavut , what does it really mean , i would like to get clarification on that .

could you clarify that please .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
premier okalik .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :

mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i have a question in regards to the nunavut final agreement .
it seems that this is the first time that the nunavut legislative assembly is having it &apos;s session and here it is saying nunavut final agreement .
could you clarify that for me .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
it should say nunavut land claims final agreement .
everything in there is in the nunavut land claims agreement .
since we have to abide by the agreement , the federal government gives us money for implementing the nunavut final agreement .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i understand your clarification , but the translation i think require amending .
it needs to be more clear , because i don &apos;t want this to be our last session .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
yes , the translation is a literal translation of english .
it should talk about the nunavut final agreement .
which nti , gn and the federal government are responsible for .
this agreement was ratified in 1993 and we will get funds to implement it .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier , we shall continue .
page 2 - 11 , details of grants and contributions .
information item .
do you agree .
some members :
agreed .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
going back to 2 - 3 , detail of expenditures , operations &amp; maintenance total 7 million 734 thousand .
some members :
agreed .
chairperson :
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
where are you mr. chairman , i thought you were on page 2 - 11 , and i had a question on that page .
it talks about the official languages commissioner and the same amount on 2 - 11 .
perhaps there is a mistranslation , could you clarify that for me .
is it okay to go back to 2 - 11 .
some members :
agreed .
chairperson ( interpretation ) : 2 - 11 , mr. okalik .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
the first one is for leadership forums .
this goes along that line and is allotted to the communities .
we will be giving this to the department of community government , housing &amp; transportation because this is geared more towards the communities to prepare and plan for meetings .
second one . circumpolar conference .
the gnwt was also allotting some funds to the inuit circumpolar conference to give them support .
it is mainly for the inuit circumpolar conference .
are you clear now .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. okalik .
the english and the inuktitut aren &apos;t the same even though they are on the same page .
the inuktitut version is totally different .
as i have stated the inuktitut version is mr. havioyak &apos;s department .
the heading on page 2 - 11 in syllabics states that it is for culture , language , elders &amp; youth and they both have 1 million dollars .
i think that the inuktitut has a wrong page in there and perhaps if they were the same , do we get 2 million dollars ?
i would like to get clarification on this because the english and the inuktitut aren &apos;t the same .
perhaps to get good direction we will take a short break so that we will get clarity on this .
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
the english and the syllabics are totally different , 1.1 million dollars and english is 240 thousand .
we have to rectify this situation now by perhaps taking a short break , because the english and the inuktitut don &apos;t correlate .
chairperson ( interpretation ) : we will take a ten minute break to correct this .
&gt; &gt; committee recessed at 2.38 pm
&gt; &gt; committee resumed at 2.58 pm
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
these are informational items , the translations were corrected .
these are just informational items . under 2 - 11 , details of grants and contributions .
are you in agreement . under 2 - 3 , detail of expenditures , total operations &amp; maintenance , 7 million 734 thousand .
some members :
agreed .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
getting back to the correction that needed to be changed earlier , is that a different number now or is it just the same as the english .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. premier , can you clarify .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
yes , the english version was 240 thousand and 7 million 734 thousand is corrected , the inuktitut is corrected but the english version remains the same .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you for making that clear .

&gt; &gt; commissioner takes the chair
item 2 :
throne speech
commissioner maksagak :
please be seated .
elders , mr. speaker , speakers and clerks from chambers across canada , senator , sivuliuqti , maligaliuqtiit , and honoured guests .
i am pleased to welcome you to the opening of the third session of the first legislative assembly of nunavut .
our government has been in existence for just over 200 days .
in that time much has been accomplished :
staffing has increased , government departments are now staffed at 53 % of strength ;
ministers have taken up their assigned portfolios and members their roles .
the transition of existing programs has been astoundingly smooth , and credit must be given for the hard work required to make this happen .
the transition to government in nunavut has been a success but there is much left to do to make this a government of and for nunavut .
this has not been done in isolation .
it has been done with the help and inspiration of the people of the diverse nunavut communities who have hosted this government over the past six months .
the origins of the document are in the first cabinet retreat at kimmirut in april of this year .
it was so sunny and hot that the children of baker lake were down swimming in the strip of open water between the sand and the flow edge .
the hospitality of the people of baker lake was also warm .
members held their sessions outside on a high point of land on the road to prince river .
the sun and wind were strong and the land was showing its colours but still without insects .
this document has been given the name the &quot; bathurst mandate &apos; with thanks for the support and inspiration received from this small , fiercely independent community in the central arctic .
the community &apos;s spirit of independence and the beauty of the land there guided the decisions made .
the final drafts of the mandate were reviewed with many of our partners in government , including the nunavut association of municipalities , nunavut tunngavik inc. and other representative groups .
this bathurst mandate has truly been developed in the spirit of consensus .
it is a demonstration of the unity of spirit in nunavut , that so many elements could be drawn together in a comprehensive and realistic statement of goals and dreams .
the vision the document presents of nunavut is based on four main premises :
inuuqatigiittiarniq - the healthy inter-connection of mind , body and spirit ; pijarnirniqaqsat katujjiqatigiinnirlu - simplicity and unity ;
namminiq makitajunnarniq - self-reliance ; and , ilippallianginnarniq - continuing learning .
inuuqatigiittiarniq
in our government , people will always come first .
our government &apos;s visions is that in the year 2 thousand 20 , nunavut will be a place where self assured , caring communities will respond to the needs of individuals and families .
over the coming months our government will open a public dialogue on housing issues at the same time as developing practical steps to address the need for social housing .
housing is one of our government &apos;s two major priorities . our government will also work with communities to create a capacity plan to build administrative strength and diversity in each community ;
pijarnirniqsat katujjiqatigiinnirlu our government believes that simplicity in the processes of government encourages access , makes tasks more focused and more achievable and invites participation by all nunavummiut .
our government will be looking to all members in this assembly to help ensure that the actions of all government departments and agencies meet our commitment to simplicity and unity .
our government will continue to demonstrate and act upon the commitment to the full implementation of the nunavut land claim agreement , acknowledging the origins of nunavut through article 4 of that agreement .
our government is also committed to working with the nunavut business community to simplify and enhance access to business development and support programs and to build local employment .
it is important that the financial decisions to be made for nunavut are also arrived at in this same spirit of consensus .
to gain from the knowledge of our people , the government will consult with mla &apos;s , community leaders , and the people of nunavut in identifying budget priorities .
these public meetings will give people an opportunity to learn about nunavut &apos;s finances and give the government valuable input as the budget is developed .
a vision for nunavut elders , ladies and gentlemen , and honoured guests , our vision of nunavut is far reaching but it is also achievable .
i am confident of this because we all know that 20 years ago , nunavut itself was a dream which some called impossible .
commitment , hard work and an unrelenting focus on our goals have brought us here today , sitting in the new legislative assembly building for nunavut , planning for our own future .
the full text of the bathurst mandate , which i have highlighted some aspects of , will be tabled by the premier during this legislative session .
during this session our government will be introducing a supplementary appropriations act and the loan authorization act . as well , there are three bills to amend :
i recommend timely passage of each of the bills being brought before this assembly .
i now declare open the third session of the first nunavut legislative assembly .
with that i would like to invite you to join myself , and the speaker and members of this assembly in the foyer for refreshments before the resumption of the order paper .

minister &apos;s statement 01 - 1 ( 3 ) :
gn vision and priorities
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
later today i will be tabling a copy of the bathurst mandate setting out the vision and priorities of this government for the next five years .
this document began in kimmirut during the first cabinet retreat .
a revised version , clarified by the baker lake discussions , was distributed to mlas in july and their comments solicited .
cabinet did a detailed review of the text and principles on which it is based .
in september the document was revised in bathurst inlet by cabinet and the text was sent to every mla in their home community .
in addition , the appropriate portions were discussed with nunavut tunngavik inc. and the association of municipalities .
the document is separated into four sections , inuuqatigiittiarniq - healthy communities , pijarnirnirqsat katujjiqatiriittiarnirlu - simplify and unify and also namminiq makitajunarniq - self-reliance and ilippallianginnarniq - learning .
the actions we have identified are sometimes specific and sometimes general .
they are designed to provide direction to our departments to help them find the priorities in their work and develop a long-term vision in everything we do .
year by year we will develop these goals and build on our successes , supporting and prodding as required .
mr. speaker the path that we have set for ourselves is a challenging one but it is one that we have all chosen .
i am confident that in the footprints of the founders of nunavut , as we work together , we can achieve the goals that we have set for ourselves .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier , mr. okalik .

minister &apos;s statement 02 - 1 ( 3 ) :
appointment of chief coroner
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to inform members and the people of nunavut that we have recently appointed elizabeth copeland of whale cove as chief coroner .
ms. copeland was selected through a competitive process .
one of ms. copeland &apos;s strongest attributes is her community background and her experience as a community coroner , a fact that will serve her well in her new position .
this is an important function and for the first time it is being filled by an inuk .
as well , in keeping with the principles of inuit qaujimajatuqangit , ms. copeland will continue to operate out of her home community .
one of her important tasks will be to give support through training and advice to others working in the field .
we are planning to hire an administrative coroner in the near future .
this person will work together with our chief coroner , ms. copeland .
ms. copeland deserves the congratulations of this legislature in her appointment as chief coroner for nunavut .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister anawak .

minister &apos;s statement : 03 - 1 ( 3 ) minister &apos;s task force on housing
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker i rise today to inform members of our progress to date in housing issues .
as you all know i recently established a ministerial task force on housing .
the lack of access to a range of affordable housing is causing many health and social problems due to overcrowding issues .
( interpretation ends ) the creation of a strategy to address this issue will be through the task force on housing .
this task force consists of four mlas and three housing experts from across nunavut .
the task force role will be central in making recommendations to me to find a lasting solution to the housing problem in nunavut .
mr. speaker i have given the task force the freedom to decide for itself the specific housing issues it will address and discuss but the task force will issue reports to me .
the first report , which i expect on december 1st , will assist in deciding how and where public housing units will be built this summer .
( interpretation ends ) the task force will be consulting with all members of the legislative assembly , members of the public , community representatives and others .
thank you , mr. speaker .

minister &apos;s statement 04 - 1 ( 3 ) :
nunavut &apos;s electrical energy strategy
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i rise today to update this assembly on the activities i have initiated under my portfolio for the northwest territories power corporation in nunavut .
since april , a tremendous amount of time and effort has been dedicated to assessing nunavut &apos;s electrical energy situation .
this time limit is set out in the transition agreement that was signed between the gnwt and the office of the interim commissioner before division .
the agreement states that if there is no agreement on the future operation of ntpc by march 31st , 2000 , then ntpc will be divided between the two territories .
ntpc operations would continue for one more year mr. speaker , until march 31st 2001 , to allow the nunavut power corporation to become operational .
mr. speaker , it is my responsibility to ensure that we fully address nunavut &apos;s options for the supply and delivery of power .
this government must make informed decisions about what course nunavut should take to meet our electrical power needs after march 31 , 2001 .
to do that , we need to fully research and analyze information related to the power corporation and its operations and costs , as well as the needs of our communities .
to accomplish this goal , i assembled a special team this summer called the ikuma working group .
their tasks were to identify , analyze and develop options for safe , reliable and cost efficient power supply and delivery in nunavut .
mr. speaker , they have worked extremely hard and i am pleased to tell you that they will be presenting me with their findings and recommendations at the end of this month .
mr. speaker , as you know , we also recently issued a request for expressions of interest to seven utility companies from across canada .
there were two reasons for this . first , to assist the ikuma group in determining the full costs of potential options by soliciting and negotiating bids with utility companies for headquarter type services .
second , to begin the search for a potential supplier of these types of services for nunavut in case , mr. speaker , in case we decide to pursue a separate nunavut power corporation
i want to ensure that nunavummiut are well informed of our activities and of this government &apos;s commitment to ensure safe and reliable power .
therefore i am launching an information campaign for the public in the very near future .

inuglak school create - a - book award
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the fifteen students worked co-operatively to write and illustrate an original picture book entitled the &quot; lonely inukshuk &quot; .
their creation won the grand prize in the scholastic create-a-book competition .
the inuglak school students book was chosen from over 150 entries from all across canada .
each student also received a medallion , a copy of their published book and a create-a- book t-shirt .
( interpretation ends ) the inuglak school also received a commemorative plaque and a cheque for 1,000 dollars from scholastic book fairs .
i had an opportunity to congratulate the students and teachers involved when i attended an awards ceremony in tikirarjuak , with the hon. manitok thompson and jack anawak .
this book award is a concrete example of the excellence that quality literacy programs can achieve .
the project leaders were sue callard , ken jacobie and michael montcombroux .

item 3 :
members &apos; statements
member &apos;s statement 01 - 1 ( 3 ) :
problems with project surname and census
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to make some comments . in the 1970 &apos;s the government of the nwt signed an agreement to do a census .
our names were put in there and were recognized with our last names , especially by revenue canada .
but the way our last names were written , they were misspelled . also the birth dates are wrong in project surname .
mr. speaker , naming people is very important in any way of life .
the writing of names should be done properly . our ancestors had names with meanings .
when a loved one dies they name their children after them so they can remain close to the memory of their loved ones .
for that reason mr. speaker , in the beginning of our government , we should correct this situation and have the proper surnames written down and that is what i would like to see .
i will use myself as an example , mr. speaker .
my name is misspelled , my mom had named me puqiqnak , puqik meaning the back leg of a caribou .
when project surname was there , my name was changed to pokirk , and that work doesn &apos;t mean anything .
so it puts me down as an inuk person , because my name is misspelled .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
just a reminder on members &apos; statements , you have 2 and a half minutes , let &apos;s try to abide by the guidelines .
mr. irqittuq , member &apos;s statement .
member &apos;s statement 02 - 1 ( 3 ) : congratulations on new legislature
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i am happy to rise today to say that i am very happy to be in this new building .
during our campaign , most of us did not think we would have a nice facility so i would like first today to extend my congratulations to the builders for completing this building .
mr. speaker , i don &apos;t just want to talk about that , i am also very happy that now our summer is over and we are in a beautiful house .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .

member &apos;s statement 03 - 1 ( 3 ) :
sanikiluaq left out of decorative map
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i rise today to talk about the decorations for this house .
this house is decorated by nunavut arts and crafts and it reflects nunavut .
mr. speaker i am very appreciative and proud of all the gifts that we have received from the other canadian jurisdictions and provinces .
but the gift from the federal government , the map , i must say that the decorative map does not reflect all of nunavut .
for example , the ungava bay , hudson bay islands are not included in that gift .
sanikiluaq is not included in that gift mr. speaker , so i would like this to be rectified sometime very soon in the near future .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kattuk .
we will deal with this as soon as we can .
thank you for reminding us about that .

size of legislature
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker i would like to say again that the business we have done within the last six months has been related to the people of nunavut .
i think the public has heard we would be building another legislature for nunavut , but that is not the case .
we want the public to be aware that we would like to welcome each and every one of the people from nunavut .
we should be able to welcome any inuit people or any nunavut residents to come and view the proceedings of the house .
but it is impossible due to the lack of space .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu , for your wise words .

issues to be dealt with in new legislature
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker , mr. speaker i will try and get this done in 2 and 1 / 2 minutes .
thank you , mr. speaker .
it is an honour for me to make my first statement of this session in our new chamber .
this is the people &apos;s house .
it is the arena in which the issues affecting nunavut are discussed ;
and the forum for the elected representatives of nunavummiut to stand up in support of the concerns and aspirations of the constituents we serve .
i encourage all residents of iqaluit to take the opportunity to observe the proceedings of this house from the gallery .
it was good to listen to commissioner maksagak &apos;s speech from the throne yesterday .
the speech was a clear articulation of the priorities and challenges that face this government .
mr. speaker , i do not believe that i am alone when i say that it is now time to get down to the hard work that will make the vision a reality .
we are in our new house .
the appropriate ceremonies have concluded .
ministers and members are familiar with their portfolios and roles .
the senior management of the bureaucracy is in place .
we have held our priority-setting retreats , and reached a broad consensus on where we want to go .
the political direction to departments is clear , and now it is time to start delivering .
to expect immediate solutions to every challenge is not realistic .
mr. speaker , i look forward throughout this session of the legislative assembly to speak out on the issues that my constituents have raised ...
speaker :
excuse me mr. tootoo .
your time is up , you will have to ask for unanimous consent to conclude your statement .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker , i seek unanimous consent to conclude my member &apos;s statement .
speaker :
mr. tootoo is seeking unanimous consent to conclude his statement .
are there any nays .
there are no nays . mr. tootoo , you have unanimous consent .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker and colleagues , i was just about done .
the issues such as the homelessness crisis in iqaluit and other housing related issues .
child care for working families , providing fair opportunities for northern businesses to compete , ensuring that the government lives up to its obligations under the nunavut land claim agreement .
looking for innovative approaches to improving our schools , and rewarding excellence and a fair deal for the members of the nunavut public service .
mr. speaker , our vision as a government is clear .
the language in the throne speech was inspiring .
let &apos;s make those words reality .

appreciation of support during boating trip
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
just this past summer , my colleague right beside me , james arvaluk and i came over here by boat from rankin inlet .
it was an excellent challenge and very enjoyable .
we had motor breakdowns a few times and i think that we have to thank a lot of people .
i apologize if i don &apos;t say their surnames .
also simeonie natsiq from repulse bay , my children robin and amanda , and also peter irnirq and his son .
from coral harbour , who accompanied us also and who was in james &apos; boat , solomon awa , his little brother , james arvaluk kattaluk and erin .
i would like to say thank you to all these people and for the hospitality that was shown in coral harbour , repulse bay , cape dorset and kimmirut and iqaluit .
simon awa and some of his colleagues also helped us when we were coming here to iqaluit .
it was a good trip but very challenging and i would like to say thank you to all those people .

member &apos;s statement 09 - 1 ( 3 ) :
nunavut capital commission
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , during the recent elections one of my promises was to commission a study to examine the pros and cons of a nunavut capital commission .
mr. speaker , i have forwarded copies of the report to the mayor and council of iqaluit as well as to member tootoo and premier paul okalik .
an advance copy was also provided to the minister for community government , the honourable jack anawak .
this was a report commissioned for me as the mla for iqaluit east and mr. speaker , it has not been formally endorsed by the nunavut government .
most provincial , territorial and international capitals have a capital commission in place to help the locally elected body deal with development and planning issues .
the nunavut capital commission would function in a parallel fashion to these other similar commissions , but would also be flexible to deal with the different aspects of a northern capital .
it would also have representatives , mr. speaker , from other nunavut communities appointed as commissioners .
the designation of iqaluit as capital of nunavut is a result of a vigorous territorial campaign and plebiscite in 1995 .
the capital commission report , if adopted , would follow up on that commitment and that promise .
mr. speaker , some of the exciting recommendations of the report include a proposal to set aside a reserve of 200 acres of land for the future legislative assembly and a possible museum site .
this follows along with the seat of government in the west where yellowknife has designated the area near frame lake as the capital site .
it contains walking trails , benches , open spaces and interpretative displays .
the two hundred acre proposed iqaluit reserve runs parallel to the apex road and takes in the historic apex beach area and the old hbc buildings .
mr. speaker i think that the capital commission report is proactive and it is an idea whose time has come .
i now await the recommendations of the iqaluit town council on their review of this report .
later today i will table the report in this house so that it will be made available to the public in both english and inuktitut .

when we started setting up the hamlet council in uqsuqtuq he was elected .
he is still a member of different boards and agencies in our home community .
i think he knows all the inside workings of uqsuqtuq .
i grew up without a father and he was the one who taught me the traditional skills of hunting .
i know he &apos;s very capable and i haven &apos;t learned as much as i can yet .
i would like him to be recognized and i believe he &apos;s very well respected not only in uqsuqtuq but all the nunavut communities .

oral questions
question 01 - 1 ( 3 ) :
outboard motor propellers
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i have a question for the minister of transportation .
i have been a hunter from the time that i was a child .
with the outboard motors that we use today the propellers are sold separately .
i believe that outboard motors or any equipment should come whole because it &apos;s very hard to buy parts in our communities .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. anawak , if you &apos;d like to respond , you could do so .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
yes , we could write a letter to the retail outlets and to the manufacturers , but they &apos;re the ones who manufacture this equipment .
we could only urge the retail outlets to meet the needs of the consumer .

mr. speaker my question is for the minister responsible for public works , telecommunications and technical services and i believe , housing .
i would just like to ask the minister if she could indicate the difference between a public tender and a request for proposals .
i just wonder if i could get an explanation of the difference .

question 03 - 1 ( 3 ) :
terms of reference for task force on housing
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is directed to the minister responsible for housing for nunavut .
can the minister explain in more detail as to what direction she has given the task force .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister of housing , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson :
thank you , mr. speaker .
there are a lot of issues in housing that have to be addressed and they require policy changes , for example the rent scale and to address the overcrowding situation in nunavut .
the task force will be getting together and that &apos;s their first step , to come up with their terms of reference .
my direction to the task force is that i want a report of their recommendations the first week of december for the urgent needs of social housing and also another report in march .
the task force will come up with their terms of reference .
we have a problem with social housing , housing shortages , overcrowding , rent scales .
i think this government is quite aware that we need to do something in housing and that &apos;s why we are doing something to solve this problem .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you ms. thompson .
oral questions .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , the standing committee on housing made a number of recommendations for the immediate and long term , regarding the crisis that we have with housing in nunavut .
i find it somewhat difficult to comprehend that we have a standing committee that &apos;s been elected by the members of this house who are elected by the people of nunavut .
when they come forth with recommendations as to some immediate and long term solutions , why were these recommendations not passed on to the task force .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister responsible for housing , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson :

hon. manitok thompson :
thank you , mr. speaker .
this is not a secretive task force , i &apos;m trying to involve everybody .

in june , cabinet had a meeting in apex .
one of the topics was decentralization .
could the minister responsible explain to me why this happened .
ma &apos;na .
speaker :
mr. mclean , just before you respond , i &apos;d like to remind the members again you have to have a preamble and four questions after that .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you , mr. speaker .
it is beyond our control as i stated before .
there are some health positions that we could not locate in baker lake .
accordingly , i undertook along with my cabinet colleagues , to review any upcoming institutions and provide baker lake with an opportunity to take on those opportunities .

mr. akesuk :
nakurmiik uqaqtii .
i have a question for the minister of health and social services .
when we were in our second session i asked a question to the minister of health and social services .
i haven &apos;t had a response to date in regards to the shortage of social workers in kimmirut .
it &apos;s been nine months now since we &apos;ve had our shortage .
can you give me an update on what &apos;s happening with the issue of a social worker in kimmirut .
speaker :
minister responsible for health and social services , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , the member has been very proactive in his lobbying efforts on behalf of the community of kimmirut .
the problem that we have with staffing in the community is the lack of housing .
i think this is going to be addressed over the coming weeks and then moved forward in putting a person in that position .

question 06 - 1 ( 3 ) :
mental health worker for arviat
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , this weekend past in my community , unfortunately there was a young lady that tragically lost her life , a 21 year old lady that committed suicide .
mr. speaker , my question to the minister is ; at this point in time what is the status of having a full time mental health care worker in the community of arviat .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister responsible for health and social services .
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , first of all i should say i send my condolences along with this house to the people of arviat on your loss .
that &apos;s what the nunavut government is trying to do .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
oral questions .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker , mr. speaker , i beg to differ with the minister .
i believe i did , i stand to be corrected , i did bring up this issue some time ago before we were placed in our new home here .
can the minister tell me whether or not there is a mental health specialist located in arviat as of this date .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister of health and social services , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
mr. speaker i don &apos;t have an org. chart with me or a staffing list to tell me if there &apos;s a mental health specialist per se in the community of arviat .
we have 26 communities in nunavut .
like we have done in other communities in nunavut .
in some cases for example , when we have a shortage of nurses , what we try to do is identify what nursing positions are needed in the community .
in some cases it may be a psychiatric nurse as opposed to a general practitioner , per se .
those types of proactive solutions can be found at the community level .
so , if a specific request comes forward , then we can look at it .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
third supplementary .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i remember many many times , my colleagues speaking of the need for suicide prevention and professionals in the field to help guide individuals that are troubled .
so this isn &apos;t new , this is an old story .
i find it difficult to believe that the minister is not aware that each community should have a mental health specialist .
this is not a new topic , it &apos;s been around for a long time .
i think that the minister should make it his business to find out whether each community has a mental health worker .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister of health and social services , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
and i take the role very responsibly and seriously and i don &apos;t like the indication that i &apos;m not taking it seriously .
i gave the example where in another community there was a request for a nurse .
it wasn &apos;t just a request for a nurse , we put in a psychiatric nurse .
but we &apos;ve got to find those professionals .

question 07 - 1 ( 3 ) :
task force on housing issues
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question is for the minister responsible for housing .
in her minister &apos;s statement she indicated that she &apos;s formed a task force , which i think is good .
we need to develop a task force and she indicated that the mandate of the task force was to find solutions to the housing problems in nunavut .
my question to the minister is , does the department not have that information available at this time .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister responsible for housing , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson :
qujannamiik uqaqti .
( interpretation ) i would also like to thank the member for iqaluit centre , as he &apos;s one of the members who will be sitting on the task force on housing .
i &apos;m pleased to make that announcement .
i believe we all know this and i also made statements on radio and tv .
the numbers that were given to us are not quite accurate in regards to the number of people that are on the waiting list .
there are a lot of people out there who took their names out and therefore we don &apos;t have a true representation of the people who are on the waiting list for housing .
there &apos;s an overcrowding situation , there are three or four nuclear families living under one roof and there are some young people who are still living with their parents .
so they should qualify to live in their own housing .
we have to create a task force and i would like to have a close working relationship with them and also members and housing staff to find some solutions .
they &apos;re compiling new numbers that are more reflective of the real housing shortage out there .
there are 26 communities in the nunavut area and i believe that we have to treat every one equal .
we can &apos;t know exactly where these houses are going to be built with numbers that aren &apos;t accurate .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you , mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , the minister indicated that new numbers are being compiled and i &apos;m just wondering if she has any indication of when that information will be ready to be reviewed .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister responsible for housing , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson :
thank you , mr. speaker , the new numbers are going to be ready pretty soon .
i can &apos;t tell you the exact date of when they &apos;ll be ready but they will be available very soon .
speaker :
thank you ms. thompson .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , the old numbers that were used that weren &apos;t accurate , i believe were from the 1996 needs survey .
i &apos;d just like to ask the minister why some of these things weren &apos;t addressed earlier on instead of waiting until now to be looked at .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister responsible for housing , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :

in regards to the jobs that were going to cape dorset , have these been changed .

i &apos;ll direct that to the premier .

hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
we will just go ahead with our decentralization planning .

second supplementary , mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you again mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , we &apos;ve talked about the needs and the critical situation we have with housing .
would the minister be able to commit that if there is a surplus , i know this may come across as hypothetical , but we &apos;re assuming that there is .
will some of these funds be put towards the housing crisis ?
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister of finance , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , it isn &apos;t hypothetical , we know there are some unexpended funds within the departments and government as a whole .
i can &apos;t commit to anything right now .
it has to go out to the financial management board , any recommendations on wherever excess funds would be expended .
i think one has to recognize that we have some issues to deal with .
specifically the health board situation and their financial status as that stands now .
there are some over expenditures in the information technology work that &apos;s being undertaken by this government .
we have the collective agreement process under way right now with federation of nunavut teachers that may have some financial implications .

mr. speaker , over the last several months , quite a few day cares in our region have been experiencing financial difficulty .
the government of nunavut has earmarked 1.4 million for day care for all of nunavut .
there &apos;s millions of dollars in third party funding out there that sometimes is very hard for these organizations to access .
we all know that day care is a very important issue in nunavut and we have a large number of young kids that attend these day cares .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
two questions , minister responsible for day cares .
mr. arvaluk . oh , sorry , there are two questions in there and i think there &apos;s two departments that are involved here .
minister of health and minister of education .
mr. arvaluk , would you like to respond to the question ?
hon. james arvaluk :
mr. speaker is the question are we talking with our federal counterparts in respect to increasing day-care funding .
is that what the question is ?
speaker :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
i will allow you to ask the question again mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na uqaqti .
i &apos;ll try to rephrase the question , i &apos;m sorry i confused the minister .
yes mr. minister , are you negotiating any increase from your federal counterparts to increase day care funding for nunavut .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
minister of education , mr. arvaluk
hon. james arvaluk :
mr. speaker , i think if i add some preamble to this it will be clearer .
that in turn is a good investment so we will continue to relay that message .
but i &apos;d like to add to the question that is how and when , how fast we &apos;ll be able to get that , i don &apos;t know yet .
speaker :
qujannamiik mr. arvaluk .
oral questions .
oral questions .
mr. tootoo .
question 13 - 1 ( 3 ) :
status of new hospital for iqaluit
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker i believe that my question is going to be directed to the minister of finance who is responsible for p3 projects .
i &apos;d like to ask the minister if he could provide me with the status of the new hospital project here in iqaluit .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of finance , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
as it stands now we &apos;re waiting for the final report from the consultant , and i believe it is due in the middle of next week .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
more questions mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
it was at that time supposed to be provided within 30 days .
thank you , mr. speaker
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of finance .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
your third supplementary mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the minister indicated that there was some confusion over whose responsibility it was to undertake the task to do the functional review of the department .
at the time , last spring in the last session , it was indicated that it was going to be the responsibility of the department of health and social services .
and now i guess i &apos;m finding out that it &apos;s the department of finance that &apos;s doing that functional review .
i just wanted to ask for some clarification as to what caused that confusion and what finally resulted . thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
finance minister mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
so they asked the department of finance to undertake that on their behalf .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
more questions ?
mr. puqiqnak .
question 14 - 1 ( 3 ) :
construction behind schedule in gjoa haven
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question will be directed to the public works minister .
in my community the contractors under the department of public works are way behind .
mr. speaker i have written the appropriate minister for that and i would like to know what your position is in regards to my constituency .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
public works minister thompson .
ms. thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
which letter are you referring to ?
are we talking about the money ?
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. thompson .
i &apos;ll let that question go ahead .
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
the uqsuqtuq development corporation , i believe the money comes in from the department of public works and it takes a long time to reach our community .
could you give us an update on what &apos;s happening ?
the reason why i &apos;m asking this question is it takes a long time for the money to come into the development corporation .
ms. thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you for the clarification .
this is in reference to a letter that was written by the member to myself .
this is also being dealt with by different departments .
we gave this request to the department of finance and asked them why it takes a long time for the money to come in to the communities .
i &apos;m still waiting for a response from the department of finance and i &apos;ll inform the member once i receive that response .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. thompson .
supplementary question mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to ask the nunavut government to be expedient in sending money to the communities so that the businesses will be more viable .
i also know , because of the long wait for their money , some of their employees are moving onto other jobs , because they haven &apos;t been paid for a long time .
i would like to urge the government departments to be more expedient in sending out money to the communities .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
i don &apos;t hear a question but if you would like to make a response ms. thompson .
ms. thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
that was a very clear outline of the concerns in the communities and we hope to see a better , smoother operation .
i &apos;ll work on his responses as soon as i can and i &apos;ll inform the member .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. thompson .
more questions mr. o &apos;brien .
question 15 - 1 ( 3 ) :
status of the three hospitals
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question is to follow up on some questions asked earlier by my colleague in reference to the hospitals , the three hospitals that are being planned for nunavut .
mr. speaker , i don &apos;t want to throw cold water on this but i need some clarification here .
am i to understand that these three hospitals are approved to be constructed ?
and the question would be to mr. ng .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister of finance , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , as you know the government of nunavut has accepted in principle the concept of p3 and supported that concept in trying to finance some of our facility needs .
if there are some deficiencies , what steps to take next , or if it &apos;s recommended to go forward .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng , minister of finance .
another question mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , can the minister tell me who is picking up the cost for all this planning and design work .
i understand just from an article in the paper yesterday that the design work for these facilities is already completed and there was an article in the newspaper about it .
who is actually paying for this ?
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister of finance , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
so , that &apos;s the work that &apos;s been undertaken to date .
at that time , as i indicated , there &apos;ll be decisions made through the financial management board on what avenues to pursue to make these projects proceed or not to proceed .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
third supplementary , mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
thank you minister for that clarification .
the question to the minister would be , once this work is completed will it go through and be passed with the standing committee on health for review ?
the second point , the functional review that you are speaking of and the preliminary design , will this work come through the standing committee on health so they can review this ?
and this functional review does it take into account the difficulty in trying to recruit nurses and doctors and specialists to nunavut .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
two questions , final questions , minister of finance , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , if a decision is made we would undertake consultations with the appropriate committees .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
oral questions , mr. mclean .
question 16 - 1 ( 3 ) :
mineral accord
mr. mclean :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is to the minister responsible for the mineral accord .
as we know , mining is on a bubble right now in nunavut .
in the throne speech it said things in regards to having to attain self-reliance and self-sufficiency .
to this date i don &apos;t know where this government stands with the mineral accord .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
minister responsible for sustainable development , sorry , i think this is deferred to minister of finance , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
that &apos;s what happens when you answer one question , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , we have done just very preliminary discussions at the officials level and at the political level .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
oral questions , mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you , mr. speaker .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
minister of finance , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
but certainly it would be the goal of this government as soon as possible and before the end of our mandate .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you , mr. speaker .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
i didn &apos;t hear a question .
mr. ng if you would like to respond .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i appreciate the comments and the advice from the honourable member and i would think that once the current mandate of the liberal government expires that it would be renewed to have another mandate .
thank you , mr. speaker .
&gt; &gt; laughter and applause
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
more questions ?
mr. o &apos;brien .
question 17 - 1 ( 3 ) :
staffing for medical facilities
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr speaker .
mr. speaker this is a question that was posed by mr. ng for mr. picco .
my question is directed to the minister of health .
i ask that question in relationship to the fact that we have so much difficulty in even recruiting nurses and keeping them and also social services workers .
have you been involved with discussions in reference to this particular issue ?
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
before i ask mr. picco to respond , i would like to advise the members not to mention the names of the ministers .
it has to go through the speaker .
mr. picco , minister of health .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker that was a good ruling .
mr. speaker , no we haven &apos;t looked at the actual staffing needs because the program functional review hasn &apos;t been completed .
as mr. ng stated earlier , the program functional review will look at what programs and services will be delivered out of the buildings .
after that is done then you can look at the staffing complement that would suit that building or that piece of infrastructure that we &apos;ll have on the ground .
so , mr. speaker i guess the short answer is no we haven &apos;t reviewed it because the program functional review hasn &apos;t been completed .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
more questions . second supplementary mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question is again directed to the minister responsible for health .
given our past experience in recruiting and maintaining our medical staff , does the minister anticipate any problem in trying to recruit staff ?
for example , to operate the proposed new hospital for iqaluit .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister of health , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
please try and ask appropriate questions , you can try and ask questions that relate to the scenario .
no other questions .
if you would like to ask your final question mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question of course , again , is for the minister responsible for health .
you spoke of the hospital in iqaluit being four or five years down the road , assuming that it is approved and funded .
what is the timing on the smaller centres that are being proposed , the smaller hospitals .
and if the minister could address the problem with the recruitment and retention of staff .
if these potential hospitals are only a year or so down the road or is that too far into the future for the minister to try and predict .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister responsible for health , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i heard two questions in there , no , three was it , and i &apos;m more than happy to try and answer those questions .
so , how can i hypothetically say if it &apos;s going to be a problem to staff something that hasn &apos;t even been approved or constructed or is even in place ?
so , i tried explaining that .
two , on recruitment and retention mr. speaker , i &apos;d love to sit here and answer questions on recruitment and retention .
the nunavut employee &apos;s union is moving towards a collective agreement process with our government now that may address some of the concerns that we have in salaries and salary dollars .
if the member would allow , later on this afternoon with the full caucus , in the briefing on health and social services we could get into more detail on recruitment and retention issues .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
i would like to make another ruling .
the second time mr. o &apos;brien , you asked two questions on your final supplementary .
in respect to your colleagues , i would like to keep the rules of the house in order and i will not allow five questions in our next sitting .

ministers &apos; statements
minister &apos;s statement 06 - 1 ( 3 ) :
overview of health and social services initiatives
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i appreciated the opportunity to brief the full caucus about some important issues facing the department of health &amp; social services .
during this session , i want to expand on that briefing by updating you and the house on more of the exciting and sometimes difficult initiatives that are underway in my department .
as you know , we have been very busy over the past six months implementing the decision to integrate the regional health boards into one department .
since april the department has been holding regular integration meetings and conference calls with senior staff from the regional boards .
i am pleased to tell you that we are making significant progress , which i will explain in more detail in later statements .
i also want to reinforce this government &apos;s commitment to a &quot; no layoff &quot; policy for those employees affected by integration .
with that in mind , mr. speaker , i would like to publicly thank :
sharon ehaloak , chairperson of the kitikmeot regional health &amp; social services board and their ceo , miss alice isnor ;
rosie oolooyuk , chairperson of the keewatin board and ceo keith best ;
and dennis patterson , chairperson of the baffin board and ceo jarvis hoult .
mr. speaker , although the integration of the health boards is a major task unto itself , we have also been moving forward on other important issues .
with the support of this house , we were able to create the first nunavut nursing program at arctic college .
last week , the hon. james arvaluk and i were able to meet these students to congratulate them and wish them the very best in their studies .
the road ahead for these students is a challenging one .
it will take commitment , perseverance , hard work and probably some sleepless nights .
they will need the support of their friends , families and communities .
but they are a part of our future - they have risen to the challenge and will make nunavut proud .
educating our own nurses is just one part of a comprehensive recruitment and retention strategy that we are developing .
we are also in the process of hiring a nunavut workforce development officer within the department who will be mainly responsible for working on recruitment and retention issues .
it is expected that more recruitment and retention initiatives will be announced over the coming weeks .
arviat &apos;s health centre will begin construction in earnest this spring .
i also want to tell you a little about our plans for the future delivery of heath care in nunavut .
our goal is to shift the emphasis of programs and policies to community based delivery and preventative care , mr. speaker , preventative care .
an approach that goes hand-in-hand with community empowerment .
we are also seeking creative ways to improve access to health care and social services in the communities through initiatives such as telehealth .
this is a promising tool for nunavut and i would like to thank the members for attending the recent demonstration that i held to show you this technology .
i will be telling you more about this initiative later this session .
as publicly announced recently , the three health boards had a combined deficit of approximately $ 8.9 million dollars as of march 31 , 1999 .
i want to reassure the people of nunavut that service delivery will not be compromised by these deficits .
of course , the other ingredient that is essential for success is the input and participation of all residents of nunavut .
it is with this in mind that i have visited and met with health centre staff and hamlet councils in many nunavut communities .
over the coming months i plan to hold more meetings and to attend regional forums where possible .

inuit rcmp graduates
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
because i can only say thank you in inuktitut .
i am pleased to announce to the legislature that the first all-inuit troop of recruits has completed training in regina .
we now have six highly trained inuit rcmp officers who have returned to nunavut and are assigned to various communities throughout the territory .
the inuit officers are :
joe baines from iqaluit , assigned to arviat ;
pitseolak koochiakjuk from iqaluit , assigned to cambridge bay ;
eric ootoovak from pond inlet , assigned to iqaluit , kevin sudlovenick from pond inlet , assigned to rankin inlet ;
richard tatty from arviat , assigned to iqaluit ;
ben williams from iqaluit , assigned to rankin inlet .
this is the first time that we have had a full troop of inuit recruits trained to become officers .
this is an extremely important event for our communities and for nunavut as a whole .
inuit officers who can speak the inuktitut language and who understand the people will have a major impact on justice in the communities .
and hopefully , these officers will serve as role models for young people throughout nunavut .
i believe that this is inuit qaujimajatuqangit at work .
i want to recognize and thank chief superintendent chris bothe of &quot; v &quot; division for his vision and his efforts in making this initiative a reality .
but , most important , i want to congratulate our new inuit rcmp officers for their courage , their hard work , and their dedication to the people of nunavut .
they will face challenges as they assume their new roles , but they will have the support and encouragement of this legislature and the people of nunavut throughout their careers .
thank you , mr. speaker .

an education act for nunavut
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i would like to make an announcement on an education act for nunavut .
mr. speaker , i am pleased to announce an initiative that will impact on the development of education in nunavut for many years to come .
as you remember , a decision was made during the last session to dissolve the divisional education councils .
this decision means that we must revise the existing education act to reflect the new roles and responsibilities of the various partners involved with the education of our children .
it will also allow us the opportunity to revise the act to make it more reflective of nunavut .
i am pleased to report that we are receiving comments back from this exercise .
the suggestions we receive will allow for further development of an education act for all of nunavut .
it is important that those involved in the education of our children take an active role in the revision of the education act .
it is through the active involvement of parents , dea &apos;s , community members and educators that we will develop an education system that is meaningful , responsive and reflective of nunavut .
( interpretation ) mr. speaker , we will be bringing the revisions of the education act forward at a future time .
i will be keeping the members informed as to our progress .
thank you , mr. speaker .

minister &apos;s statement 09 - 1 ( 3 ) :
sport nunavut division
hon. jack anawak :
thank you , mr. speaker .
sport nunavut division , a division of community government and transportation , promotes , develops and delivers sport in nunavut .
before the creation of nunavut , sport was funded and delivered through the independent nwt organization , sport north .
sport nunavut is now funded through government sources , so it became a division of community government and transportation .
sport nunavut headquarters is located in baker lake with four staff members , a director , two sport development officers and one support staff .
even though sport and recreation programs are organized and funded through various levels of government , the delivery of programs is often at the community level through countless volunteer hours .
sport nunavut has three main goals in its first year of operation .
the second goal is to ensure a level of proficiency for all sport volunteers involved with the delivery of sport programs in nunavut .
sport nunavut &apos;s coaching / officiating strategy will target the severe lack of certified coaches and officials in nunavut .
over the next few months sport nunavut , working with the coaching association of canada , will host several clinics specifically requested by communities and sport associations .
our third goal is to provide the leadership role in the development of a representative team from nunavut at the arctic winter games 2000 in whitehorse .
nunavut will have representatives competing in twelve sports .
for many of our youth , the arctic winter games and the regional and territorial trials leading to the games , provide an opportunity to share in sport and spirit .
team nunavut will be comprised not only of athletes , but also coaches , officials , volunteers and a cultural delegation .
sport nunavut has been fortunate to recruit numerous volunteers who have joined together to help build healthy communities in nunavut .
the recruitment , training and recognition of these volunteers are an essential component of the sporting community and far too often their contributions are overlooked .
as i stand in this house today as the minister responsible for sports , i would like to publicly thank these individuals .
i would also like to ask my fellow members to recognize the time , energy and dedication of these individuals in our communities .
i also would like to take this opportunity to welcome the sport nunavut division staff in baker lake : patrick tagoona , director ;
tommy bruce and jeffrey seeteenak , sport development officers ; and marianne uqayuittuq , divisional secretary .

compensation for losses at floe edge
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i rise today representing the people of pond inlet , my constituency . i think it was in 1997 that some students went out on a land program in lancaster sound .
they were stuck on a floe edge , on a piece of ice for three days and i am very pleased to announce that nobody was fatally hurt or harmed .
they had to be picked up by a helicopter on an emergency basis .
they have never been paid to date and i would like to give a written document to the minister of education today .

recognition of search and rescue team
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
today i rise to recognize and acknowledge my community &apos;s search and rescue team and all the people who take part when we have to search for hunters .
when this happens they have to work very hard to try and do their fund raising for search and rescue efforts .
some of these search and rescue teams are not even supported financially by the government and they have to do their own fund raising .
i know that this is the case in all the communities of nunavut .
search and rescue is very important and critical to nunavut .
i know that people who are involved in search and rescue teams would like to work on educating people on how to survive from the bottom of their heart .
they all work hard night and day , regardless of whether there is a blizzard outside , they do their searching .
therefore i would like to acknowledge all the people who do search and rescue .
mr. speaker , i would like to acknowledge our government for giving financial support when we need this for search and rescue .
i will be giving a written document in regards to this issue to the appropriate minister .
thank you , mr. speaker .

year of the elder person
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na , uqaqti .
this morning the members of the legislative assembly had the honour of having a meeting with the elders of nunavut to hear their concerns .
uqaqti , 1999 is the year of the elder person .
traditions and knowledge from the land are rarely passed on now to the younger generation by experience .
this in itself has been an impetus for numerous efforts to keep these things alive .
in the past august , 200 elders from across nunavut and nunavik gathered in iqaluit to share with each other and members of the community , traditional songs and dances , customs and practices .
uqaqti , let us not forget that this is the year of the elder and try to listen to them more often .

changes to justice system
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
this morning i rise for my member &apos;s statement in reference to the justice system .
the justice system has to be amended for the inuit and nunavut residents &apos; lifestyle .
other aboriginal groups , for example the navajo indians , have their own justice system .
we have to utilize our traditions and culture within the nunavut justice system .
the justice system within nunavut is very important and should reflect our culture .
mr. speaker , thank you .

education a priority
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i rise again today to talk about one of the key issues that the government has identified as a priority and that is education .
education is vital to our future .
i think this is especially true in the primary and pre-school area .
it is during these first crucial years that the skills are developed that will help our young children throughout the rest of their educational lives and employment for the rest of their lives .
i think it is very important that these areas are identified and funded adequately .
i think our education system has to ensure that we give these young people the tools they need to do the jobs we are going to want them to do in the future .
i just wanted to commend the government for making that one of their priorities and i look forward to asking the minister some questions during this session .

importance of elders
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i know that we touched upon the issue of elders but we realize that we need more support and we have to consult more with the elders .
as they are becoming fewer and fewer we have to use the elders during the initial stages of our nunavut government .
the elders are not going to approach us , it is going to be up to us to take the initiative and see our elders and to ask them questions .
that way there will be a closer working relationship between the elders , they &apos;ll feel that they are being effective .
we have to be proud of our elders , we shouldn &apos;t be intimidated by them .
they are just waiting for us to ask questions .
i would like to urge the representatives of the nunavut government to use the elders more .
thank you , mr. speaker .

thank you , mr. speaker .
i rise today to speak about our youth and elders .
they are looking for ways that they can have a close working relationship .
our elders are dying off with their wise knowledge and our young people are our future .
we have to train our young people properly for the future so that they can start thinking on their own , start believing in themselves , knowing that they are very capable people .
so that is the power of young people , through education it can happen .

oral questions
question 18 - 1 ( 3 ) :
inuit customs in the justice system
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to direct this question to the minister of justice .
ever since april 1st , when the nunavut government was established , we have been saying we would be using inuit traditions and culture within the justice system .
that &apos;s our goal .
my question to the appropriate minister is , are we going to be utilizing inuit culture within the justice system in nunavut .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
since april 1st , the department of justice has been consolidated into one .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to thank the minister for his response .
another question , i think it was last spring that i asked this question to find out your progress with the baffin correctional centre .
last spring i spoke about bcc .
the inmates at the baffin correctional centre need help with their social problems .
they should be provided with more healing programs .
my question to the minister is if you provide healing programs to the inmates at bcc .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kattuk .
i would like to remind each and every one of you the rule on oral questions .
during oral questions you have to ask about only one topic .
you have already asked your question about the department of justice , but your second question is in regards to the baffin correctional centre .
i would like to remind you that you can only ask one question with one topic .
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
but at this time , we have not set up any programs .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. iqaqrialu .
question 19 - 1 ( 3 ) :
airline schedules
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i don &apos;t know if my question can be responded to , but it is to the minister of transportation .
in my constituency of clyde river and qikiqtarjuaq , these two communities are very close to each other .
when the weather is bad the passengers going to qikiqtarjuaq or clyde river have to wait a whole week if they can &apos;t get to their community due to bad weather .
if the weather is bad again , they have to wait another week . therefore sometimes the passengers will wait three weeks to get to qikiqtarjuaq or clyde river .
this is inappropriate and especially when a loved one dies , some family members can &apos;t reach their destination .
i don &apos;t know which airline schedules should be fixed or changed , but i am asking this question to the minister responsible for transportation to see if they can rectify this situation .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
our department can &apos;t tell the airlines what to do but we are now finding out all of these concerns .
in regards to your statement we can write a letter to convey your concern to the airline .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you . mr. alakannuark .
question 20 - 1 ( 3 ) :
cost of merchandise
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is directed to the minister of transportation .
i know that all the goods and services at the stores are very expensive , for example our daily goods that we have to buy .
could you do a review or study to find out how much these items cost , or how expensive these are because some young families cannot even afford to buy their staples .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
i will direct your question to mr. anawak since he is responsible for that portfolio .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
we are very aware of the high cost of living in the nunavut settlement area .
i had a meeting with nav canada , when we took on the department of transportation , we had a meeting with them to see if they could further reduce the costs .
for example , giving reduced fares for goods and services , for freight .
we had a meeting with nav canada , and we talked about reducing the costs of freight and of course we also have to pay for landing fees .
we haven &apos;t set up any programs but we would like to review the cost of living through my department .
like i said , we haven &apos;t completed all the reviews that we would like to do and i cannot respond to your question right at this time .
speaker :
mr. tootoo .
question 21 - 1 ( 3 ) :
funding for classroom supplies
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker my question is for the minister responsible for education .
i would like to ask the minister responsible if the schools are funded for providing supplies necessary in the class rooms .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the funding is given to district education authorities from the regional education council on a per student basis .
the school receives o &amp; m funding on a per capita basis .
it is strictly up to the district education authorities how they spend that money .
what they buy with that money is not up to the department of education .
but i would like to tell the member that they are funded on a per capita basis and we have no direct control as to how they spend that .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to thank the minister for confirming how the funding is allocated to the schools .
paint , pencils and pens , anything besides furniture .
a class room in one of the schools here is allocated , based on the formula , 400 dollars a year to provide all of those materials necessary for the students in that class .
mr. speaker with an average class size of 25 students per class that works out , in order to provide those basic materials to each student , to 16 dollars per year .
i would like to ask the minister of education if he feels those are adequate resources in order to provide supplies to our young children in the class rooms .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you , mr. speaker , i will provide the member those details .
there are approximately , i can &apos;t even count how many schools there are in nunavut now , but lots .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
third supplementary mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo , you cannot ask for an opinion from the minister .
maybe you can rephrase your question .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
how can i rephrase it .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
mr. speaker , thank you .
i certainly could have told the member how i feel about this .
&gt; &gt; laughter
mr. speaker , the budget that is given to the department , the last figure that we had in the main estimates , is 133 million dollars .
that creates a pie and all of these allocations are given equally on a ratio basis , to district education councils , or divisional education councils .
that in turn , through a per capita formula system is given , as i said , to the schools .
from that , once we are given a budget from this assembly , through the main estimates , we really don &apos;t have much of a role to play in it .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .

oral questions , mr. nutarak .
question 22 - 1 ( 3 ) :
administrative support for elders societies
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i have a question for the minister of culture , language , elders &amp; youth .
there are elders &apos; societies established in our communities and we have one in our community .
they don &apos;t have employees or support services .
they don &apos;t have secretaries to handle their administrative matters .
my question to the minister is if he could look into providing positions for these so that the elders &apos; societies can have administrative support services .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
minister of culture , language , elders &amp; youth , mr. havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker . i could not hear him .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. nutarak had a question regarding administrative support for the elders .
mr. havioyak was going to respond as the minister of culture , language , elders &amp; youth .
we had technical difficulties .
at this point we will give mr. havioyak an opportunity to respond to mr. nutarak &apos;s question .
mr. havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
sorry , we were cut off .
thank you very much mr. speaker .
i just want you to recognize that the person who was going to be assisting me with elders has not yet been hired .
i will confirm with you who will be assisting me when the hiring is done .
right now it is not confirmed and this will be looked at , at a later date at which time i will confirm .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. havioyak .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i have another question for mr. havioyak .
when we had our meeting in april , i asked this same question regarding the larger communities with larger populations .
my comment in april was that if we had a full time position for the elders societies it would cost too much .
so i made the suggestion that perhaps the larger communities elders &apos; societies could get a secretarial support position on a half time basis .
that was just in relation to the larger communities where they have elders &apos; societies and if it &apos;s possible to get a half time position to give administrative support for these societies .
the reason i am saying this is that we need to retain the elders knowledge and to have everything written down so that we don &apos;t forget our culture and our language .
so my question again is would you be able to give us half time positions for the elders societies in the larger communities .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
minister for culture , language , elders &amp; youth , mr. havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak :
thank you , mr. speaker .
again i want to point out that the senior advisor for the elders is still not hired today but will be hired very shortly now .
that &apos;s one of the options that will be looked at by the staff .
thank you .

question 24 - 1 ( 3 ) :
oil tank upgrade project
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is for the minister of public works , ms. thompson .
when we were in our budget session it was agreed for my constituency that there would be some renovations done on our oil tanks .
i was told that this was not going to go ahead any more because there was no funding available for these renovations .
could you give me an update on what is happening .
speaker :

hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :

i know that we have to come up with a better term in inuktitut , but our department is called sanajilirijimi , department of public works .
the member for sanikiluaq informed me about his concerns on this issue and the member is also very busy dealing with other concerns .
so that is the information that i can give you , that we will have funding for april 2000 .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you ms. thompson .
mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
perhaps i will rephrase my question .
thank you ms. thompson for your response , but i would like to ask if the oil tanks were filled to capacity .
i was wondering if we are going to have an adequate fuel supply prior to april .
if the oil tanks are not filled to capacity will we have a sufficient fuel supply for the winter .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kattuk .
minister responsible for public works , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
if there is an insufficient fuel supply , we will rectify the problem but at this point in time i have not heard about sanikiluaq being supplied with insufficient fuel .
i don &apos;t know if it will be sufficient for the winter but if that has happened we will rectify the situation when we experience it .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. thompson .
mr. o &apos;brien .
question 25 - 1 ( 3 ) : elders living below poverty line
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker my question is directed to the minister responsible for culture , language , elders &amp; youth , for elders in particular .
mr. speaker through the course of the morning we spoke with the elders and then had some comments made about the importance of elders .
to my mind mr. speaker , we seem to always be looking to the elders for advice and looking to the elders in general .
mr. speaker my question to the minister in this regard is , does the minister have any idea as to how many elders may be living below the poverty line in nunavut .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister responsible for culture , language , elders &amp; youth , mr. havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker , and i thank the member for his question .
at this time we are looking into this and i want to reply to your question accurately .
i will keep this in mind and i will get back to you on that .
speaker :
he is not aware how many people are on the poverty line at this time until research is done .
i think that is a hypothetical question mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i made an assumption that there may be some statistics on this particular issue .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
yes , i will look into this and get back to you again .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. puqiqnak .
question 26 - 1 ( 3 ) :
lack of job opportunities for youth
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i am not too sure to whom i should be directing this question , but perhaps to the community government minister .
in taloyoak we met with the organizations in the community .
i think they are called interagency committees , they had a concern , and it &apos;s a fact i believe , that the children have no place to go after school .
i was wondering if the minister for community government and transportation has any plans .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
i appreciate your question and i think in most of the communities we have discussed the lack of employment for young people or for young students .
if our young children had things to do and if they lived a healthier lifestyle , they would be better educated .
( interpretation ends ) i &apos;ll take it as notice mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak , the question is taken as notice .
oral questions , mr. nutarak .
question 27 - 1 ( 3 ) :
education act review
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to direct this question to the minister of education .
when mr. arvaluk was making his statement , he said they would be working on the education act and he would table that some time in the future .
i know the education act will have to be amended to reflect nunavut .
how do you see proceeding with the review of the act .
will you be involving the communities , how are you going to be working on the amendment of the act ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
minster responsible for education .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
as i stated before , we are now starting to consult with the communities and are receiving their input .
now we will start drafting the act in inuktitut first .
we will continue to consult with the communities and the members of the legislative assembly on the drafting of the bill in inuktitut .
if we read it for the second time it will be up to the members of the legislative assembly how they want to deal with the bill .
so once we give it to the standing committee it will be at their discretion whether they want to consult with the communities .
after it is read for the second time it will be up to your discretion how long you want to work on this amendment .
there was a bill passed that the regional boards of education will be dissolved .
if we can have the education bill read for the third time in the spring session we will be able to implement and it will reflect nunavut &apos;s needs .
it will be up to the cabinet when the third reading will happen .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
oral questions , mr. tootoo .
question 28 - 1 ( 3 ) :
changes to school funding
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
this question is directed to the minister of education .
my colleague just discussed the reform of the education act .
i would like to ask the minister if through this reform process the way the schools are funded would also be looked at .
i know , as you indicated earlier , that it is all on formula funding and it switched to that from program funding as we were having all kinds of problems with program funding .
so i would like to ask the minister if they will be looking at changes to how they are funded and not only the enactment .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
mr. speaker , naturally .
so everything , all the responses we will be getting from the citizens of nunavut , will be considered in the rewriting of the education act .
speaker :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
oral questions , mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i just wanted to ask for a clarification from the minister . the way that the schools are funded , is that something that is stipulated in the act .
that it be formula funded or program funded , is that something that is stipulated in the act ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
so i don &apos;t want to contemplate or stipulate any specific matter because i want to be completely open on this consultation process and that will be the basis of it .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker then i guess what i am hearing is that the minister is committing that the public has some input into how the schools are funded .
in his letter that was sent out on the principals , it doesn &apos;t address that .
so i would like to ask if he would commit to informing the appropriate bodies for input on that exact thing .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
oral questions , mr. alakannuark .
question 29 - 1 ( 3 ) :
public housing repairs
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
my question is directed to the minister for housing .
when i went to visit my constituency last summer some of the houses had not been retrofitted .
there is one house with oil burner heating and i was wondering if your department can look into my constituency because they are still using the old system of heating .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
ms. thompson . hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
this is the very first time that i have heard about it .
i don &apos;t know whether it is in repulse bay or pelly bay .
could you elaborate on which community you are talking about so that i could direct my staff to look into this situation and find out what we can do to rectify the problem .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. thompson .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
in repulse bay their houses are not built adequately , they even seem to be unsafe to live in and that has to be rectified .
some of the houses are still using the old stove heating system and they only have one heater in the house and it seemed to be unsafe .
it is that heating stove , it is so old , i felt that it was unsafe .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
this is the very first time i have heard about this concern of repulse bay , but i will direct my staff to deal with this and i will keep you updated .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. thompson .
mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
thank you very much for your response .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
oral questions , mr. iqaqrialu .
question 30 - 1 ( 3 ) :
status of clyde river hamlet funding
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is directed to the community government minister .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister responsible for community government .
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
in regards to mr. iqaqrialu &apos;s question i know exactly where he is coming from .
one of our employees has been working on this issue for quite some time .
we have agreed that we will cost share a position with the hamlet council to hire a bookkeeper and i have had discussions with the sao in the community .
there have been ongoing discussions with the hamlet council and my department and i would suggest that i have a meeting with mr. iqaqrialu and also the mayor of clyde river .
i think that we will be able to meet and discuss this further .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i know that there have been ongoing discussions between your department and the hamlet .
i had a discussion with the sao , the hamlet council and the employees of the hamlet council .
in order to carry out proper operations i was told by the sao that they were contemplating cutting down their hours or their salary because of the deficit situation .
those are some of the options that we heard from your department .
if that is going to be the case it is going to create a problem for the people of clyde river and it is not a small problem .
we are going to have to deal with this issue and your department and your staff and the people of clyde river are going to have to have further discussions .
if you cut down on their wages or you cut down on their hours ...
speaker ( interpretation ) :
please sit down mr. mr. iqaqrialu .
during oral questions you can not talk about general issues , but you can direct your question to the appropriate minister if you like .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
i apologize , of course we all make mistakes once in a while and it doesn &apos;t intimidate me either because i learn from my mistakes .
my question , following the statements i made , are you going to be cutting back on the employee salaries or are you going to be cutting back on their hours ?
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
the union negotiates the wages of the employees .
the hamlet council , since they were established , get formula funding on a per capita basis .
the hamlets , if i can use an example , if they are thinking about cutting back on the wages of their employees , we can &apos;t do anything about it .
we haven &apos;t said that this is what we are going to be doing , but we have had discussions with the hamlet council and the appropriate member of the legislative assembly .
if they don &apos;t want cutbacks , then we would have to start dialogues again .
if this problem cannot be rectified by the employees , then we would meet with the member of the legislative assembly and the elected council of the clyde river hamlet .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
we have reached our hour .
if you would like to ask a further question mr. iqaqrialu , i will give you an opportunity at this time .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i have another question .
these are deficits that have accumulated from the 70 &apos;s , from the 80 &apos;s and the deficit has accumulated over the years and it is huge now .
it wasn &apos;t the local government &apos;s fault .
can we just forgive or write off the old deficit .
i believe that we have to have discussions of these issues .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
like i said the communities are funded on a per capita basis .
i would like to tell the member of the legislative assembly that very likely we will have to meet with the employees of the hamlet council and also the appropriate mla .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .

hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
speaker :
thank you mr. premier .
minister &apos;s statement 11 - 1 ( 3 ) :
maligarnik qimirrujiit
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i wish to inform the members and bring them up to date on the progress made on the establishment of maligarnik qimirrujiit , nunavut &apos;s law review commission .
later today , i will table the terms of reference for the commission .
all members of this assembly are committed to promoting inuit values , and i believe that maligarnik qimirrujiit reflects the commitment in a definitive and tangible way .
a way in which nunavummiut across the territory can recognize and relate to .
one of the premises of nunavut was that we would be able to make our law in areas that we have authority .
in order to do this , we have to review the laws that we have inherited .
maligarnik qimirrujiit has important work to accomplish and we have looked to the members of this assembly to assist us in identifying people to be appointed as commissioners .
i would like to thank them for bringing names forward before last friday &apos;s deadline .
the commissioners need not have formal legal training .
they need not speak english .
primarily , their work will be to identify nunavut laws that are inconsistent with the vision and goals of nunavummiut .
laws that are not in keeping with inuit qaujimajatuqangit .
the commissioners will be asked to identify those areas of law for review .
the goal of maligarnik qimirrujiit will be to encourage public discussion and to reflect the thoughts and feelings of nunavummiut in the recommendations made to the government .
thank you .

minister &apos;s statement 12 - 1 ( 3 ) :
legal interpreter and justice of the peace training
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
i apologize .
thank you , mr. speaker .
i wish to inform members of two important initiatives being organized and sponsored by the nunavut department of justice .
the first is the legal interpreters training program currently underway at arctic college , the second is the justice of the peace training program which will start in iqaluit in november .
( interpretation ends ) the nunavut court of justice was officially created on april 1 .
this is a court that is unique in canada as it is the country &apos;s first single level trial court .
we decided on this model because it is the best for the people of nunavut .
but we continue to face challenges simply due to the make up of our territory .
we need high quality interpretation in the court room in order for the new court to serve the people effectively .
unfortunately , the few interpreters that we have in the communities have been under trained and are working under stressful conditions .
we need more qualified interpreters throughout nunavut .
therefore , my department has asked arctic college to select 17 applicants to take an intensive 8 week training program designed specifically for nunavut legal interpreters .
once these people graduate , they will return to their home communities and serve as interpreters for the nunavut court of justice .
( interpretation ) the second training program which will start in november is being designed and run by our justice of the peace co-ordinator , mr. neil sharkey .
there has been a serious need for more qualified justices of the peace in our communities .
as a territory , we have made the commitment to a community based justice system .
but how can we call the system community based when the court only arrives in some locations every six months .
inuit justices of the peace reside in their own communities and hear cases frequently .
the other important benefit is that they speak the inuktitut language and they understand the issues and dynamics of the communities in which they serve .
i believe that this is another way in which we are seeing the principals of inuit qaujimajatuqangit being applied in the justice system .
i would like to point out that we managed to get federal funding to cover the costs of both these training programs for two years .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. anawak .
ministers &apos; statements .
mr. picco .
minister &apos;s statement 13 - 1 ( 3 ) :
integration of health and social services health boards
hon. ed picco :
uqaqti , i wish to inform the house of the progress achieved to date towards the integration of the three health and social services boards .
we are building a unified health and social services department for nunavut .
the work required for integration is mostly administrative at this time , though it is complicated and it must be done well to ensure services continue to be delivered properly .
this work is on track and will continue right through to april 2000 .
as well mr. speaker , i repeat that the government is committed to a &quot; no layoff &quot; policy for any employees whose jobs are affected by integration .
mrs. rosemary cooper , assistant deputy minister of my department has also been assigned full time to the integration and decentralization initiatives .
an integration co-ordinator has been contracted to assist in the integration of both education and health and social services .
the integration planning committee for our senior managers of all three boards at the department has met three times .
it has provided direction to a series of working committees , again with participation from all three boards , and the department as well as the central agencies .
they &apos;re currently working on the many administrative details .
mr. speaker , integration is only the first of a series of steps towards the building of a health and social services system designed by and for all of nunavummiut .
the redesign of the current system will evolve over the next several years .
it will include honouring our commitment to decentralized positions both in pangnirtung and to kugluktuk .
this will certainly be part of the system design work which lies ahead .
mr. speaker , in the meantime , i have directed the department to enter into discussions with community governments regarding interim arrangements .
some nunavut communities already have some form of a committee , usually a sub-committee of the hamlet which considers wellness promotion and other related health and social services programs .
these committees can be the focus of discussions that might take place in communities and between communities and the department .
we would be prepared to provide some support to such an approach on an interim basis .
mr. speaker , as we move through integration and begin discussions about the future , i am more and more convinced that this unification of the system is the right thing to do .
i look forward to providing members and the public with further details over the coming months .
thank you , mr. speaker .
&gt; &gt; applause

mr. arvaluk .
minister &apos;s statement 14 - 1 ( 3 ) :
schools integration project
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker i would like to provide members with an update on the progress made by education nunavut on the schools integration project .
as you will remember , a decision was made in april of this year to dissolve both education and health boards of management by july 1 , 2000 .
since that time , an implementation co-ordinator has been hired to manage the project and i am pleased with the progress we have made .
i provided you with a copy of the implementation co-ordinator &apos;s handbook in august so that you would have an overview of how this project will be implemented .
since april , i have briefed all district education councils with the exception of the kivalliq council .
i will be attending their next regularly scheduled meeting to discuss these issues as well as the re-writing of the education act .
headquarters staff have also met the divisional education council with board staff and with the majority of school principals in nunavut to provide briefings and to answer questions .
( interpretation ends ) mr. speaker , discussions have also been held with the nunavut social development council and with the legislative standing committee on culture education and health .
( interpretation ) mr. speaker , i &apos;m confident this will result in more cost effective regional structures .
( interpretation ends ) organization charts for the new regional schools will be ready within the next month .
we are targeting staff for appointments to re-describe positions .
this will be completed before christmas .
this should lessen any anxiety on the part of staff and provide the system with the required stability to do the required work that will be needed prior to july 2000 .
as you know , there will be no layoffs as a result of the organization changes .
( interpretation ) mr. speaker , in summary , the work is on schedule and i &apos;m confident that the integration schedule will be a success .
the success will include a department and myself as minister of education , closer and more accountable to the students and all nunavummiut .

minister &apos;s statement 15 - 1 ( 3 ) :
sustainable development &apos;s implementation of the bathurst priorities
hon. peter kilabuk :
thank you , mr. speaker .
during the summer i had the opportunity to speak with people in my community about our government .
i discussed the challenges that our government faces and the work that lies ahead with leading the department of sustainable development , our department , with a broad and diverse mandate .
each dog is different but they are a team and because they are a team , when they work together , they are powerful .
they are more powerful than any snow machine . &quot;
this elder reminded me that it is my job to make sure that everyone on the team knows my direction and that the traces in my hands must be taut .
( interpretation ends ) i will speak about the direction that we have established for our government as a whole in the bathurst mandate .
i am pleased to be able to speak to you about the role of the department of sustainable development .
after the cabinet meeting in bathurst inlet in august , i called together the senior staff in my department .
i outlined for them the direction i wanted our department to take in the next 180 days .
i described for them five major areas in which i expect our department to provide leadership .
each relates to the bathurst mandate and the four goals we set for this government .
( interpretation ) first , i stressed the need for us to communicate effectively with the people of nunavut .
mr. speaker , i travelled extensively in nunavut throughout the summer and everywhere the message was the same , keep us informed about what the government is doing .
so i have told my staff in sustainable development , people expect that we will faithfully and regularly communicate with them .
i want my department to be a leader in the government &apos;s effort .
secondly , i have asked my department to strengthen it &apos;s community presence .
we must work to provide more support for our wildlife officers and for the community economic development officers in each community .
thirdly , i have stated in this house before and i emphasized it again with my staff that job creation is a priority of our department .
speaker :
mr. kilabuk , can you please be seated ?
i apologize , your time of 20 minutes is up and you can request consent from the members to continue .
hon. peter kilabuk :
i would like to request consent from the members .
speaker :
thank you mr. kilabuk .
mr. kilabuk has requested to continue with his minister &apos;s statement .
any objections .
mr. kilabuk you have a consensus .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
a key to job creation is a partnership with the federal government .
moreover , mr. speaker , i have reasonable hopes that our current negotiations with diand will result in the establishment of a nunavut economic development agreement this year .
i cannot emphasize enough the gains and benefits of working with our partners both in economic development and in our co-management responsibilities for our environment and our wildlife .
( interpretation ) the bathurst mandate calls for nunavummiut to be self-reliant .
self-reliance is not being able to go at it alone , self-reliance is pulling your weight as part of a team , making full use of your own resources and abilities .
when we combine our resources and abilities with others in partnership , each one is stronger .
as a fourth priority , i am determined that we must simplify our program delivery .
finally mr. speaker , i have told my staff of the pride i take in the leadership they have provided in our efforts in this government to apply inuit qaujimajatuqangit .
this government team we have been told is making a trail in new snow .
our elders have pointed to the direction we must take and inuit qaujimajatuqangit reminds us that learning is not only about discovering what is ahead of us .
learning must be about understanding who we are and how we can use our strengths to find our way into the future .
( interpretation ends ) i would like to refer briefly now to specific programs my department will be undertaking in the next six months which will address the bathurst mandate directly .
mr. speaker , through my travels this summer , i have heard from our hunters about the existing wildlife act , and it &apos;s outdated approach to wildlife management .
this important new proposed legislation will be brought to cabinet only after extensive public consultation .
a major part of the work of my department is dedicated to community capacity building .
we work routinely with our partners in other government departments , the inuit organizations , hamlets and the federal government on wellness , community development , labour force development and economic development .
community planning is essential to our work .
( interpretation ) we will continue to provide direct financial support to communities wishing to establish their development plans .
we will continue our support for community economic development officers and their professional organization , the nunavut economic developers association .
( interpretation ends ) concerning my statements on the nunavut economy made during the last session .
we are working toward an economic strategy for nunavut .
to this end , i am committing to a consultation process in which i will invite participants from each community to contribute to the creation of a nunavut plan for economic development .
i anticipate this process beginning early in the new calendar year .
but in the meantime mr. speaker , my department will continue to pursue opportunities for our growing labour force .
i &apos;ve already stated how important i regard communication by government with the public .
this is the key to achieving the goal we set in bathurst to simplify government .
my department produces and distributes a wide range of information , ranging from permits and licenses to wildlife and environmental protection .
all these documents and publications currently are being revised and translated to make them more accessible and understandable to people .
mr. speaker , as part of our efforts to simplify and enhance business support programs , we will continue the implementation of one stop program delivery with our partners in each region .
at first this will involve linking our programs with those of the regional community future organizations and we will continue to work toward one stop program delivery with the inuit organizations as well .
we will continue to support nunavut development corporations .
my department will maintain our assistance to nunavut tourism , the nunavut arts and crafts association and the nunavut economic developers association .
organizations whose work directly effects our economic prospects in nunavut .
mr. speaker , i have spoken about some of the ways my department will support the bathurst mandate in the achievement of three goals , healthy communities , simplicity in government and self-reliance .
mr. speaker , let me conclude by referring to the fourth and last goal , learning .
much of the work of my department depends on training and capacity building .
our people must have the knowledge and skills to take full advantage of our rich economic prospects .
we will work with our partners in education to help ensure nunavummiut are able to assume important roles and the majority of the jobs in the development of our mining industry .
we have a labour force in nunavut , mr. speaker , with distinct characteristics , some of which are unique among working people in canada .
( interpretation ) mr. speaker , i feel very confident that we have a good working team at the department of sustainable development .
that we can pull our weight and help to ensure this government reaches the goals that we set in bathurst inlet .

mr. douglas lem &apos;s business anniversary

this celebration was held in mr. lem &apos;s business premises and it was truly an uplifting chinese ceremony .
douglas lem , along with his father , operates nunavut catering and consulting in my riding and regularly provide services to us .
doug is a town councillor and a tireless worker and provides food to the less fortunate in our community .

coral harbour bridge
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i stand today concerning the bridge that was built recently in salliit , coral harbour .
i just came back recently and i was able to use that bridge myself and i wanted to mention that today .
the government staff and the community people are benefiting from that because coral harbour residents have been working really hard towards getting that bridge .
the contractors , even though it wasn &apos;t in the terms of reference of the contract , did over and beyond the call , in trying to get the project done .
it has really encouraged them that nunavut is there for them .
i am sure that a lot of people who would have just stayed home without having transportation are able to use the bridge to go out on the land and relax .
i am sure it is obvious that it is going to help them spiritually and it will benefit the people .

suicide prevention
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i rise today to make the same statement that i made when we were opening up our first meeting in april in regards to suicide .
suicides in my community started in the 60 &apos;s and from there i have lost three of my immediate family members to suicide in the 1980 &apos;s .
i used to think , mr. speaker , that after i lost three of my immediate family members through suicide it was too late to do anything about suicide prevention .
afterwards i found out that suicide is not going to stop and we have to work hard to prevent it .
i know that even if we use a lot of money , suicide will always keep happening , there is not much we can do .
we can never find out what causes suicides , because there are a lot of reasons that make people commit suicide .
those who are very serious about committing suicide will never tell anybody what their reasons are .
it is only after the fact that we find out how serious their problems were .
i would like to urge the members here , through my third statement , that we have to help our people of nunavummiut .
i am speaking from my heart when i say that we should pray together with our children in order to prevent suicide from happening .
thank you , mr. speaker .

item 6 :
oral questions
question 31 - 1 ( 3 ) :
integration of health &amp; social services
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i have a question that i will direct to the minister of health . i think it was on the 22nd that you made some comments and this is in relation to that .
in your opening remarks you said you would give the communities more authority in the future .
i know there is going to be an amalgamation of the three health boards .
in regards to community empowerment , how long is it going to take to give more authority to the communities and fully implement community empowerment .
speaker :
minister of health , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
qujannamiik mr. speaker .
with that , we are trying to figure out what we will have after april 1st , 2000 .
but in health , we didn &apos;t have anything on the ground except in some communities we had sub-committees of health under the communities or community health committees .
we should have a community based approach , looking at empowerment issues .
so i appreciate the member &apos;s question .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. picco .
oral questions .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
and again , you said that there was almost a 9 million dollar deficit with the health boards .
in regards to this deficit , what caused the deficit and why was there an accumulation of all these deficits over the years .
speaker :
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , to use a phrase ; that &apos;s the sixty four thousand dollar question .
but , to be serious , the 8.9 million dollar deficit as of march 31st of this year , was announced because the three health boards tabled their audited statements .
it would indicate that the debt , the 8.9 million dollars , that has been discussed publicly , was previous to the nunavut government being set up .
through our analysis that we are trying to do right now within the department of health &amp; social services , it seems to be consistent underfunding in the department of health since the gnwt .
over the past several years the health boards have come forward with supplementary appropriations within the budget framework to be able to re-float or to re-base the health budget in the gnwt .
as of april 1st when nunavut took over we inherited that 8.9 million dollars .
we are seeing instances of diabetes , we are seeing increases in cancers , indeed mr. speaker , we are seeing increases in other diseases like rsv and respiratory diseases .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
oral questions .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my last question .
the government of the nwt had quite a huge deficit and i believe it was in the 32 million dollar range , where they had their deficit .
you didn &apos;t pay the gnwt &apos;s deficit of 32 million dollars when we became nunavut .
i believe that is included , did you pay for the gnwt deficit , mr. picco ?
speaker :
thank you .
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i am wondering if the member could repeat , i only got part of the question .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. picco .
if you could rephrase your question mr. nutarak , he didn &apos;t hear part of the question .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
did you pay for that 32 million dollar deficit from the nunavut government .
speaker :
thank you mr. nutarak .
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
so that &apos;s all i can speak to mr. speaker , not the 32 million , if that is the question .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. picco .

mr. iqaqrialu .
question 32 - 1 ( 3 ) :
government support for unilingual businesspersons
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is for the department of sustainable development regarding the minister &apos;s statement .
you mentioned about supporting the small business in the communities , about having a credit union or having some kind of grants and loans programs for the small businesses .
my question is can the unilingual people who can &apos;t read and write english , how are you going to improve the benefits for them from the statements that you made earlier .
i think we should definitely have something simple in place like an application form to be used by unilingual people .
are you going to come up with something like that for them ?
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
i believe you had two questions there , there was one for sustainable development .
mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
since we just started with the department we have been reviewing all the application forms and all the forms that have to be filled out and how to make proposals .
i reviewed that this year .
if they want to start a small business , we are trying to set up a place where they can apply for funding .
we are trying to put together consistent application forms for everybody .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i have a question for the minister of ntpc .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu you have to ask your questions to only one minister on the same subject .
so if you are going to ask a question of the minister of ntpc you will have to wait for later .
mr. iqaqrialu , do you have a question for the same minister .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
we have to leave very shortly , i can ask tomorrow .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
i don &apos;t want to stop you or anything but when you are asking a minister a question , you have to direct your questions to the same minister before you ask another question .
thank you .
oral questions .
mr. irqittuq .
question 33 - 1 ( 3 ) :
definition of inuit qaujimajatuqangit
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i have a question for the premier .
during our present sitting , you kept mentioning inuit qaujimajatuqangit when we are sitting in the house .
what exactly does inuit qaujimajatuqangit mean .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
inuit qaujimajatuqangit is interpreted in several different ways , but we try to use it in the best possible ways .
we are now in the process of looking at the legislation of the government and our elders are our mentors in trying to get inuit qaujimajatuqangit implemented in our laws .
inuit qaujimajatuqangit had been misinterpreted in the past and right now our department is reviewing all of this information and putting it together .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
oral questions mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
inuit qaujimajatuqangit , you want to include this in your departments or in the nunavut government .
if you are going to use inuit qaujimajatuqangit for example , is that going to give us more power in our activities or in our governance ?
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
mr. okalik .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
we are all using them as our mentors to include inuit qaujimajatuqangit and how we can better use it in our daily business .
so we don &apos;t just leave it on the side because i am sure it is really going to benefit us in the future .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. premier .
oral questions , mr. akesuk .
question 34 - 1 ( 3 ) :
housing for social worker
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is directed to the minister of the housing corporation .
the social worker doesn &apos;t have any housing available in kimmirut .
have you looked into finding possible housing for our social worker .
i think the only problem we have right now is housing for that person .
speaker :
thank you mr. akesuk .
minister of housing , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the public housing and staff housing policies are separate from each other because they were transferred over from the previous government .
we are reviewing through our task force how we can improve our housing policies .
the staff housing constructed by ncc are not being used right now because of the policies that are in place .

section 25 of the act has already been varied by a regulation that has been signed by the commissioner and registered under our statutory instruments act on september 7 , 1999 .
( interpretation ) when we have the same time zone in nunavut there is going to be better public communication and better small business communication in all of nunavut .
when we have this one time zone it will also benefit the nunavut government .

mr. speaker it gives me great pleasure to rise before the house today to make this announcement .

inuktitut training for nunavut government employees
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i rise today to advise the members of this house on the importance of inuktitut language usage in our daily government business activities .
on october 19 , 1999 the government of nunavut initiated the first session of inuktitut language training for the government of nunavut employees in iqaluit .
this initiative is a joint undertaking between the departments of human resources , education and culture , language , elders &amp; youth who instituted this language training program .
the purpose of the inuktitut training program is to improve the way we serve the public .
our government is committed to providing inuktitut training for all public servants and this is what we should be moving forward on in this area .
this is only an initial pilot project , in the new year courses will be taught throughout nunavut at various skill levels .
the courses will be developed through the nunavut arctic college as they have community learning centres in most of the communities .
participants will learn the inuktitut dialect of their home community or region .
instruction will begin in basic inuktitut and will reflect the language needs of the office environment .
mr. speaker this language training is consistent with the governments mandate to use inuktitut as a working language .
we encourage all employees to participate and advance their language skills .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. havioyak .
mr. arvaluk .
minister &apos;s statement 19 - 1 ( 3 ) :
income support policy review
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i am pleased to announce that the department of education will be undertaking a policy review for the income support program .
the income support program , as inherited from the gnwt is a program that requires new thinking on the part of the nunavut government .
we as a government must encourage self-reliance instead of dependence .
( interpretation ) mr. speaker , this policy review will solicit the views of nunavut citizens and provide direction to the government on how to redesign the current program .
the report resulting from the review will be used as the foundation for the development of a more responsive and effective income support program for residents of nunavut .
the community consultation process will be lead by a forum of nunavut citizens appointed by myself .
( interpretation ends ) i will keep this assembly advised of the progress we make on this very important issue .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
i would like to thank the minister for making his statement .
as soon as we have a copy of the minister &apos;s statement , copies will be given to the members .

mr. anawak .
minister &apos;s statement 20 - 1 ( 3 ) :
nunavut emergency plan approval
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
this plan will ensure a co-ordinated immediate response by the government of nunavut to any form of peacetime emergency .
( interpretation ) it strengthens our role in working together in co-operation with our local authorities in aiding them in dealing with emergencies within their individual communities .
we need to work closely with our local communities who have considerable knowledge in dealing with situations within their home communities .
my nunavut emergency services staff will work to ensure other agencies with lead responsibilities are listening to and reacting positively to community concerns and directions .
( interpretation ends ) the plan now approved will be translated into the official languages of nunavut and put into clearly marked binders for distribution across nunavut .
once this plan is released we will have complied with both our act and the mou on emergency preparedness entered into with the federal government .
at the same time work is continuing on updating the regional plans .
support will also be provided to our local authorities in drafting their new peacetime plans .
far too often they do not even hear a word of thank you following the long and sometimes stressful hours they have put in on an emergency .
it is my hope that we can recognize these individuals in a more positive way . to this end i will be seeking your input and would welcome any suggestions that you may have .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
mr. havioyak .
minister &apos;s statement 21 - 1 ( 3 ) :
inuit qaujimajatuqangit
hon. donald havioyak :
qoanna uqaqti .
i am pleased to speak to the house about inuit qaujimajatuqangit .
the government of nunavut recognizes that the inuit of nunavut have acquired a vast store of inuit qaujimajatuqangit through their experience of living in close harmony with the land .
as minister for the department of culture , language , elders &amp; youth , i feel that we must continue the use of inuit qaujimajatuqangit and support in its practical application .
inuit qaujimajatuqangit is a valid and essential source of information about people &apos;s relationships with each other , the formation of health communities and as a guiding principle for governance .
inuit qaujimajatuqangit is also a valid and essential source of information about the natural environment , the use of natural resources , and the relationship of people to the land .
there are several guiding principles that are helping us in our efforts .
we believe that we must work in close co-operation with the nunavut social development council as described in article 32 of the land claims agreement ;
perceive oral tradition as a reliable source of information about inuit qaujimajatuqangit ;
develop and deliver programs and services in the manner consistent with beliefs , customs , knowledge , values and language of the people being served .
this means that inuit qaujimajatuqangit must be a primary consideration in the design and delivery of the government programs , services and policies .
the department of culture , language , elders &amp; youth has been working very hard to promote and support inuit qaujimajatuqangit in our government .
our department has begun development of the inuit qaujimajatuqangit policy .
consultations about this draft policy have begun and we presented a version at the nunavut social development council &apos;s board meeting at the end of september .
the policy proposes to establish inuit qaujimajatuqangit co-ordinators within each department in the government .
our first inuit qaujimajatuqangit workshop was held in iqaluit to determine what inuit qaujimajatuqangit means and to make recommendations for implementation .
the government of nunavut employees attended the workshop and various elders from the communities were our resource people .
a report of this first workshop will be available by the end of the month .
our government has received the nunavut social development councils report on traditional knowledge and we are using it as one of our guiding principles .
the department of culture , language , elders &amp; youth is a part of an inuit qaujimajatuqangit working group with representatives from the different departments .
this group has worked hard to keep inuit qaujimajatuqangit in the forefront of the government and supported its development as our department gathers momentum .
the department of culture , language , elders &amp; youth has created a inuit qaujimajatuqangit co-ordinator position that will assist us to priorize inuit qaujimajatuqangit throughout the government .
inuit qaujimajatuqangit makes us different from other governments .
we have a unique identity and must be proactive in integrating it into our everyday governance .
thank you , mr. speaker .

ms. thompson .
minister &apos;s statement 22 - 1 ( 3 ) :
nunavut &apos;s business incentive policy
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker , i rise today to advise the members of the legislative assembly regarding our progress in reviewing the nunavut business incentive policy .
mr. speaker , i am pleased to announce to the members and the public that i have established a working group that will focus it &apos;s efforts on reviewing this policy .
as well the development of this policy demonstrates the commitment of this government to adhere to our obligations under the nunavut land claim agreement .
our willingness to support nunavut businesses and inuit firms in coming first will have a positive influence on inuit employment and training .
( interpretation ) mr. speaker , over the coming weeks the business incentive policy working group will be actively soliciting your input and direction .
it is planned that the working group will be touring the communities and hosting public meetings in november .
( interpretation ends ) mr. speaker out timelines to review this policy are short as the nunavut business incentive policy needs to be in place for the next contracting season .
it is my hope that a final draft will be ready for public review early in the new year .
thank you .

hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :

today i am very proud that in my constituency of coral harbour that sakku school has made an important difference since the school opened this year .

opposition to time change
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
to represent my constituency i also would like to make a member &apos;s statement in regards to the premier &apos;s comment .
it is quite on the contrary to what he has just stated .
having one time zone in nunavut was initiated by the mayors of nunavut and they discussed that it would be ideal to have one time zone for nunavut .
mr. speaker , we were so glad to have one time zone for nunavut .
we should have discussed the time change with our constituents .
at this time , if that &apos;s implemented it will be noon hour right now .
perhaps in the month of december , we &apos;d be out of this house by the time it gets really dark outside .
on single time zone issue , i will be working very hard against it and i will ask oral questions tomorrow on it .

mr. speaker , yesterday , i visited one of the communities in my constituency to attend a graduation .
i was very appreciative for being invited .
we were so proud to see the graduates .
i encourage the young people to complete their education because they can obtain jobs that we obviously couldn &apos;t .
i was so proud of the fact that i was invited to the ceremony as a member for the legislative assembly for their community for the first time .

mr. kattuk .
member &apos;s statement 34 - 1 ( 3 ) :
relocation of sanikiluaq residents
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
today i rise to talk about my community of sanikiluaq .
at the end of &apos; 60s , sanikiluaq residents were relocated from two settlements , a north camp and a south camp .
the federal government and our previous gnwt , had relocated us to live in one settlement .
they said it would be better if we had moved to one settlement .
so they had relocated some of the people who were in their own camps , the relatives , brothers and sisters .
they had a conflicts with each other because of the relocation .
i remember back then i was a student in the school at the time when i was almost at the verge of getting out of school when they relocated us .
i remember and i have seen and experienced being moved from the south camp .
however , i &apos;m very proud that the old camp was cleaned up last year , sponsored by the federal government through qikiqtani inuit association .
when the old camp was cleaned up it was quite difficult for some people .
we felt the emotions of the people because the old homes were burned down .
in spite of that , i know it did not have an impact on all the community residents of sanikiluaq but it had an impact on the people who lived in that camp .
so they established a committee to deal with this issue and mr. speaker , the committee will be looking for funds through the aboriginal programs .
thank you .

hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
in regards to this position , it will be here in iqaluit as is the case now .

speaker :
oral question .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , if we &apos;re to have true decentralization , i believe that you have to take all the steps necessary to make that happen .
mr. arvaluk , the minister of education , indicated that in relationship to arctic college for example , that these jobs along with the president would be located in arviat .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister responsible for housing , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the original plan was to have the president based here .
when i say here , it &apos;s iqaluit , the capital of nunavut .
the ministers are based here in the capital .
that was the original plan and the adms could be based elsewhere in the outlying communities of nunavut .
i am the only minister without a deputy minister in the capital and as you know , housing is a very important issue for nunavut .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. thompson .
oral questions .
mr. o &apos;brien .

speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister responsible for housing , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson :
thank you , mr. speaker .
that was a misinterpretation i did not say this was a short term solution .
the position was always in iqaluit .
it &apos;s not going to be short term , this is where the position is going to be .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you ms. thompson .
mr. o &apos;brien would you like to rephrase your question ?
mr. o &apos;brien i will allow your final supplementary .
mr. o &apos;brien :

i have a question for the minister of education .
i believe that &apos;s the appropriate minister .
i would like know if there &apos;s anything in the education act that we inherited from the gnwt for students who are employed in the summer .
there were summer student employment programs held in the summer in my community and they also had programs for drop outs .
is there such legislation .
i would like to know if there &apos;s a clause in the legislation that says that they have to have first priority .

mr. puqiqnak , thank you .
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :

we &apos;re planning to set up such a program so that the students can be employed during the summer .
speaker :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :

i know that .
well , we know that during the summer break the students fill out forms in order to be employed for the summer .
there &apos;s also the other students who have dropped out of school .
they &apos;re no longer in the school system and usually these drop outs don &apos;t even know how to fill out forms and some of them have children and they &apos;re very young parents .
i could use my community as an example .
it &apos;s a very small community and there &apos;s very high unemployment in the smaller communities .
there &apos;s seasonal employment in the summer and the drop outs are not given as much opportunity as the ones who are off for the summer .
it seems like first priority is given to the kids who are in school .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
i don &apos;t hear a question .
i would like to remind the house that if you &apos;re going to be asking a question you could use an example and then ask a question at the end of your statement .
you go to the preamble and then ask your question afterwards following the house rules .

question 39 - 1 ( 3 ) : pond inlet school
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
there &apos;s three schools in pond inlet at this time and the third one was closed for safety reasons .
this was a school that would have been utilized by the students and there is a shortage of classroom space to accommodate the students .
the pond inlet education authority has been asking the minister of education to add additional classrooms to ulaayuk school and of course there &apos;s no gym in it either .
there was a school built this fall and the gym is too small to accommodate the students , so they &apos;re kind of in an uncomfortable situation .
i believe the education authority has been asking the minister of education to make additions to the ulaayuk school to expand the size of the gym .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. nutarak .
the minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
mr. arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker yes i have reviewed this .
speaker :
thank you , mr. arvaluk .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
since you said you &apos;ve reviewed it i believe the education authority in pond inlet has written a letter .
i would like to get a copy of your response to the education authority .
are you going to be making additions this summer , or is it going to be in next year &apos;s budget .
speaker :
thank you mr. nutarak .
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
yes .
after we got a letter from the education authority &apos;s chair , we took this into consideration .
these are able to be drawn ... the blueprints ... for the higher classes , the gym is too small and we &apos;re also getting architectural drawings for a larger gym .
we &apos;re looking at 400 thousand dollars for architects , so they could develop blueprints for these two schools , possible additional classrooms and gym and the high school gym to be expanded .
so we &apos;re going to be trying to find out from the community whether it &apos;s supported by the people of pond inlet .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you , mr. arvaluk .
oral questions . mr. o &apos;brien .
question 40 - 1 ( 3 ) :
budget consultations
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is for the minister of finance .
i &apos;m wondering if the minister would give some more rationale to the people of nunavut regarding the intent and what we hope will be outcome of these consultations . thank you .
speaker :
thank you , mr. o &apos;brien . hon. kelvin ng :
mr. speaker , the intent would be twofold :
to identify , not just from the perspective of capital needs , but also from the perspective of program needs , so it &apos;s a free flow .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you , mr. ng .
oral questions .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
so i guess my question is :
the input and the information that we gather , will it really have an impact on , for example , this year &apos;s capital budget and program ?
thank you .
speaker :
thank you , mr. o &apos;brien .
minister of finance , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i think there would be a concern that we don &apos;t want to create false expectations that we can deliver everything that communities or individuals may want out there .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you , mr. ng .
mr. o &apos;brien .
i would like to caution members that we do have interpreters and we do have unilingual members here .

oral questions , mr. akesuk .
question 41 - 1 ( 3 ) :
effects of decentralization
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
we have two schools , but they are filled to capacity and our student teacher ratio is quite high in one of the schools in our community .
in the past , when it was gnwt , the blueprint had been completed for the adult education school in cape dorset .
i was wondering if the minister can review this again as a priority for the adult education school . if that school is built it could alleviate a lot of space needs .
thank you .
speaker :
minister for education , mr. arvaluk
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
yes , i know that was planned in the past , and the letters are so small , i can &apos;t even see the numbers .
i &apos;m not trying to say i don &apos;t know , but in the month of november we will be touring all the communities of nunavut .
during that tour , i want to hear more from the cape dorset residents .
so i &apos;d like to get their input .
but at this point i can say we do have a five year plan .
however , i don &apos;t want to say what the residents of cape dorset want until i go visit the community .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you , mr. arvaluk .

mr. iqaqrialu
question 42 - 1 ( 3 ) :
time zone ( out of order ) time zone change
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
i would like to ask the premier of nunavut about the single time zone .
the keewatin and kitikmeot time change will not impact on their daylight .
the reason i would like to ask this is when are we going to discuss this topic of single time zones .
i would like to ask the premier when we are going to discuss this in the house ?
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
in regards to your question , i will rule you out of order .
it has to be dealt with by the committee of the whole .
this has been referred to the appropriate committee and it must be deliberated upon in the committee of the whole .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu : ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker i hope we &apos;re not going to have to wait until the day we change the clocks , on the 31st , thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu , we &apos;ll deal with that before october 31st .
mr. irqittuq .
question 43 - 1 ( 3 ) :
contractors use of government equipment
mr. irqittuq : ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i asked this question last spring and the question i asked at that time had an impact on two different ministers .
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;ll be asking the minister for transportation or for human resources .
my question was never replied to .
i don &apos;t know if it was replied to by written response .
i have not seen a written response as of yet .
my question was , because anybody in the nunavut area can put in a bid for a contract , can the contractor utilize government equipment in order to benefit themselves to win a contract ?
thank you , mr. speaker
speaker :
mr. irqittuq , thank you .
minister of public works and services , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson :
( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker this question was brought up by that same member .
i did direct one member of my staff to work on this issue , but since this person got another job , i am assuming that the appropriate response wasn &apos;t given .
the original question was whether employees could use airport staff .
the deputy minister , ross mrazek , was not aware of the issue that was happening in that particular community and i apologize that i didn &apos;t know about it either .
there was a change in staff and the deputy ministers so this issue wasn &apos;t dealt with .
mr. ross mrazek is presently working on it .
i &apos;ll take that as notice .
thank you .
speaker :
( interpretation ) :
thank you .
it &apos;s taken as notice by the minister .
thank you , ms. thompson .

mr. puqiqnak .
question 44 - 1 ( 3 ) :
priority over dropouts
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i have a question on the same issue i raised earlier .
i want to get further clarification on it first .
the question is for the minister of education regarding students who are given first priority over dropouts , is there a regulation or law ?
speaker :
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
its part of the program criteria .
this program was set up so that the students could be employed over the summer with preference over dropouts , just during the summer .
as for dropouts , as long as they &apos;re in canada , they can look for jobs anywhere , anytime .
but this program is specifically geared towards students who are on summer break .
speaker :
thank you , mr. arvaluk .
oral questions .
mr. puqiqnak :
( interpretation ) :
yes , i understand that .
i do understand it , but who has more authority , are the deas given authority to put first priority on the students for this program .
speaker :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you , mr. speaker these program dollars from the government are funnelled possibly through the hamlet council or the dea .
these particular monies are funnelled through an agency and there &apos;s an agreement between the two parties .
through a contribution agreement , probably for his community , these program dollars would specifically say that it would be used for students for the summer break .
we would make a contribution agreement saying that these monies would be specifically geared for the summer students .
speaker :
thank you , mr. arvaluk .
mr. nutarak .
question 45 - 1 ( 3 ) :
invitation to education minister
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker i don &apos;t recall putting up my hand , but since you called my name i might as well ask a question .
i had already written down my question and i think you found out that i wanted to make a comment even before i said anything .
my question is to the minister of education .
on november 30 , the minister has been invited to go to pond inlet .
the same invitation is extended to myself and to the minister of education .
i would like to get a copy of your response to that correspondence from the dea .
so my question is are you going to be coming up to pond inlet on november 30 as you were invited .
thank you , mr. speaker
speaker :
thank you , mr. nutarak .
minister of education .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
since it &apos;s not just to open a school , i will be going up .
there &apos;s also going to be a qia youth conference , so i &apos;ll be there on november 30 .

question 46 - 1 ( 3 ) :
proper spelling of names
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question is directed to the minister responsible for culture .
mr. speaker , my colleague from gjoa haven brought up an issue the other day that also affects my constituency , in reference to the proper spelling of names .
in some cases , where people have had their names changed in spelling it just doesn &apos;t mean the same any more .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you , mr. o &apos;brien .
minister responsible for culture , youth , elders and language , mr. havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .

my staff are aware of this issue . we also need better planning for the future to address this matter .
thank you very much .
speaker :
thank you , mr. havioyak .

minister responsible for education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker yes , they will know what their terms of reference are .
we will want to continue discussions with the divisional boards as we &apos;ve been doing to date .
the divisional board staff will keep working and will report directly to my portfolio .
so there will be an ongoing process and mr. speaker , we &apos;re looking forward to it .
we would like the communities to decide what responsibilities they will take and give an estimate on how much it would cost to take on those additional responsibilities at the community level .

airline routes
mr. mclean :
thank you , mr. speaker .
nunavut is on its way .
we &apos;re into our seventh month and i know the centres of the universe are in strategic locations , and airlines have got to recognize that the traffic patterns are changing in nunavut .
i was just reading an ad in a magazine &quot; more flights , more choices &quot; by one of the largest airlines in nunavut .
thank you .

mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na uqaqti .
that &apos;s very good that we are doing these things , that &apos;s beneficial to all of us .
but getting back to decentralization , my favourite topic .
gjoa haven is a decentralized community , cambridge bay , kugluktuk , arviat , baker , rankin , and communities like that .
so has that been considered also with decentralization coming on too , the increased traffic patterns .
ma &apos;na .
speaker :
ma &apos;na mr. mclean .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you , mr. speaker .
so that was one of the main focuses for cambridge bay , we thought we would try it out and see how much traffic there is .
but we are open to other communities that may want some surveys done with our employees .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. premier .

mr. o &apos;brien .
question 50 - 1 ( 3 ) :
list of consultants
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question is to the premier and i realize that he probably doesn &apos;t have this information at his fingertips , although he may .
and would the premier be prepared to have that information to the house prior to the close of this session .
there shouldn &apos;t be that many people , but if he would do that i would appreciate it .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik :
could the member clarify if it is for every single contract this government has issued since april 1 .
speaker :
thank you mr. premier . please clarify your question mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
yes , since we started on april 1 .
if that information could be made available to the house .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. okalik .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you , mr. speaker .
there are some contracts that we assumed as well before april 1 , so how far back do we go .
there are some contracts that we inherited and we extended as required for the services .
so how far should i go in trying to meet the members concerns .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i was aware that there were some commitments that had already been agreed to that &apos;s why i indicated since april 1 , since we started the government .
new contracts from that point on .

mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na uqaqti .
concerning the recent announcement by the public service alliance in regard to the pay equity victory .
we know that it is going to cost the federal government five billion dollars to deal with their employees and it is being appealed .
could the minister responsible advise me as to how this is going to affect us .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
minister of finance , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i was wrong . i would like to correct that for the record , it was not a supreme court ruling , it was a federal court ruling .
but the federal government hasn &apos;t decided whether or not they are going to proceed with a possible supreme court appeal on that ruling .
so i don &apos;t have that information as of today but we are certainly aware of it mr. speaker .

mr. iqaqrialu .
question 52 - 1 ( 3 ) :
awarding of contracts
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
to the minister of human resources , this document states that in february or march the private business policy would be amended .
but to date , last june we stated and passed a motion that the various contracts would be awarded to nunavut companies .
there was a motion passed in june , which i have seen and this has not been adhered to .
if the nunavut companies are not going to be awarded contracts in nunavut , then we are not going to develop nunavut .
perhaps in the month of february and march 2000 , does that mean that we won &apos;t be awarded any contracts in nunavut .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister of public works , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the policy is going to be reviewed because we have inherited the business incentive policy form the gnwt .
we are still using it at this point in time , we had made a small change and under a minister &apos;s statement i announced that the change was from nwt to nunavut .
we still have to amend that incentive policy .
we are looking at how we can incorporate article 24 into the business policy , but the policy is in place .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. thompson .
mr. o &apos;brien .
speaker :
sorry mr. o &apos;brien .
i don &apos;t know if the interpretation was accurate .
question period is over until there &apos;s a motion to extend the question period .
question period is over .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
mr. speaker , i move to extend the question period .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
there is motion on the floor and the motion is not debatable .
all those in favour ?
all those opposed ?
motion is carried .
our policy is to extend it for 60 minutes , and according to our policy unless it is changed we have another 60 minutes .

mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker and to my colleague for extending question period and to the rest of my colleagues for agreeing to it .

speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
minister responsible for transportation , mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak :
thank you , mr. speaker .
even before the election while i was in the position of interim commissioner of nunavut , i initiated talks with the airlines about the possibility of the air routes changing .
however , again , as interim commissioner , and later as minister i was encouraged by the willingness of the airlines to look at the possibility of changing the air routes .

question 55 - 1 ( 3 ) :
gun legislation
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i asked this question last spring so i will be asking it over again in regards to gun legislation .
we know that the gun legislation is not compatible with the inuit life style and we have been lobbying the government and we were going to be lobbying against the federal government in ottawa .
so i would like to ask the minister of justice what kind of developments there have been .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kattuk .
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :

the inuit people in the communities have to adhere to the gun legislation .
i want one of the staff members to consult with the hunters and the inuit people locally to make sure that they know what they are doing .
speaker :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
yes , the federal government would have to pay for this type of consultation process .
we are now working on the gun legislation but the federal government will have to work on this other part , and we would just be supporting them .

lobbying for funding
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
now that i am going to be asking my question i am sure that we will be running out of time .
to the minister of finance .
i am sure that all our needs and our priorities are not going to go ahead due to limited funds .
have you approached the federal government to see if we can get more funding for those departments .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , not directly .
i know that different ministers at different meetings with their federal counterparts have brought up issues on specific needs , or plan on undertaking that initiative if they haven &apos;t already .
so , not from the perspective of formula funding .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
due to a shortage of funds do you have any plans to review the situation again .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
he has responded to you , but i will allow him to give you another response .
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , it is really difficult to approach them specifically on generalities of adequacy of funding at this stage , given that we are just over half a year into operations right now .
thank you , mr. speaker .

thank you mr. ng .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :

speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister of finance , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i think also a fact that has been brought up , is that those boards carried over some deficits as of april 1 .
we are trying to deal with that and rectify that situation to make sure there &apos;s sufficient funding for the delivery of health and social services programs .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
your last supplementary mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i also would like to ask again , up to april or rather march of the year 2000 , we expect to be in a deficit of 20 million dollars .
i was wondering if this was a fact or an estimate .
could you elaborate for me .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister of finance , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , if the honourable member is speaking about the government of nunavut , we don &apos;t expect to be in a deficit for this current operating year .
and there &apos;s also , by the same token , the matter i indicated earlier of their deficits carried forward as of april 1 , 1999 .

pelly bay gymnasium
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i will direct my question to the minister of education .
i asked this question previously , in regards to the gymnasium in the school .
i know the year 2000 is coming this winter , only a couple of months from now .
i was wondering if your department has plans to build a gymnasium for our school in the up-coming year ?

minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i had written a letter to mr. iyaqsaa , the mayor , in regards to this issue .
i received a letter on october 8 from him .
i was only able to respond by saying that we would be doing a community tour and this was in your capital plan .
the government &apos;s priorities are on the priorities of communities , so i &apos;ll have to speak to him and then i can get back to you and discuss this matter again .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
oral questions .
mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the reason i asked that question is because the previous government i believe set aside some money for the gymnasium and i saw the blue prints that were drawn by the previous government .
the people of pelly bay have been waiting a long time for this gymnasium that was going to be connected to the school .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
your gymnasium is not in those categories but it is within the five year plan .
if there &apos;s still enough support by the people of pelly bay then it will stay within the capital plan .

mr. speaker i don &apos;t believe that we are dealing with a 20 million dollar deficit .
as you know that is one of the figures that has kind of been tossed out there as a potential worst case scenario by my colleague who is not here today .
we are hoping to have that work wrapped up in a couple of weeks and that will give us a better idea of some of the options we might put forward as a government .

consideration in committee of the whole of bills and other matters
chairperson ( mr. puqiqnak ) ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
at this time we &apos;ll go into committee of the whole to discuss bill 2 and 5 .
i would like to ask what the committee &apos;s wish is .
would you like to take a brief break before we go ahead .
minister ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
chairman , it is my understanding that we would get into bill 2 - amendment of the workers &apos; compensation act , but whenever the committee is ready .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
okay , everybody agrees ?
what is the committee &apos;s wish .
did you want to take a brief break before we go ahead .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman , i would just like to go ahead without a break .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
all agreed ?
nays ?
thank you .
i apologize , if you would like to move right into bill 2 then we &apos;ll go ahead .
we &apos;ll open up the floor for debate afterwards .
you want to go ahead to the witness table .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. minister .
bill 2 is in regards to the wcb .
they &apos;re in your white binders , second page .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
do you have any opening remarks ?
we &apos;ll proceed .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
the purpose of the amendment of the workers &apos; compensation act is to address the problem identified with the section dealing with third party actions in motor vehicle accidents .
the difficulty with the section as currently written is that it allows injured workers to sue their own employers and co-workers in motor vehicle related accidents .
this goes against the first principle of workers &apos; compensation legislation that an injured worker cannot sue his or her own employer .
mr. chairman the proposed amendment does not affect the ability of workers to be treated fairly .
workers will continue to be covered by workers &apos; compensation and have access to a series of reviews and appeals if they are not satisfied with the compensation they receive .
mr. chairman , bill 2 is intended to address an unforeseen issue arising from section 12 of the workers &apos; compensation act .
this amendment will ensure that our act is consistent with the principles of workers &apos; compensation across canada .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
did you want one of your staff members to go up there with you at the witness table .
hon. kelvin ng :
yes mr. chairman there are two individuals here from workers &apos; compensation to appear as witnesses .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
okay , if you would go up please .
okay , before they go up i would like to ask the members if our lawyer could also sit up at the witness table if it &apos;s okay with the members .
okay , come up and mr. minister you sit with the wcb people and our legal advisor .
mr. minister , i would like to ask you if you could introduce the workers &apos; compensation board representatives .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
to my right is mr. jerry mire , president of the workers &apos; compensation board .
to my left , mr. michael triggs , legal counsel with the workers &apos; compensation board .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
welcome to the committee of the whole .
we will now open up the floor for discussion on bill 2 .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i apologize my back is to you .
my question is in regards to the issue that you touched upon regarding an automobile accident .
some of the workers have problems .
sometimes they might be able to make more money but they have a lot of barriers created by these bills especially in the smaller communities .
have you considered this problem that &apos;s created in the communities .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister if you would like to respond or if one of the people at the witness table would like to respond to that question .
hon. kelvin ng :
if i understand the question correctly , i &apos;ll try to answer it .
this amendment would not impact on an individuals right to workers &apos; compensation benefits as a result of any work related accident that might take place .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
is this going to affect that in the smaller communities , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
but again that wouldn &apos;t , it &apos;s my understanding that this amendment wouldn &apos;t affect that circumstance .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu .
while we &apos;re considering bill 2 , we &apos;re looking at amendments to bill 2 in regards to the workers &apos; compensation act .
in respect to transportation accidents arising out of and during workers &apos; employment .
any further questions .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
yes , thank you for that clarification .
i have another question in regards to the smaller communities .
there are barely any employment opportunities in the smaller communities and it creates a problem when you &apos;re trying to buy insurance .
especially for the small businesses .
they pay monthly dues on an annual basis or on a monthly basis and they pay out a lot over the year .
that is a problem especially for the smaller communities .
people who are trying to establish small businesses tend to pay all their revenue to the workers &apos; compensation board and nothing comes back to their own business .
is there something we can do to alleviate this problem .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. minister ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
he &apos;s referring to more general matters in regards to workers &apos; compensation premiums , assessments and that , which are geared towards the exposure .
thank you .
chairperson :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
are we making an amendment to the workers &apos; compensation act because the smaller communities are not included .
chairperson :
minister ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
i give it to mr. mire to answer this one .
thank you .
chairperson :
i would like to remind the house and to remind the members that we are following these white binders .
i believe you have a copy in front of you .
we &apos;re following the binders that we have in front of you .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
maybe i &apos;m not making myself clear .
this act will effect a lot of people out there if we agree to this amendment .
like i was saying , the smaller communities have employees even in the smaller communities , everybody out there works , whether it &apos;s a smaller community or not .
chairperson :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. minister are you going to be responding to that .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
please wait while i go with the names i have .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
i think there will be other times where we can discuss in general the concerns that we have about premiums and payments and issues in general about workers &apos; compensation .
my first question would be relating to other jurisdictions , we &apos;re looking at changing this .
is that fair to say .
mr. mire :
perhaps , as an example ...
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
one moment please , as the chair , i would like you to recognize the chair before you make your comments .
only after you recognize the chair , i &apos;ll give you the go-ahead .
i apologize , i cannot say your name .
if you would go ahead please .
mr. mire :
thank you mr. chairman .
my name is mire .
if i may provide an example for the member .
in paying those assessments , he also protects any other workers who work for him from liability as a result of that accident involving his worker .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. mire .
i think that &apos;s how you pronounce your name .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. mire .
mr. mire :
if there are injured workers , they will always be covered no matter who may be ultimately liable for any harm that was caused to them .
chairperson :
thank you . mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
it &apos;s really a duplication by having this in there , you &apos;re paying twice .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. mire .
mr. mire :
mr. chairman , yes there is that potential and you &apos;re correct in assuming that this legislation would avoid that possibility .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. o &apos;brien
mr. o &apos;brien :
one last question , if i &apos;m not mistaken , we changed this , made this amendment to the act when we were the gnwt .
i think i recall being involved in that for that very reason but now that we &apos;re nunavut , we have to change it again for this government .
how does it relate to other jurisdictions . are we the only ones or one of the few that have this double standard in the act .
chairperson :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien . , mr. mire , if you can respond .
mr. mire :
thank you mr. chairman .
the way the legislation reads now would make it different from any other jurisdiction in canada .
the way we are proposing to amend it would make it similar to a majority of other jurisdictions in canada .
not all jurisdictions will have legislation which reads exactly the same as this .
but it is safe to say that the smaller jurisdictions in canada will all have legislation similar to what we &apos;re asking you to make yours into .
thank you .
chairperson :
thank you . mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
mr. chairman this is my last question .
i agree with this amendment and i &apos;ll be supporting it , i &apos;m just curious . i know we inherited the various acts and regulations from the gnwt when we became nunavut .
if we did , that amendment would be included , so why are we doing it again .
thank you .
chairperson :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. mire .
mr. mire :
the act which you inherited actually , the amendment to which the member is referring was passed by the gnwt in november of 1998 and it was that amendment which created the problem .
that problem has since been corrected by the gnwt when it passed an amendment the same as this one in september , just a month ago .
the problem has been corrected in the nwt and it remains for this government to deal with .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
i was going to make a point of order , we aren &apos;t going to be dealing with the workers &apos; compensation act , it &apos;s huge .
this is just an amendment .
if you look at the summary , i wanted to make a point of order to mr. iqaqrialu , he was asking questions that are contained in the whole act .
if he would like to get into the workers &apos; compensation act in full he could look into that and he could also use a private member &apos;s bill .
this is an amendment to the workers &apos; compensation act and mr. ng read the summary , the purpose .
perhaps if we keep on that line we can complete this in no time .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
that was just a comment and a point of order .
thank you , mr. arvaluk .
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. arvaluk said what i was going to say .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you for the clarification .
mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
so now i understand what we &apos;re dealing with at this point .
i myself don &apos;t like the contents of the whole workers &apos; compensation act because some of the clauses are a barrier to some of the smaller communities .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
is that your question .
can one of the people down here respond , because he asked the question that in the smaller communities there are many barriers that we face in this act .
i think that mr. iqaqrialu is asking whether it &apos;s going to have an impact on his concerns .
can you respond to his concern please .
hon. kelvin ng :
the independent board of directors sets those premiums based on advice they get on expectations of accident rates and that type of thing .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :

adoption of the inuit employment plan
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , article 23 of the nunavut land claims agreement is a very important article for nunavummiut .
it stipulates that the government of nunavut is required to increase inuit participation in the public service to represent the ratio of inuit in the total population of nunavut .
mr. speaker , as a newly formed government we have already made progress , but we do realize that we face many challenges in achieving our goal of a representative public service .
mr. speaker , the iep developed by the oic contains a number of strategic initiatives to make it easier for nunavummiut to gain positive employment with the government .

their first meeting was october 1st , 2nd and 3rd .
the council held it &apos;s much anticipated founding conference in rankin inlet and featured plain language workshops as well as a gala evening hosted by peter gzowski .
new board members from across nunavut gathered on friday evening for the first annual general meeting .
congratulations to the newly elected board of directors .
the board was pleased to welcome yvette sokay from the national literacy secretariat , human resource development council to the conference to say a few words about the beginning of the nunavut literacy council .
the nunavut literacy council promotes reading and writing in the official languages of nunavut through literacy programs and resource development as well as support to literacy projects and practitioners .

mr. kilabuk .
minister &apos;s statement 25 - 1 ( 3 ) :
polar bear management
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker i rise today to speak on an issue of great importance to our harvesters in nunavut ;
the responsibility we have in managing two thirds of the world &apos;s polar bears .
polar bear management is a responsibility we share with the hunters of nunavut and the nunavut wildlife management board .
two primary principles by which polar bears are managed in nunavut are conservation and sustainable harvesting .
these principles are enshrined in the nunavut land claims agreement and they are principles by which our ancestors ensured we would have polar bears to hunt today .
the results of these studies are discussed with communities and used along with our inuit qaujimajatuqangit as a basis for making management decisions .
( interpretation ) mr. speaker , the handling of bears during research has raised questions about the impact of such activities on the bears themselves .
i take these concerns very seriously and i have directed my department staff to ensure our handling methods are closely monitored during each field session .
the memoranda of understanding are now four years old and it is time to start examining their success .
where necessary they will be revised to reflect the new information available to us .
this is a task that i expect will take several years to review properly .
i also want to say , while recognizing these memoranda of understanding are in need of complete review , these mou &apos;s are extremely important for the joint management of polar bears .
the memoranda of understanding serve to demonstrate to the rest of the world that nunavut as a whole is committed to the sustainable use of its &apos; wildlife resources .
but there are concerns about these memoranda of understanding amongst our hunters and i want to say today that these concerns have not gone unheard .
( interpretation ends ) mr. speaker , we also must not forget that many of our bears cross provincial and territorial boundaries and international borders .
we cannot effectively manage our polar bear population without co-ordinating our activities with our neighbours .
so i have asked department officials to begin pursuing the development of formal management agreements with these jurisdictions .
( interpretation ends ) mr. speaker , i reiterate my commitment to incorporate inuit qaujimajatuqangit into my department &apos;s decision making .
managing our polar bears in a sustainable manner can only be achieved by using a blend of the best practices of modern science and the extensive knowledge of our hunters .

y2k - government of nunavut is ready
hon. jack anawak :
thank you , mr. speaker .
as you are aware the millennium is coming in a few months and we all have concerns about the effect of the millennium bug , also known as y2k .
nunavut emergency services , under the department of community government and transportation have been working with the federal , provincial and territorial governments since early in 1999 .
on april 1 , terc moved to include nunavut government representatives as well .
deputy ministers have assigned staff to ensure each government of nunavut department is represented on terc .
each month they meet to discuss their progress on y2k compliance .
the federal government along with the provinces and territories have produced several information packages .
public information is also available through the internet .
website addresses and other detailed information are available through nunavut emergency services in the department of community government and transportation or one of the designated departmental representatives .
nunavut is better prepared than many other jurisdictions to deal with any disruptions that may occur due to the millennium bug .
due to our isolation , nunavut is supplied annually with non-perishable goods and fuel .
the power corporation has assured us that there will be no unexpected y2k related power interruptions .
nunavut emergency services , the rcmp , the department of national defence and northwestel have community contingency plans in place or being finalized .
the contingency plans include regular time communication checks with each nunavut community to ensure no disruptions occur .
although we anticipate no disruptions , the territorial emergency response committee will ensure we are ready in the event of any unforeseen problems .

council of people with disabilities
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i am pleased to advise the house today about the council for people with disabilities and the disabilities initiatives taken by our government .
( interpretation ends ) people with disabilities continue to find themselves without equal access .
this causes isolation , lack of self-esteem and contributes to poverty .
people with disabilities want to benefit from the programs and services that government has to offer and want input into how these services can be best delivered .
( interpretation ) a council was formed to provide a unified voice for people with disabilities and act as a lobby group for equal access .
this council for people with disabilities has also recently applied for society status .
there is not a high degree of public awareness in nunavut about people with disabilities .
the council for people with disabilities and the department of culture , language , elders &amp; youth are working together towards a number of goals .
the council has provided us with a number of recommendations i would like to mention .
( interpretation ends ) these recommendations are to increase awareness and accessibility .
these recommendations are that government should work together to provide information , education , training , and employment opportunities for people with disabilities ;
to ensure access to housing is available for people with disabilities ;
to develop public awareness programs ;
to help eliminate barriers that people with disabilities experience in schools , work and community life ;
to make our public buildings and transportation accessible to people with disabilities ;
to provide government information in multiple formats and languages to ensure the maximum participation of nunavut residents with disabilities ;
to ensure the provision of technology training and information in multiple formats for participants with disabilities in the nunavut education system and workplace .
this will pave the way for ensuring relevant and cost-effective services , funding and access for all nunavut residents with disabilities and we will do our best to help in this area .

mr. speaker , yesterday the premier of the nunavut government tabled a document on the single time zone .
today mr. speaker i rise to thank him on behalf of the kitikmeot and natillingmiut .
i would like to appreciate and acknowledge the fact that we are going to have a single time zone .
mr. speaker , we felt that we needed a single time zone , iqaluit was quite far from us and it being the capital , we now see that our concerns were considered .
we are happy to see a single time zone proposed .
mr. speaker our hours are so staggered in nunavut it is hard to work together .
it is evident that once we get a single time zone , the regions will not all be happy , especially the baffin region .
i would like to acknowledge the fact , mr. speaker , the nunavut territory will now have a single time zone and this will help all the staff to work together .

sanikiluaq &apos;s opposition to time change
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
we don &apos;t want to be talking about this same issue forever but i feel the need to say something about the single time zone .
mr. speaker , the community of sanikiluaq , that i represent , do not want to go on to central time because in the community many of the residents are harvesters .
we also have a lot of school children .
if we go back by two hours it is going to effect the harvesters , the hunters and the students .
the people of sanikiluaq are opposed to going back two hours .
we are not opposed to the single time zone proposal but there has to be a compromise .
what we are proposing is that keewatin stay on the same time , kitikmeot go forward and baffin go back one hour .
that would be a compromise that would suit everyone for the whole of nunavut .

difference between tenders and rfps
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
this is a return to an oral question that was asked by hunter tootoo on october 21 , 1999 .
i would like to make a reply ( interpretation ends ) to define what the difference between a tender and a request for a proposal is .
my apologies to the members for not responding verbally at the time the question was asked .
i misunderstood the question that was posed by mr. tootoo and thought he was looking for a formal , legal definition of an rfp or tender .
mr. speaker , i am pleased to advise mr. tootoo and all the members of the legislature that a request for proposals is a request for proposed solutions to a defined need or problem .
it is not an offer , but only contemplates an offer .
the receipt of a proposal is not an acceptance and does not result in a contract .
on the other hand , a call to tender , is the beginning of a contract and must result in a contract .
when the government tenders , they know what they need and are shopping for the best price for the goods or services they require .
if any member of the legislative assembly would like further examples or clarification please do not hesitate to contact me and i will be pleased to expand or help in any way .

disaster compensation policy
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na uqaqti .
the effect on these people is devastating because a lot of them don &apos;t have secondary incomes .
my question today is to the minister responsible .
does this government have any kind of disaster relief program to compensate hunters , trappers and fishermen for acts of god .

minister responsible for ikupiktullirijiit mr. kilabuk .

mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na uqaqti .
it is reassuring to hear that .
i am sure the honourable minister will bring that forward quite soon .
but in this policy will there be a compensation package to replace snowmobiles or boats or motors , things like that .
will that be looked at and will that be in this compensation package .

speaker ( interpretation ) :
ma &apos;na mr. mclean .

however , we do recognize the importance of it and are trying to facilitate expanding the financial services that are available in our communities .
i can &apos;t say definitively when the banks will report back .

dead bowhead whales
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i have another question for the minister of sustainable development .
as we have heard in the past around the hall beach and igloolik areas there have been bowhead whales killed by killer whales and nobody has been voicing that concern .
perhaps if these killer whales were human beings it would be viewed by all the people of the world .
i was wondering what you are going to be doing with these whales that have been killed .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister for sustainable development .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i just want to explain that marine mammals are not under the jurisdiction of the nunavut government .
the federal government department of fisheries and oceans have that jurisdiction .
the information i have received to date is that killer whales have been killing bowhead whales .
i can tell you our department has no jurisdiction .
speaker :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
perhaps the nunavut government should write a letter making a recommendation to get killer whale numbers reduced .
we use those animals for our subsistence , and we do not like to see them depleted by another animal .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
minister for sustainable development , mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :

contaminated fuel
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question is to the minister responsible for petroleum products .
mr. speaker some time ago my colleague from gjoa haven raised an issue about bad gas in their community and the effect it had on their snow machines and other vehicles .
mr. speaker , i use my colleagues example for the reason that if this situation has not been resolved it may effect other communities such as mine .
i am wondering if the minister can explain to us the outcome of the study that was done on the fuel and what the proposed solutions were .
thank you .

hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :

this was a concern in gjoa haven and we dealt with this issue for a long time and did some tests .
my staff have had discussions with various snowmobile owners and looked for some solutions to the problem .
they were also asking the users what kind of modifications would be needed on snowmobiles .
the reports are back and we have heard this on the radio also , we are working on it and there are no other concerns in regards to the problem that we had earlier .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :

mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :

mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :

to respond to that question , i think we have to have a clear understanding .
we are not going to make changes on our own , it will be through consulting with the communities .
we will include the communities through consultations with the public so that we &apos;ll have a better understanding .
i would also like to say mr. speaker , that the wildlife regulations which we inherited from the government of the northwest territories are quite old .
they will have an effect on us and we are having a review done mr. speaker .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
this spring in june , i asked a question about the harvesting of male polar bears only , which effects our lifestyles and the polar bear species .
when the male population of polar bears is overpopulated , when the young male polar bears become overpopulated , it &apos;s not going to be too good for the polar bears .

question 67 - 1 ( 3 ) :
cost of living increase for income support
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na uqaqti .
it &apos;s a statistic but it &apos;s not a healthy statistic for nunavut .
it &apos;s a fact of life for a lot of people .
my question to the minister responsible is , has there been a cost of living increase for social assistance recipients in nunavut in the last couple of years .
ma &apos;na uqaqti .
speaker :
ma &apos;na mr. mclean .
( interpretation ) thank you mr. mclean .
as this is an issue from our previous government , i will give the minister of education , mr. arvaluk , the option to respond to the question or not .
hon. james arvaluk : ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
yes there have been increases from what i &apos;ve heard from the past government .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. arvaluk .

hon. james arvaluk :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my statement on the mandate for the review committee said that it will allow significant review and recommendations to my department .
some of the review i hope will focus on community involvement through the one window approach to program delivery , including employment counselling .
moving from dependence to self-sufficiency from the government ;
priorities ; addressing the social needs of residents of nunavut ;
and fiscal responsibility of the government budget .
all these have to be looked at before we can commit on what changes they will be contemplating and how much they &apos;re contemplating increases .
because it &apos;s a canadian standard we really don &apos;t know if in fact it reflects the reality of social requirements in nunavut .

question 68 - 1 ( 3 ) :
lack of aviation fuel
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is directed to the minister of pol .
the two communities in my riding don &apos;t have aviation fuel available in the community .
i was wondering if you could make aviation fuel available in my communities .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i don &apos;t quite understand your question .
thank you .
speaker : ( interpretation ) :
perhaps rephrase your question .
mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is about aviation fuel .
this fuel is available in most communities but pelly bay and repulse bay don &apos;t have it available .
the reason i &apos;m asking this question is because when we were coming from baker lake last spring , we chartered a plane going to my riding .
we could not land in uqsuqtuq and pelly bay because they did not have aviation fuel .
we had problems because although we wanted to land in repulse bay , we could not because there is no aviation fuel available there .
speaker :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i apologize for not understanding your question at first .
i &apos;ll take your questions as notice .

housing for social worker
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is directed to the minister of community government and transportation .
speaker :
thank you mr. akesuk .
minister responsible for housing , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
we worked on this issue as i stated before , and i was supposed to respond and i apologize for not giving you a response right away .
in kimmirut the social worker doesn &apos;t have housing available .
i was asked if i could provide housing for the social worker .
the health centre has three units .
that person might have room there , so we could ask this question to the minister responsible for health and social services .
the government unit is so old they can &apos;t use it at this point and it requires a lot of repairs .
perhaps the minister for health and social services can respond to your question because we believe that there is space available at the health centre .
thank you , mr. speaker .

question 70 - 1 ( 3 ) :
health board deficit
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
yesterday during oral question period , i asked a question to the minister of finance .
i will be asking the same question as i did yesterday .
the health boards are running in a deficit situation and once we dissolve the boards of health and social services , we will inherit their deficit .
but in the year 2000 , in the main estimates , will you be making proposals to pay for the deficit .

question 71 - 1 ( 3 ) :
management of polar bears
mr. kattuk :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i will be directing my question to the minister of sustainable development .
this morning you made a statement about polar bear management .
for five years , our agreement was in place and sometimes we ran into a problems because inuit traditional knowledge was contrary to some of the management plans .
the communities would prefer to use their knowledge and their culture and traditions and i was wondering if your department is going to use traditional knowledge .
that &apos;s my question to mr. kilabuk .
speaker :
thank you mr. kattuk .
just a reminder that i don &apos;t want you to mention the ministers &apos; names .
minister responsible for sustainable development , mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
for example , these communities do manage the populations in their zone because we have a memorandum of understanding for the different polar bear management zones .
we have heard about the problems and that they want to review the mou with the communities .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. kilabuk .
oral questions . mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
perhaps i need to rephrase my question .
i &apos;ll use an example .
in the james bay area during the polar bear study , the sanikiluaq residents &apos; quota was reduced after the polar bears were surveyed .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you , minister responsible for sustainable development .
hon. peter kilabuk :
thank you , mr. speaker .
these mou &apos;s are very important .
the department of sustainable development will have to consider these and nwmb will have to be involved too because we have co-management .

they may be seeking some government of nunavut assistance in that regard but to date we haven &apos;t seen anything on paper .
we &apos;re just aware that there might be a possibility of that happening .

bill 6 - an act to amend the access to information and protection of privacy act
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker , honourable members .
mr. speaker , the gnwt passed the access to information and protection to privacy act in 1994 .
the act came into force on december 31 , 1996 .
the act was then inherited by the nunavut government on april 1st of this year .
this fall they passed an act to amend the act which amended 10 separate pieces of legislation .
mr. speaker , the government of nunavut feels strongly that this assembly should not just automatically copy what was done in the government of northwest territories .
we believe that this assembly and nunavut &apos;s access and privacy commissioner should be involved in the process of determining what acts should prevail over the atip act and which should not .
mr. speaker , unfortunately as the act is now written , these decisions must be made and amendments enacted before december 31st , 1999 .
bill 6 will extend the december 31st deadline by one year .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
the motion is in order . to the principles of the bill .
question has been called .

mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .

chairperson ( interpretation ) :

perhaps minister ng would like to go to the witness table or would you prefer to sit on your seat there ?
hon. kelvin ng :
perhaps i &apos;ll just give the opening comments and then move to the witness table and bring forward the witnesses that are appropriate .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) : go ahead minister ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
mr. chairman , the purpose of the loan authorization act is to facilitate lending to municipalities .
it will benefit municipalities which may not have the ability to borrow from commercial lenders .
the loan authorization act sets the upper limit for municipal loans for the 1999 / 2000 fiscal year at 10 million dollars .
to date we have committed 5.2 million dollars to two municipalities ;
iqaluit $ 5 million dollars for the construction of a new sub-division and clyde river $ 200 thousand dollars to meet on-going commitments until the fiscal review of that community is completed .
mr. chairman , the government is requesting a loan limit of $ 10 million dollars to ensure that we may be able to meet the needs that may arise in other municipalities .
if requirements do not materialize loans will not be made .
loans are advanced only after careful scrutiny by the departments of community governments &amp; transportation and finance and administration .
only applications from mayors are recommended to the minister of finance and administration for approval .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister ng .
are you in agreement .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :

mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i have a question if that &apos;s ok .
i would like you to clarify the loan authorization act for me , thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
perhaps the minister can re-phrase his opening remarks .
hon. kelvin ng :
mr. chairman this loan authorization act is specific , it &apos;s only to allow the government to lend to municipalities not to direct individuals or businesses under this act .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
at least now i understand .
thank you .
chairman ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
it states here that you have made a loan to clyde river to meet on-going commitments and here in the inuktitut translation it says for the construction of a new sub-division .
when you were reading your presentation you stated it was to meet on-going commitments until the fiscal review of that community is completed .
so could you elaborate on that because in the translations in inuktitut it states otherwise .

mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :

i apologize .
the next speaker is mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
a question to the minister of finance .
chairperson ( interpretation ) : thank you mr. nutarak .
i have to apologize for the inuktitut document here .
for the construction of a new sub-division , mr. iqaqrialu had a question on that because of the inuktitut document .
mr. iqaqrialu just wanted to make a point because the translation on the document is missing .
i just wanted to make that clear .
if you understand now we &apos;ll get to mr. nutarak &apos;s question .
perhaps the minister can respond .
hon. kelvin ng :
in respect to mr. nutarak &apos;s question .
as i indicated in my opening statement if there is no need then the money won &apos;t be lent .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng . mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
sometimes i can hardly see my button here .
thank you mr. chairman .
the remaining 4.8 is left over from the 10 million dollars ? is the remaining money , the 10 thousand 4.8 million dollars already committed prior to march 31 ?

just a few comments mr. minister .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
i can &apos;t , i don &apos;t have the information in respect to what their ceiling amount was , the gnwt ceiling on their loan authorization act .
i can tell you the amounts they advanced last year ; they advanced 1 million dollars in all to municipalities under their loans .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman given our tight financial situation or our almost embarrassing financial situation here in nunavut with the health care and education and housing and so on .
how can the minister justify expending ten million dollars for these various projects given the financial bind that we find ourselves in .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman for the record , first of all this isn &apos;t a grant or contribution , this is a loan authorization . the money has to come back to the government of nunavut .
it &apos;s to assist municipalities because of various reasons for their financial needs they may not be able to access commercial lending for whatever circumstance that the application would come forward from municipalities .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman what is the time-line or the time-frame for these , for example in iqaluit there &apos;s 5 million dollars committed .
what is the time-frame for this money to be returned to the government of nunavut .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
perhaps the minister would like to respond .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman each loan application includes a repayment schedule that is worked out based on negotiations with the municipality and the recommendations that come from the official that screened each of the applications .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
but we can find 10 million dollars to loan out and it may not be for the 20 twenty years but i &apos;m sure it will be at least 10 years .
i &apos;m just not sure this is the best use of our money given the fact that we &apos;re in a bind financially and this is not a slight on iqaluit or anybody else .
i just think that our money could be better spent at this time .
if we were in a flush situation where there was a lot of money and we were well established , i could see it .
but i do have difficulty with this and my question would be how is the minister going to allocate the second 5 million dollars ?
if he could give some guidelines on how the projects will be selected and whether the regular members will have any input into this selection process ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
minister .
hon. kelvin ng :
mr. chairman , i &apos;d like to reiterate , this isn &apos;t an expenditure , this is a loan that the government is putting out .
there is an big distinction between giving out money like a grant or contribution versus lending out money to the municipalities .
mr. chairman , i &apos;m trying to stay away from the broader issue of government of nunavut financing based on the member trying to expound on health needs .
again , i would say that it has to go through a screening process of officials .
there are representatives , specifically , it has to come forward from community government and transportation which deals primarily with municipalities ;
finance is involved obviously because of the analysis of the risk and repayment schedules .
there &apos;s criteria in respect to conformance with the towns and villages act to authorize municipalities to borrow .
there &apos;s repayment terms that have to be specified .
there &apos;s assessment , as i indicated , on the repayment ability of the borrower and the security as well .
it was tied specifically to the land development needs of the town of iqaluit because it was growing at such a quick pace because of iqaluit becoming the capital .
so land development is an issue that allows for more housing in the capital .
it allows more people because of more private development , it actually takes some of the pressure off some the government of nunavut needs for staff housing .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
mr. chairman , it &apos;s not my intent to agitate the minister .
you talk about the situation you brought up about iqaluit and the need for the expansion of land development , there &apos;s certainly many communities that have that similar situation .
i question the rationale at this point in time .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. minister .
hon. kelvin ng :
i think it &apos;s important to remember that this is available to all municipalities .
there have been in fact , past municipalities that have borrowed with the gnwt in respect directly to land development .
if we required some borrowing for the government of nunavut , certainly that can be done .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
that &apos;s all i have to say .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i think that was just a comment .
did you want to make a response mr. minister .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , first of all let me reassure all members of this house that it &apos;s not the intent of the government to circumvent any of the processes here .
when the legislation came forward as you all know , from the government of the northwest territories to nunavut , there was an assumption made that the authorization act was one of them .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
mr. chairman , in regards to this loan authorization act , i would like to approve it because the nunavut government will be helping out the hamlets in the nunavut area .
that was just a comment .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
we realize , and i don &apos;t want to sound like i &apos;m picking on the capital , but there &apos;s unparalleled economic growth in this community .
i can attest to the homeless shelter here and the people that are in it because they can &apos;t find affordable housing in iqaluit .
that could be for different reasons and i know probably that iqaluit is stretched for dollars to build a subdivision this year .
and we all know that iqaluit will probably double in population in the next four to five years .
we know that .
it &apos;s growth , it &apos;s the capital and there &apos;s going to be more pressure put on this government to bring them up to the standards that other capital cities have .
and that gets into where we &apos;re going next year , and the years following .
i have no problems with this loan authorization act , i think it &apos;s a useful tool in communities and i &apos;ve lived in them for the last 28 years .
and that &apos;s happened probably in more cases than enough .
then this loan authorization act will come and appease the banks and the municipality gets a debt reduction plan back on line with the help of municipal and community affairs .
my reluctance on this one , and it &apos;s general reluctance , and i &apos;m not picking on the capital , but when does it stop .
is there going to be a point where we say no to iqaluit if it &apos;s 10 million dollars next year , 5 million and 5 million .
but , i think we can utilize that money in different areas and housing seems to be one .
and there &apos;s nothing wrong with the government guaranteeing a loan for a municipality if we go that far .
that &apos;s my fear .
i want it to be used where the need is most .
and we hear that all the time .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
minister .
hon. kelvin ng :
mr. chairman , just to reiterate again , this isn &apos;t a direct cash expenditure from the perspective of coming out of our operating and maintenance funds .
it shows up that you advanced it , it &apos;s out there as a loan , is outstanding which is a receivable .
i want to stress that this is a loan .
it &apos;s all repayable and i can appreciate the members comments about when does it stop .
but right now i can &apos;t speak about what their future needs are or any municipalities future needs for that matter .
we can only deal with what comes to us in this current fiscal year mr. chairman .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
listening to the comments from the members of the legislative assembly , i &apos;m very envious that they &apos;re financially well off . i &apos;m very envious that they make comments like that .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
minister ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
again , i have another question .
if we approve this act , will the nunavut communities or hamlets be given a copy of this act so they know that there are loans available from the nunavut government ?
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. minister .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;d necessarily give them a copy of the act but through community government and transportation , their staff would deal with the municipalities .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you . mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
when we were still under the gnwt , the department of maca never got that information out to the communities .
if we &apos;re going to be submitting this to community government and transportation and if that information isn &apos;t given out to the communities , they won &apos;t know that this loan is available .
are we going to be getting this information out there so that they &apos;ll know there &apos;s money available .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
just for further clarification , we &apos;re discussing bill 1 and we &apos;re not going to be getting into the fine details .
the question here now is the loan authorization act and sending the information out there is not part of the discussion .
i would like to go back to bill 1 .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman , i understand exactly where you &apos;re coming from and i &apos;m glad that you made that comment .
during my term , i know that i &apos;ll be a part of reviewing these acts .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
any further comments or questions ?
i believe that we may not have a quorum .
nancy , if you could count the members . we &apos;ll take a ten minute break because we don &apos;t have a quorum .
&gt; &gt; short recess
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
we can proceed with our session .
mr. iqaqrialu do you have any more comments .
go ahead .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i just wanted to make another comment .
i know that our community has been running in a deficit situation for quite some time now .
i especially want to say that when you pay part of your loan or your deficit , only part of it , your deficit starts to accumulate .
on top of your deficit the interest starts building and your deficit starts building up if you don &apos;t pay the bill in whole .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. minister .
hon. kelvin ng :
so if there is a desire to prepay or pay in advance , or accelerate the payments that is certainly something we would be more than happy to accommodate .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i will try and elaborate again .
so the interest accumulates when we don &apos;t pay for our loan according to the procedure .
when the municipality proposes to pay back the loan all at one time it is easier and it is not as dangerous .
so perhaps i made myself clear for now .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. minister would you like to respond .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman . mr. chairman , just to advise members that when the government lends out money under this act we charge a lower interest rate than the commercial institutions would .
in the case of municipalities , to meet whatever needs they have based on specific proposals that they have for loans .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i don &apos;t want to be the only one taking the floor and i apologize for having the floor .
that is creating the problem for the hamlet council who owe money to financial institutions and also to the government .
i hope that is clear .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i believe there is a response , mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
i know exactly where mr. iqaqrialu is coming from .
when we help the hamlets , of course we give out loans to some of the hamlets , that was the policy of the government of the nwt .
we have to help the communities because they might go bankrupt .
we give financial support to the hamlets and the nunavut government and the hamlet councils work together so that they can repay their loan .
it is good when they have one loan but then there are always unforeseen expenditures that might come up .
so we might possibly review their loan again .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i have no more names on my list so if there are no further questions , we &apos;ll go clause by clause .
is that the committee &apos;s wish .

mr. akesuk would like to go onto the next item .
bill 4 , minister of sustainable development .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
we can &apos;t hear you very well without the ear aids .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
would the minister like to make a presentation regarding bill 4 . mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
my colleague is having a hard time finding his paper .
it is bill 4 .
my colleague can &apos;t find his pages , could you wait one minute please .
thank you .
i am going to be saying the same thing that i said this morning .
this is in regards to the legal services board .
there is one and they work for nunavut , but their present name is the nwt legal services board .
the purpose of this bill is to amend the legal services act to provide for a nunavut legal services board to start on april 1 , 2000 .
the staffing process for the executive director position is currently underway and once that is done other staff will be hired and the office itself will be set up in gjoa haven .
the plan is to have the office staffed and operational prior to april 1 , 2000 .
the standing committee on community empowerment and sustainable development made certain recommendations to alter the draft legislation prior to it &apos;s introduction to the legislature .
i have made those changes to this bill as requested by the standing committee .
the standing committee &apos;s second recommendation refers to the clause that enables the minister to appoint up to two additional members to the board .
the recommendation states that there be up to three additional members instead of two .
those are the reasons i didn &apos;t make those changes .
this bill to amend the legal services act is very important because it is a reflection of our governments commitment to take full responsibility for our affairs .
nunavut needs it &apos;s own legal services board .
finally , bill 4 is consistent with our commitment to put in place structures that meet the needs of the people of nunavut .
thank you mr. chairman .
i can move up to the witness table if you would like .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak , you can continue and if you have staff that you would like to invite .
thank you for going to the witness table .
if you introduce your staff first of all .
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , on my left is nora sanders , she is my deputy minister for the department of justice and on my right mark spakowski who reviews the legislation .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
welcome .
i now open the floor for comments or questions .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
in your opening statements you said that a lawyer would be appointed on the nomination of the law society of nunavut .
my question then on this issue is in regards to inuit qaujimajatuqangit .
we have stated that we were going to start implementing inuit qaujimajatuqangit and inuit qaujimajatuqangit is not well known by lawyers .
we would like to start implementing inuit qaujimajatuqangit .
how are you going to implement inuit qaujimajatuqangit into the legal system .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
this could be used to start implementing inuit qaujimajatuqangit but we need one lawyer from the nunavut law society to nominate a lawyer to sit on that board .
the rest of the board members would be from the communities and they don &apos;t necessarily need to be lawyers .
they won &apos;t be lawyers .
this legal services board , for example , the nwt legal services board has some inuit and a lawyer .
there might possibly be four or five board members who would be from the nunavut communities .
not necessarily lawyers , we would appoint these persons with inuit qaujimajatuqangit in mind .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
questions or comments .
if there is nothing further .
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
because we are two territories now i am sure that there will be a reduction in staff .
how much reduction will there be .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
yes , our staff , i apologize , our staff will stay in nunavut even if we split up on april 1 , 2000 .
there &apos;s going to be no change in the number .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
that &apos;s it mr. puqiqnak .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
i want to thank the minister for considering the recommendations that the standing committee made regarding this particular issue .
even though the minister didn &apos;t totally accept all of the recommendations , he did go half way .
we appreciate that .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
with the legal services board we will think about your recommendations but we will always give you an opportunity to make your comments before we make appointments .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
any further comments .
if there are no further comments we will go clause by clause .
is that the committee &apos;s wish .

minister &apos;s statement 29 - 1 ( 3 ) :
budget update
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
today i have the pleasure of providing the legislative assembly and the people of nunavut with an update on the fiscal position of our government .
mr. speaker , it is critical for nunavut &apos;s future that we manage our resources wisely .
our fiscal plan recognized the need for the nunavut government to be fiscally responsible and clearly committed to delivering needed services to our people within a balanced budget .
i am pleased to inform members that over the past six months many people have worked tirelessly to make nunavut &apos;s start successful .
this included ensuring our fiscal goals were realized .
we set this standard knowing that if we do things well , nunavut will have a better future .
overall revenues for 1999 / 2000 are expected to be 1.77 million dollars higher than at the time of the budget .
while our tax system will generate less revenue than we anticipated , these reductions will be more than offset by increases in the fiscal transfers from the government of canada .
mr. speaker , total expenditures for 99 / 2000 are currently expected to be 10.3 million dollars less than originally budgeted .
most departments are projecting modest expenditure savings for fiscal year 99 / 2000 .
these savings are generally attributed to unfilled positions and associated operating costs such as travel .
mr. speaker , i would also like to note that we face a number of significant expenditure pressures , including health board deficits .
these pressures are expected to offset the additional revenues , the lower departmental operating spending and the balance of our 10 million contingency reserve .
we have funded strategic initiatives through this reserve , like the nunavut nursing program and the nunavut teachers &apos; education program .
in closing , mr. speaker , i would like to reiterate our government &apos;s commitment to managing our resources wisely .
a balanced budget in our first year is a significant contribution for our future .
by acting in a responsible manner we will ensure a better future for nunavut .
thank you mr. speaker .

minister &apos;s statement 30 - 1 ( 3 ) :
elders in nunavut
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i am glad for this opportunity to speak with the members of the house on the very important topic of elders .
before i begin , i would like to thank our elders for their hard work , continuing guidance and contributions of wisdom and knowledge .
( interpretation ends ) in a previous statement to the house , i explained how elders are a very special group of people in our inuit society .
our culture is a verbal one .
we never had a writing system .
our knowledge of our language and our culture was passed on through generations of inuit over thousands of years .
( interpretation ) our elders are our living history .
their knowledge is filled with inuktitut and inuinnaqtun words that are unknown to our younger society .
( interpretation ends ) our elders can also guide us in the development of this new government .
their wisdom and insight contributes to our understanding of ourselves and our inuit ways .
much of their knowledge still needs to be told .
the importance of oral tradition and knowledge learned from our elders has directed my department &apos;s organization and mandate .
our culture and heritage division will support and encourage services for elders .
it is through the programs in this division that we will be able to provide funding and assistance for the elders of nunavut .
( interpretation ) we have established numerous positions in the organizational structure of our department that will deal specifically with elders concerns and the preservation of their knowledge .
we have just received approval of our organizational chart and are now able to hire the senior advisor for elders and an ethnologist .
the senior advisor for elders will be able to research the needs of the elders in the communities and develop strategies for addressing their needs .
( interpretation ends ) the ethnologist will work to preserve oral tradition , record oral history and support the senior advisor in the development of programs and services for elders .
there will also be an inuit qaujimajatuqangit co-ordinator who will work with the senior advisor for elders and the ethnologists .
they will work towards the practical application of our elders &apos; knowledge in the government .
i want to stress that we are working very hard to establish our department and are making elders our priority .
we have begun the process of gathering and recording inuit qaujimajatuqangit ;
we have attended elders conferences to listen to the concerns and direction of our elders ;
we have started consulting elders on the development of our department and the government as a whole .
we know the knowledge of the elders is a valuable asset and must be treated as such in policy development and program implementation .
we know that we must bridge the gap between the past , present and future by continuing our initiatives in co-ordinating youth and elders activities .
we know that elders have many special needs .
in addition to working with them we must also provide them with support .
we must continue to ensure their honoured place in our society .
because we value , cherish and respect our elders we are working to include them in all of the initiatives of our department .
we would like to encourage other departments in the government to consider ways they could do the same and to co-ordinate these efforts with our government &apos;s inuit qaujimajatuqangit initiatives .
again , mr. speaker , i would like to thank you for the opportunity to speak on our commitment to the elders of nunavut .
thank you mr. speaker .
&gt; &gt; applause
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. havioyak .
before i recognize another speaker i would like to remind people that the gallery is quite small in size .
for the elders who have no seat , you can sit down on the inner seats inside the gallery .

minister &apos;s statement 31 - 1 ( 3 ) :
millennium scholarship
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
today i will finally speak in english and tomorrow i will speak french .
( interpretation ends ) it is with pleasure that i share this scholarship information with members .
i will sign a 10 year agreement with the canadian millennium scholarship foundation representing some 2.3 million dollars in additional funds for student financial assistance .
the agreement between the government of nunavut and the foundation creates two classes of awards .
general awards and exceptional merit awards .
approximately 76 general awards will be given each year to nunavut residents , representing more than 228 thousand dollars a year .
this corresponds to nunavut &apos;s share of the canadian population , the basis on which the foundation negotiated all agreements across canada .
general awards will have a value of 3 thousand dollars .
all nunavut students who apply for financial assistance under the canada and nunavut student loans program for the academic year 1999 / 2000 will automatically be considered for the foundation &apos;s general award .
the first nunavut general awards will be distributed by our government in early 2000 .
the agreement also provides for the creation of three exceptional merit awards to be given each year to nunavut students .
exceptional merit awards like the general awards are grants .
these awards will vary from 3 thousand to 9 thousand dollars and will be available to nunavut students entering post-secondary education for the first time .
if you have any questions i would invite you to contact the executive director of our scholarship committee , luke issaluk at 867-857-3050 or the chairperson jean cooper , 867-975-5600 .

nunavut sealing strategy
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
early in the life of this government and in the early days of my position as minister of sustainable development , i accepted an invitation to the montreal fur and fashion show .
this show was a great education for me on the vast market there is for fur fashion in this world .
it was also an opportunity for me to examine the issues that we face in nunavut , in rebuilding a market for our seal products especially .
from that day forward , mr. speaker i resolved to dedicate my energy on this issue to implementing a nunavut sealing strategy .
mr. speaker , i want to advise the members today that the first phase of the nunavut sealing strategy is nearing completion and has involved three key elements .
mr. speaker this video will speak to one of this governments core bathurst principles , our self-reliance .
mr. speaker , i believe nunavummiut expect this government to focus on all aspects of our economy including the longest surviving , and the most sustainable economy , our seal hunt .
it is my commitment today that in the coming days i will do my very best to honour this expectation .
thank you .

minister &apos;s statement 33 - 1 ( 3 ) :
corrections planning committee report
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
i did this for a number of reasons .
first we know that we have serious deficiencies in terms of our institutional facilities and our ability to provide adequate programming for our offenders .
second , we recognize the serious need to have many offenders treated and healed in their communities rather than in jail in iqaluit .
we needed a realistic assessment of the situation and recommendations that would work , therefore i appointed a number of individuals from the communities to the committee :
the committee is chaired by rebecca williams , assistant deputy minister of justice .
i am pleased to report that the corrections planning committee has submitted it &apos;s final report to me .
i believe that the committee has done an excellent job of reviewing the state of corrections in nunavut .
they have clearly assessed the problems and have provided a set of recommendations that should have significant impacts on improving our justice system .
also , their recommendations are aimed at ensuring adequate correctional facilities with effective programming , as well as involving the communities in helping offenders to heal and re-integrate to the communities .
i would like to point out that the corrections planning committee has been consistent with the principles of inuit qaujimajatuqangit .
the committee members were selected from the communities and so reflect the interests of those communities .
the recommendations reflect the need to handle these issues in a way that is relevant to the needs and aspirations of our residents .
i am providing members with copies of the report , and i intend to review it more thoroughly in the coming weeks .
i plan to have further statements for the next sitting of the legislature .
in the meantime i would be grateful for any comments or suggestions that members might have to give me .
thank you mr. speaker .
&gt; &gt; applause
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .

sanikiluaq elder &apos;s advice to mlas
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
when we invited our elders for the official opening of this house , the elder that i invited from my community wanted to give some advice to the members of the legislative assembly .
he gave me a message he wanted to relay to the members and he talked about the traditional ways he had learned .
that elder stated , and in no way am i pointing to anybody , that he did not really like to hear about our leaders having problems with alcohol or for criminal actions .
he has heard about members of the previous legislative assemblies having problems and he does not want to see this present legislature have any problems like that .

in regards to the single time zone that is being proposed .
i am going to do the best i can to let you know of the strong opposition from my community and the other baffin communities that are opposed to this proposal .
it is going to take a while for us to get used to the new time zone and at 2 o &apos;clock we will be going back two hours .
i don &apos;t know whether we are going to have to stay up for an extra two hours or i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen .
&gt; &gt; laughter
sure it may be very funny , it might be amusing .
i am concerned about the people of the baffin region .
believe me this is very important to me , i feel very strongly about this .
i want you to know that i am going to work very hard on it , my problem is that the baffin region will have to go two hours and the other regions one .
i know that it is going to be good for the people of the keewatin region , it is not going to effect them and the kitikmeot region will not be effected as much .
it is going to be the people of the baffin region most effected .
i would like you to consider compromising and think about the population of the baffin region .
even if you combine both the kitikmeot and the keewatin populations , the baffin region total population will always be more .
those ministers laughing across me right now will stop laughing , i assure you ..

item 6 :
oral questions
question 74 - 1 ( 3 ) :
cigarette smoking
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na uqaqti . mr. speaker .
it is with great delight today that i stand up and ask a question to the member responsible for smoking .
he gave us an interesting statistic last week in our committee meetings that said 93 % of teenage girls in nunavut smoke .
when i heard that statistic i was appalled , totally appalled that the statistics up here seem to be more than the national average .
but in that statistic i was just reflecting back , i have not seen one poster in my community on anti-smoking .
i wonder if the minister responsible has got any kind of plan to implement an anti-smoking plan in nunavut and more so , combine it where it is in the schools also .
ma &apos;na .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
ma &apos;na mr. mclean .
minister of health , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker the member brings up a very serious and very important topic .
here in nunavut we have the highest average per capita of smokers in the country .
smoking related diseases , respiratory diseases , are highly preventable , if we could stem the tide of smoking .
in general mr. speaker , to answer the member &apos;s question , smoking and anti-smoking campaigns are normally run through our regional health boards .
they target the priorities for public information and then they deliver the messages out to the public .
i have had a chance to review that and our deputy minister and our health people are looking at it and hopefully we will be able to bring something like that forward in nunavut .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
oral questions . mr. iqaqrialu .
question 75 - 1 ( 3 ) :
health boarding homes
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i have a question for the minister of health and social services in regards to the patients who go down to ottawa for medical services .
the other day we heard on the radio some of the patients went down there and they were having problems with patients and escorts who went down .
they are not welcomed in that facility , rotel , and especially the rotel is being heavily used by the people of the baffin region .
the patients who go down there and the escorts , are they going to be put down by this rotel that we use .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
because it isn &apos;t acceptable .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. picco .
supplementary mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
because when we pay for services we expect them to be treated properly .
are these monies being used properly for what they were intended .
if they are not then we will have to find some other facility for our patients and our escorts because of that money .
can you do that as the minister of health and social services .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
so under ottawa we have a group called the ohsni which is the ottawa health services incorporated network .
they facilitate our patients coming from the baffin region of nunavut to ottawa .
in ottawa , mr. speaker , we did not have a baffin house of course because we just transferred the services .
in ottawa there is a facility called the rotel .
the rotel is run by the ohsni group .
the rotel is on the ground in ottawa and services patients who had to leave from different parts of ontario , not just from nunavut .
if you are living in smiths falls , ontario , you have to go to ottawa for the hospital and you have an opportunity to stay at the rotel .
over the past two years we have had some concerns with the rotel , indeed in my own family we have some serious situations with patients staying there .
so we are acutely aware of those problems , mr. speaker .
but there is a contract in place for the next year and a half between the rotel and the baffin regional health &amp; social services board .
that contract mr. speaker , on march 31st , 2000 will be assumed by us , the government of nunavut .
indeed , we have had letters on them and we are looking into that contract right now .
i reiterate that this government will not sit idly by if people , our patients , our constituents , the residents of nunavut are being ill treated at one of the boarding homes .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. picco .
third supplementary mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
how are we going to rectify this situation .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
in that context mr. speaker , about two weeks ago i was in winnipeg for the re-opening of the new boarding home there .
that boarding home , mr. speaker , has put in a sobriety clause , that anyone who has liquor on their breath , even on their breath , will not go through the door .
mr. speaker that is not acceptable .
the model that is being used in winnipeg is a good model and i endorse it .
i say to you mr. speaker , that in some cases some people don &apos;t want to talk about these types of situations , but i say we deal with them .
if you are going down for chemotherapy or radiation therapy to ottawa , you deserve to feel safe and be escorted by someone who is sober .
we are not going to sit around as a government , mr. speaker , and have our patients put in jeopardy by drunken escorts , i can guarantee you that right now sir .
thank you .
&gt; &gt; applause
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. picco .
your final supplementary , mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
we value life and when the escorts go down there , they are still human beings and they are still alive , but they cannot even get into the boarding home .
if somebody committed suicide we can no longer do anything about it .
but a person who has abused alcohol , who is drunk , they are human beings , they are still human beings .
rather than making that person look bad , is that going to be your normal practice now , because this has an impact on our lives .
as the minister are you saying that you don &apos;t like the people who drink ?
they are still at the level of human beings , there is opportunity for them to get healed .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
your question is out of order .
he is the minister for health .
you cannot ask the minister an individual question like that .
mr. picco .
oral questions .
mr. o &apos;brien .
question 76 - 1 ( 3 ) :
budget
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question is directed to the minister of finance in regards to the budget update that he gave earlier this afternoon .
mr. speaker in his statement he indicated that we were experiencing a decrease in revenue , about 5.7 million dollars .
could the minister give some detail as to what areas this revenue is being lost .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minster of finance .
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker there have been some decreases in personal income tax .
taxes , the collection rates were lower than expected , also there has been some reduction in the revenue projections for corporate income taxes , as well as the personal income taxes .
there is also other areas of taxation , fuel taxes as well that are coming in lower than expected and those are some of the main areas for the causes of reductions in revenues .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
oral questions , mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker also in the minister &apos;s update he indicated that we expected not to spend around 10.3 million dollars less than was originally projected .
i believe he indicated that this was partly due to the hirings that have not taken place to this point .
can the minister say whether the amount of 10 million dollars , whether that represents 60 , 70 , or 80 % of the budget for hiring and associated costs .
in other words how much of this 10 million dollars is associated with the decrease in hiring .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker the 10.3 million dollars anticipated as amounts not being spent by all the departments , is inclusive of all their expenditures including the wages and salaries the honourable member is referring to .
if you want to put it in perspective though the government of nunavut salaries and benefits totals approximately 90 million dollars budgetary wise out of our 600 million dollars .
so if you put it in that perspective we are talking about 15 % of the government &apos;s budget in wages and salaries .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
well , mr. speaker it is hard for me to answer that question .
i wasn &apos;t involved directly in the negotiations for the formula financing .
as you know the office of the interim commissioner , government of the nwt , nti were at the table in that respect .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
supplementary mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker it is my understanding that the minister and his staff indicated that we were at approximately 58 to 60 % capacity in our hiring .
i just find it difficult to understand that with 40 % not being hired , how that could only equate to a 10 million dollar saving .
actually it is less than 10 million dollars because you indicated there were other areas that there were savings in .
i am wondering if the minister could explain in more detail as to what that actually represents .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister of finance , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i actually think it is quite simple to explain .
of course , when i had these numbers i asked the same questions of my officials and what the rationale would be .
if you used the government of nunavut 53 % one has to realize that is 53 % staffing of the permanent positions that were budgeted , that we approved in this house .
but that does not take into consideration , mr. speaker , the casual staffing , the contracting back , the consultants that are hired in the interim to address shortfalls in the staffing levels .
in order to continue to provide services when we don &apos;t have all the permanent staffing on hand , that &apos;s how the departments are dealing with the provision of services .
that &apos;s primarily the main reason .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
before i recognize another member , i would like to recognize the world renowned susan aglukkaaq and her sister vivian aglukkaaq .

oral questions .
mr. kattuk .
question 77 - 1 ( 3 ) :
public consultations
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question is directed to the premier , the government leader .
when we first got elected we stated to the people of nunavut that we would be closer to them and that we would be open and transparent .
is this government going to be making decisions and making regulations prior to consulting with the people of nunavut .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kattuk .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) : thank you mr. speaker .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
oral questions .
mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
i don &apos;t think you understand me .
i &apos;ll use an example because one single time zone is very important to us .
prior to this decision being given to the people of nunavut you did not consult with the communities as to how the single time zone would be dealt with .
you did not get input or consult with the people of nunavut so that &apos;s why i had asked you if you &apos;re going to be doing this .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kattuk .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker , we had consensus on april 1st and there was agreement in the association of municipalities agm to set up one time zone for nunavut .
we are implementing that today .
it &apos;s just going to be one hour here for the baffin region .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
before i recognize anyone i would like to let you know that this should be dealt with at the committee of the whole .
i don &apos;t believe that we should deal with it during oral questions .
( interpretation ends ) you are out of order .
oral question .
mr. irqittuq .
question 78 - 1 ( 3 ) :
outpost camps for offenders
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you . mr. speaker .
i have a question for the minister of justice .
how do you go about making a proposal to set up a camp that would be used for youth who have committed crimes .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
minister responsible for justice , mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
i would like to thank you .
are you talking about getting assistance for building such facilities or what were you asking for specifically .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
if you could make a supplementary comment or rephrase your question mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
thank you .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
i apologize .
some of the communities are starting to establish camps to take in clients from the correctional centres .
any community whether they be small or large could take on these youth and that &apos;s being established in some of the nunavut communities .
if you would like to get further information you could call the department of justice or go through the justice committees that are established in some of the communities .
you could ask for information from these departments .
the department of justice is more than willing to see more camps set up for the youth .
speaker :
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
is there any financial assistance or has there been a decrease in the amount that could have been used for the camps .
speaker :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
anyone who would like to set up a camp to take out young people and who want to have clients in their camps , the criteria is still the same .
we could look into it but what we do is we give them financial assistance to help them with their transportation , food and so on .
speaker :
thank you .
oral questions .
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
so if one of the youth would like to use one of these outpost camp facilities , who would they direct their request to .
either myself or whose department .
speaker :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
you could either get help from the department of justice or if they want to , they could call my office directly .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
mr. nutarak .
question 79 - 1 ( 3 ) :
staff issues with decentralization
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i would like to ask a question to dpw .
i have heard that the department is going to be moving up to pond inlet .
i was talking to one of the employees who lives in iqaluit and doesn &apos;t want to go to pond inlet because the department is moving up there .
what &apos;s going to happen .
there are some people who do not want to move from their place of residence to another community because their department &apos;s moving .
what happens if there are some vacant positions because the employees don &apos;t go up .
would you have training programs available for local people in pond inlet so that these positions could be filled .
thank you mr. speaker .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
the member has been concerned about some of the employees not wanting to move to pond inlet .
these are the plans we have in place .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you ms. thompson .
mr. puqiqnak .
question 80 - 1 ( 3 ) :
project surname
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i have a question directed to the premier .
so i &apos;m encouraging you to make changes .
how much work would it require .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
mr. okalik .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
especially when the elders want to make changes to their names , the way they &apos;re spelled .
perhaps i could get the law reform committee to look into this issue too and i could also include that .
i have urged the members of the legislative assembly asking them what kind of issues they want to be looked at by the law reform committee .
if you want this to be a priority i could do this .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you for your response .
prior to our government being established , our previous government of the nwt had initiated this .
it was territory wide including the nunavut area .
the gnwt had initiated a project called operation surname and i know that it costs money to do it .
since it was gnwt who made all those mistakes , why should the nunavut government have to pay for all those mistakes .
so i would like you to consider this carefully .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. okalik .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
first of all it was not by the gnwt , it was initiated by the federal government .
the project surname was initiated for anybody who would like to change their names or change the spelling .
it has to go through the court system and we had inherited this act .
therefore , i could ask the law reform committee to review this so that it will make it easier for nunavut residents to make changes .
thank you .
speaker :
oral questions .
mr. akesuk .
question 81 - 1 ( 3 ) :
kimmirut &apos;s water reservoir
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i would like to direct my question to the minister of public works .
i received an urgent letter from kimmirut because their reservoir is quite far and they have a pipeline going into the community .
i would like to know since there was a study done , what has been done to date .
we haven &apos;t received the results to date .
could you let me know what the status is now on this issue .
thank you .
speaker :
minister responsible for public works , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
we can only start working on it if we get direction from the department of cg &amp; t.
i can talk about the budget portion of it but it was in the b list .
as you know we deal with urgent situations where there &apos;s safety , health and so on .
we first have to get money from mr. anawak &apos;s department before we can do anything about it because my department is just to do public work .
mr. anawak probably knows how to respond to your question better because he &apos;s the one with the money .
thank you .
speaker :
oral question .
mr. iqaqrialu .
question 82 - 1 ( 3 ) :
assistance to clyde river for power costs
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i have a question for the ntpc .
the equipment has arrived in our community and we know that the community of clyde river is in a deficit situation .
we &apos;re going to be paying 40 % of that .
what kind of assistance can we get from the nunavut government in regards to paying for that equipment .
speaker :
thank you .
mr. picco , minister responsible for ntpc .
mr. picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
i guess i should start with thanking the member for his question .
as you know mr. speaker , earlier this summer i had the opportunity to visit clyde river with the member .
i met with the hamlet and the mayor to discuss the construction of the new generating station in the community of clyde river .
now let me back up just a little bit to explain the situation mr. speaker .
we need to be able to provide power , electrical power to clyde .
in partnership with the people of clyde and the hamlet , we &apos;ve been able to facilitate some employment opportunities with infrastructure so there are some good points to this .
their costs will be covered for that .
mr. speaker , the work here is to negate any extraordinary or enormous amount of rate increases for the people of clyde river .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. picco .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i &apos;m sure that there &apos;s going to be annual increases right up to the 40 % mark .
i understand the reasoning behind it .
even if that &apos;s the case , we will get effected one way or another because of course we &apos;re paying out of our pocket for the electrical bill .
the gradual increase over the years will effect us residents .
have you done a review on how this could be implemented ?
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. mr. iqaqrialu .
( interpretation ends ) minister responsible for ntpc , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
i think that &apos;s important to note .
thank you mr. o &apos;brien for your support over there .
you look like a thespian .
thank you mr. speaker .
so the community of clyde river , no increase will occur before a public utilities board application happens .
then we would have an opportunity to have intervenor status on that application and as a government we realize that a 33 - 40 % increase is not acceptable .
what we &apos;re trying to do right now mr. speaker , as a government is look at the whole operation of the nunavut power corporation .
we &apos;re trying to find out exactly , should we maintain the same relationship right now with the ntpc .
should we look at outsourcing somewhere supply or indeed , should we set up a nunavut power corporation .
as you know mr. speaker , the biggest users of power in the communities is the government .
thank you mr. speaker .

the department &apos;s name is so long i was wondering if you can make a name like ilirqusiliriniq arnalirnirmut , minister meaning culture and women secretariat or women , youth and language minister .
just making more of a comment than a question mr. speaker .

question 88 - 1 ( 3 ) :
community freezer repairs mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na uqaqti .
back in 1982 the gnwt built a community freezer in the community of baker lake to the great delight of the residents of baker lake .
in a community like baker lake there are herds of caribou that go by and people take the opportunity to stockpile fresh meat .
the community freezer was a big boon to the community for the last fifteen or sixteen years .
this spring the four compressors , due to no lack of maintenance or anything , finally wore out in the middle of june and broke down .
unfortunately there was close to 40 or 50 thousand pounds of country food in there that the people in my community depended on .
the hamlet wrote to the superintendent , and i assumed that he passed it on to the minister , about us having to throw away 40 thousands pounds of country food .
that really hurt the community .
to date i haven &apos;t heard an answer back or the community hasn &apos;t heard back if they are going to replace the compressors on that freezer .
so my question is to the minister of community government , does he have plans for next year to replace the compressors on that community freezer .
ma &apos;na uqaqti .

hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker i have a response to a petition tabled by the honourable donald havioyak on october 25th , on nunavut liquor permits .
i am pleased to acknowledge the petition tabled in the assembly by the mla for kugluktuk on behalf of his constituents concerning the use of nunavut liquor import permits .
the petition is requesting that the use of nunavut liquor import permits be suspended for the importing of liquor products from the nwt through the yellowknife liquor store .
mr. speaker on april 1st , 1999 , a nunavut liquor permit became necessary to obtain liquor from the yellowknife store because the yellowknife store is now outside the government of nunavut &apos;s jurisdiction .
i agree that this situation has disrupted the usual method that eligible citizens have used to acquire liquor products .
i have asked the recently appointed nunavut liquor licensing board to provide me with advice as to how best to deal with this matter and other issues regarding the liquor act .
thank you .

ajauqtiit standing committee on the appointment of languages commissioner
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i have the honour of presenting the report on the appointment of the languages commissioner of nunavut .
this report was prepared by the standing committee of ajauqtiit after we conducted a thorough selection process to identify the most appropriate candidate for this important public office .
as the report states , our standing committee worked very hard to make sure that our selection process was thorough and unbiased .
a subcommittee of three of our members conducted the interviews and selection process for the languages commissioner which included hunter tootoo , the chair , myself co-chairperson and david iqaqrialu .
members of our committee and subcommittee met thirteen times on the matter of the languages commissioner over the last two months . we received twelve applications from people across nunavut for this position .
we conducted in person interviews with five candidates , reviewed their written answers to questions and evaluated their experience and education as outlined on their resumes .
we also reviewed information from three references for the final candidate .
we thank them all for applying .
nevertheless we had to choose one name to recommend to the members of the legislative assembly .
the languages commissioner of nunavut must have many qualities .
we believe that eva qamaniq arreak has these qualities .
she will do her job in the inuit way .
she will make us proud as a representative of nunavummiut in meetings with other languages commissioners across canada and elsewhere .
eva understands the challenges facing the government of nunavut and the need for a concerted effort on language issues , if the languages of our fathers are to flourish in the future .
thank you mr. speaker , at the appropriate time i will give notice of motion to appoint the languages commissioner .
thank you mr. speaker .

just to remind you , of my statement .
i have established a working group that will focus its efforts on reviewing this policy .
it is my intention that this working group seek input from and consult with all the members of the legislative assembly .
mr. chairman , our timeline is to review this policy as a final made-in-nunavut business incentive policy which needs to be in place for the next contracting season .

chairperson ( interpretation ) :
go ahead , manitok .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :

general comments .
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. chairman .
first of all , i would like to ask the minister about the business incentive policy .
i know that you are going to make amendments and some businesses in nunavut are huge and some are small businesses .
what kind of businesses are you talking about .
are you talking about small businesses that are existing .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. puqiqnak .
madame minister .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. chairman .
we are talking about large businesses and small businesses ... any kind of business , as long as they are a private business in nunavut .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you very much for your response , because for the small businesses that are just starting off , the department of sustainable development is responsible for that .
i was getting confused when you started talking about larger businesses and smaller businesses .
will you be giving support to smaller businesses that want to be initiated ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , uriash .
madame minister .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. chairman .
the department of sustainable development has a program for small businesses that want to be initiated , but we are public works .
thank you .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
i have another question .
you mentioned that this new policy could be introduced by march , 2000 .
in my community there are small businesses that require a lot of assistance .
do you have any plans to get these small businesses up to par with the rest of the businesses .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , uriash .
madame minister , either one of you can respond to his question .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
at this point in time , the policy was inherited from the gnwt .
we cannot operate without any policies , so that &apos;s why we are using the old policy .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
uriash .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
short comment .
thank you , madame minister .
i would like a response about whether this can be implemented before march , 2000 .
is it possible .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i believe that we have to stick to the subject here .
we &apos;re getting out of line .
what we understood was that we would stay on the subject here .
if you could direct your question to the minister &apos;s statement .
i &apos;d like to keep it in line .
you could rephrase your question .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
i think i &apos;ll make another comment , later .

with all due respect to nti , why would it be necessary to have four representatives from nti .
can i have some rationale for that proposal .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
madame minister , if you would like to respond please .
hon. manitok thompson :
mr. chair , that &apos;s our proposal to cabinet and article 24 is from nti .
we have to work together .
that &apos;s the reason why we have equal numbers from each group .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. chairman .
just a comment .
i will be making a motion for the minister to consider putting a name forward from the keewatin chamber of commerce for consideration on this review committee .
i think that &apos;s only reasonable and fair .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. o &apos;brien .
did you want to make a response , madame minister .
hon. manitok thompson :
the group will be also consulting with the keewatin chamber of commerce .
thank you , mr. chair .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , madame minister .
would you like to make further comments .
mr. o &apos;brien :
just for clarification purposes , the minister said that she cannot let us know right now who the individuals are that are going to be on this committee .
is that because it has not been approved by your caucus , by cabinet .
is that my understanding .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. o &apos;brien .
madame minister , or any one of the staff members .
hon. manitok thompson :
thank you , mr. chair .
as i said , i have a proposal to bring forward to cabinet and because we have been so busy we have not gotten to that yet .
that is my proposal at this time .
thank you , mr. chair .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. chair .
minister , i &apos;m just trying to get it clear in my mind .
are you saying that cabinet will make the decision on who is approved for this review committee , or are you making this decision as the minister for your department .
who is making the decision as to who will serve on this committee ?
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. o &apos;brien .
madame minister .
hon. manitok thompson :
thank you , mr. chair .
at this time , i just know the numbers .
i don &apos;t have specific names .
for my department , we have john purdy who is here right now , theresa chandler , terry audla , and barry cornthwaite .
that &apos;s from my department , and the proposal is for four other people from nti .
that &apos;s our proposal , thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. o &apos;brien .
there &apos;s other people who might want to ask questions .
go ahead , please .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. chairman .
my last question , again to the minister .
so i would ask the minister if she would reconsider her proposal and include one of these names or companies .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. o &apos;brien .
i believe that there has to be equal representation from all of nunavut , and there has to be equal representation .
please keep in mind that when you are going to be asking questions .
madame minister .
hon. manitok thompson :
thank you , mr. chair .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , madame minister .
mr. mclean , i believe you have a question . go ahead .
mr. mclean : thank you , david .
if i stray off the minister &apos;s statement , somebody will bring me back to it . before i start , i want to give you a little history lesson .
the business incentive policy that the government of the northwest territories enacted was developed by the keewatin chamber of commerce for the northwest territories .
i have a problem , no offence to bureaucrats , they &apos;re all hardworking and we need them , i see that .
what worries me is that the business incentive policy was a good document , but it was written in 1983 and 1984 and times have changed , where article 24 has come along .
the business incentive policy of today does not reflect article 24 of the land claims agreement .
it should and i agree with it , because there is a large misunderstanding amongst the populace that article 24 and the business incentive policy are separate .
but how do you enact them in government contracts .
that is a tough question to ask , and it &apos;s also going to be harder to answer .
i like the idea of community consultations .
so if you take a tour of communities discussing the business incentive policy you &apos;re going to hear all kinds of different ideas on what article 24 and the business incentive policy are .
just a short question , and mr. chairman , i want to ask some more questions .
is the government going to integrate the business incentive policy and article 24 together in all contracting procedures , is that what the quest of this rewriting is .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. mclean .
madame minister if you would like to respond .
hon. manitok thompson :
everybody is nodding on this side , so i &apos;m nodding too .
yes .
thanks .
mr. mclean :
good .
that &apos;s one of the questions that i &apos;ve been wanting to ask for a long time .
that &apos;s why the business incentive policy was enacted , to protect northern businesses and encourage them to grow .
is that the goal of the business incentive policy that &apos;s going to be rewritten .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. mclean .
madame minister .
hon. manitok thompson :
thank you , mr. chair .
that side is also nodding , so , yes .
we &apos;re saying yes too many times , glen , i mean mr. mclean , but yes .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
ms. thompson is at the witness table and questions could be asked from any one of the members here .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na .
we will have a chance to bring this document forward in our standing committee .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
madam minister if you would like to respond please .
hon. manitok thompson :

chairperson ( interpretation ) :

mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na mr. chairman .
the minister has answered all my questions and i &apos;m happy with the responses i got from her and i &apos;m sure this business incentive policy is going to be one that reflects nunavut .
i &apos;ll sleep a lot better tonight knowing that .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. mclean .
it &apos;s ok if the minister &apos;s doesn &apos;t make any comments .
if you don &apos;t have any comments to make or if you don &apos;t have any questions .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
on article 24 , i had no kind of direction and we do have many questions to ask i just want to , i know that it states april 1 , 2000 .
i know that this policy will be implemented on that date , i was wondering if that will be announced at that time .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
madame minister if you would like to respond .
hon. manitok thompson :
thank you mr. chairman .
i &apos;ll let him answer this .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
the floor &apos;s open .
mr. bain :
when the business incentive policy was brought into force within the nunavut government it was only approved for 12 months and was set to expire april 1 , 2000 .
we &apos;re hoping to get a new policy in place so there &apos;s no confusion with contractors for the next contracting season .
nukarmiik .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. bain .
mr. nutarak do you have any other questions .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :

thank you .

thank you mr. nutarak .
madam minister do you want to make a response .
ok . any other comments .

so start now please .
thank you .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
can i invite my official kimberly baine ?
i will speak in english .
i &apos;ll first provide members with an overview of the effected legislation and then the rationale for the proposed amendment .
members can then ask detailed questions of myself and my staff .
the gnwt passed the access to information and protection of privacy act in 1994 .
the act came into force on december 31 , 1996 .
this allowed the nwt government two years to prepare for the requirements for compliance under the new legislation .
the act was then inherited by the nunavut government on april 1 of this year .
the act balances the peoples &apos; rights to privacy with the publics &apos; right to access information held by government .
the act restricts what types of personal information the government can collect about nunavummiut , and once collected what the government can do with that information .
the act also provides mechanisms for nunavummiut to request information held by government and clearly determines what information government must release and what information must be kept confidential .
similar access and privacy regimes are legislated in every other jurisdiction in canada .
under the act nunavummiut can be assured that their privacy will be upheld by the nunavut government and that they can access information held by government as provided for in the legislation .
on december 31 of this year , section 4 , clause 1 ends and section 4 clause 2 comes into effect .
clause 2 states that the access to information and protection of privacy act will prevail over all other acts unless specific amendments are made to state otherwise .
this allowed the gnwt legislature to consider all other privacy clauses in other legislation and determine if they are inconsistent with the access to information and protection of privacy act .
and if they were inconsistent to decide which one should prevail .
the gnwt passed an act to amend the access to information and the protection of privacy act this fall .
the act amended ten acts to reconcile the differences in the privacy and access rules between those acts and the access to information and protection of privacy act .
the gnwt took three years to determine which acts required changes to the access to information and protection of privacy act .
we believe that the assembly and the nunavut access and privacy commissioner who will be appointed by the assembly should be involved in these decisions .
unfortunately as the act is now written these decisions must be made and the amendment enacted before december 31 , 1999 .
this does not give the public the right of access and the privacy commissioner or members of this assembly time to consider the matter .
bill 6 extends the december 31 deadline by one year .
mr. chairman , one year is not a long time to undertake the legal and policy work needed to make the necessary amendments .
what we are proposing is to leave all legislation as it is today for a maximum of one year .
with that i wish to thank the members for allowing me to say a few words on the act .
qujannamiik .

ministers &apos; statements
minister &apos;s statement 34 - 1 ( 3 ) :
recruitment &amp; retention of health care providers
hon. ed picco :
qujannamiik uqaqti .
we are all aware of the daily challenges that face the health and social service providers striving to meet the needs of nunavummiut .
in recognition of their valued work our department has earmarked 1.26 million dollars in pay adjustments for nunavut nurses and social workers , retroactive , mr. speaker , to april 1st , 1998 .
these adjustments will place our nurses and social workers amongst the highest paid in canada .
this , mr. speaker , is only one step towards creating a stable work force and i believe a demonstration of the high regard in which we hold our nurses and social workers .
mr. speaker , the department of health &amp; social services is committed to being part of a government that seeks direction from the people .
we have set up a team of representatives from across nunavut to recommend solutions to the challenge of recruiting and retaining nurses in our communities .
this group , the nunavut illusarijiit action team will work with nunavut health care providers and each member has direct experience about what it takes to attract and retain nurses within nunavut .
their reports to the department will be treated with priority and contribute to the strategies being developed within the department .
mr. speaker , the department is also in the process of hiring a nunavut work force development officer .
this person will be primarily responsible for recruitment and retention activities within the department and will work closely with the nunavut illusarijiit action team .
finally , i am pleased to tell you that over the next several months i am planning to hold a series of ministerial focus groups in several nunavut communities .
mr. speaker we have taken the first steps towards developing an effective recruitment and retention strategy for nunavut , and i look forward to updating this house as these initiatives develop .
i should also add , mr. speaker , that the mental health worker that was requested last week for arviat is now going to be in place in the coming weeks .
thank you mr. speaker .

minister &apos;s statement 35 - 1 ( 3 ) :
french language school in iqaluit
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
yesterday i said i was going to be speaking in english and today i am going to be speaking in french .
the new french school will give us an opportunity to demonstrate our belief in cultural diversity within nunavut .
the building of this facility has long been a goal of the local francophone society .
mr. speaker , the site for the new school will be adjacent to the middle school in the new subdivision and will share the yet to be constructed playground that will serve both schools .
mr. speaker , operational costs will come from the existing funding formula and supplemented through heritage canada funding for programs in support of french language instruction .
the new french school will directly cost the government of nunavut approximately 500 thousand dollars over two years .
in addition the government of nunavut and the town of iqaluit will provide 600 thousand dollars of in kind contributions .
the federal government will spend an estimated 4.5 million dollars to build the school .
nunavut will also receive approximately 539 thousand dollars in federal funds for program support and development to cover the costs of a french school program co-ordinator , support staff and associated administrative costs .
thank you mr. speaker .

appointments to ndc and nbcc boards
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i am pleased to be able to provide this house with the names of individuals appointed to the board of the nunavut development corporation and the nunavut business credit corporation .
on april 1 , 1999 , this government took over responsibility for the nunavut development corporation act which as members know , is responsible for making investments in community based businesses .
in my home community of pangnirtung there are two of these investments ;
pangnirtung fisheries ltd , and uqqummiut arts and crafts ltd .
there are seven other operating businesses in nunavut .
i am pleased to announce that the following people will make up the nunavut development corporation &apos;s board :
on april 1 , 1999 this government also took responsibility for the nunavut business credit corporation act which provides loans , loan guarantees and bonds to nunavut businesses .
the seventh and final member is expected to be appointed later this month , so i look forward to the board assuming their responsibilities .

nti bruisers vs mla sharks
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker i rise today with some urgency on a matter that occurred yesterday .
nti was ably coached by jose &quot; the killer &quot; kusugak and pat &quot; burns &quot; lyall .
they came with an awesome team , mr. speaker , centred and supported by the likes of james &quot; tank &quot; etuluk , and paul &quot; the king &quot; kaludjuak .
now mr. speaker , members and staff of this house were second to none .
led by paul &quot; the gump worsely &quot; okalik in goals and james &quot; 68 year old ace &quot; arvaluk .
the ledge team were exciting and dominant .
uqaqti , donald &quot; the hit man &quot; havioyak and peter &quot; king &quot; kattuk , did a superb job in coaching our team .
&gt; &gt; laughter
... or most valuable picco .
not bad for a player who broke his two feet and still can skate and score like an older pavel bure .
i would like to thank nti , the staff and members of this house for participating .
all proceeds were donated to the homeless shelter here in iqaluit .
a special thanks to jerry &quot; the excel &quot; ell , for an excellent job refereeing the game .

member &apos;s statement 54 - 1 ( 3 ) :
relaxation tapes and inuit
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
usually we don &apos;t comment about retail products here but i would like to make an exception .
as employees or public servants or members of the legislative assembly , we have a hard time sleeping sometimes because of all the jobs that we have to do .
when i put it on the sound of animals and the outdoors came on i became more awake and very , very alert .
my instinct was to get ready and go hunting .
so i don &apos;t suggest those tapes be bought by inuit .

mla sharks goalie
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
since today is friday i am very pleased that we did quite a bit of work this week and now i hope we will be able to relax soon .
last night at the hockey game i was one of the observers and i was told to be the cheerleader to help cheer for the members of the legislative assembly .
i did my best but i guess it didn &apos;t help very much , as the mla team lost .
i couldn &apos;t quite figure out the time because the clock seemed to be at a standstill , i don &apos;t know whose time zone it was on .
i also couldn &apos;t recognize the goalie for our team .
i didn &apos;t like his performance and i was yelling &quot; remove the goalie &quot; , &quot; get rid of him &quot; .
i kept saying that and then my son came over and gave me his hockey stick .
i used it to bang on the wall while chanting &quot; get rid of him &quot; , &quot; remove the goalie &quot; .
it was then that i found out it was paul okalik , our premier .
so i apologize today to paul okalik , because everyone else at the arena heard me and knew who it was , and i didn &apos;t .
unknowingly , i kept telling the people there to remove him .
thank you .

mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i saw something that i didn &apos;t think that i was going to see .
jobie nutarak who is sitting next to me is a lot better hockey player than i am .
so for your information he is my mvp .
i also saw james arvaluk zooming around on the ice .
as for the other players , i thought there were a bunch of penalties that were uncalled for to my team .

thank you mr. speaker .
last night we had a celebration up at joamie school .
there were games for both the students and the parents .
when i was up there and walking around i was checking out what kinds of games were being played and where i could participate .
somebody touched me on the shoulder and asked me if i was peter kilabuk .
when i said yes he gave me a paper and it said , i am sorry but you have to go to jail .
but i believe it was one of my employees .

sanikiluaq &apos;s position on time zone change
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
although you may be relaxed today , myself i am not .
in regards to the time zone , yesterday the hamlet council of sanikiluaq had an urgent meeting with the residents of sanikiluaq in regards to the single time zone .
they are still very opposed to the change .
usually on october 31st , they just want to turn back with daylight savings time , by one hour .
so they passed a motion to turn back one hour only , mr. speaker .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kattuk .

arvaluk and hall beach
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
it is my pleasure that this morning you could loosen up and i am going to be speaking on a contentious issue .
we of course have many friends and james arvaluk and i have known each other for a long time , for as long as i can remember .
i had never gone hunting with him during our years growing up together .
i think it was in the 1980 &apos;s that he came to my community of hall beach .
so james said in response , people tell us not to leave meat behind , so i want to load it up in the canoe .

mr. o &apos;brien .
member &apos;s statement 61 - 1 ( 3 ) :
compromise for time zone issue
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. speaker . mr. speaker , today i rise to speak about the issue of the single time zone for nunavut .
mr. speaker i commend the government for moving on this issue which is designed to unify nunavut .
having one time zone for nunavut is something that i personally support and also my constituents .
mr. speaker , i am fortunate to live in a community that is in the geographic centre of nunavut .
this means for the people of my region and my community that they will not have to make a major change on october 31st .
but mr. speaker it distresses me that many of the communities in the baffin are expressing much discontent about this as it effects them more deeply .
mr. speaker , if we are to have this change done in the spirit of unifying nunavut , then we must do it in a manner which unifies and doesn &apos;t divide the people .
surely there must be some compromise which will allow the people of the baffin communities to understand that the government is listening to their concerns .
we have heard some suggestions from people to move the date of implementation of this initiative forward to the spring or summer when it would have less effect on the people &apos;s immediate routines .
could we phase in so that the kitikmeot and kivalliq region begin on october 31st and the east begins on april 1st or july 1st .

mr. speaker my question is to the minister responsible for health and social services .
mr. speaker it relates to the delay in the construction of the health centre in my home community of arviat .
i wonder if the minister could update me as to the status of this project .
it was delayed but there has been some success , i guess , to get it kick started .

it is still going to move forward , there have been discussions with the development corporation and indeed , with the council and the mayor of arviat .

mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker it is my understanding that part of the problem has been rectified and there had to be a clean up and so on and it is just a question of costs .
my question would be who pays for this additional cost to clean up this site to make it ready for construction .

purchase of country food from kivalliq communities
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na uqaqti .
presently there is a federally inspected meat and fish plant located in rankin inlet .
at this point , we all know there is a job shortage in the kivalliq region and there is an abundance of fish and caribou in the region .
would the minister investigate the possibility of purchasing fish and caribou from all the kivalliq communities so it can stimulate the traditional economy .
thank you .
speaker :

question 96 - 1 ( 3 ) :
housing for social worker
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i have a question to the minister of health and social services .
i have made repeated requests to find out if there is housing available now in kimmirut for the social service workers .
we have just heard in mr. o &apos;brien &apos;s riding that they have housing provided , so i am asking this question .
speaker :
thank you mr. akesuk .
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , mr. akesuk has been a very persistent and strong advocate for the social worker position in kimmirut .
although the community of kimmirut had identified two private homes that may be available , mr. speaker , for the accommodations for the staffing of the social worker position .

mr. kattuk .
question 97 - 1 ( 3 ) :
funding for access road
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i have a question to the minister of community government .
i have a question in regards to inadequate funding for an access road that was built .
the minister had made a statement that the hamlets have to request funding on an annual basis .
my question is do we have to do that .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kattuk .
minister of community government , mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
in regards to the building of roads outside of the hamlet boundaries i believe with the past government they got funding to build additional roads that are outside of the hamlet boundaries .
this didn &apos;t get passed on to the nunavut government but we are presently having discussions with the federal government department of transportation .
we hope soon to get funds for those types of projects but i can &apos;t tell you exactly how much money we will be receiving .
i can only say that we will review those types of programs , programs that are set up for access roads .
i do know that there was such a program set up by the gnwt but i don &apos;t know , we &apos;ll look into it and have discussions with the federal government .
thank you .

question 98 - 1 ( 3 ) :
wheelchair for clyde river resident
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :

i would like to direct my question to the minister of health and social services .
speaker :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister responsible for health , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco : thank you mr. speaker .
it was a sad situation mr. speaker , the person that the member was talking about from his community was in an ill fitted wheelchair .
i think that was a very good thing to see .
i believe the chairman is mr. davidee arnaquq who i have had an opportunity to meet at that meeting and have been in communication with him in the past .
the worker here in iqaluit is meeka kilabuk , who needs no introduction .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
oral questions .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i know that we expect that wheelchair to come in .
when do we expect that wheelchair to come into my community .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister of health , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker we should point out i guess at this time and explain something about wheelchairs .
a lot of people believe that you just sit in a wheelchair .
indeed , mr. speaker the wheelchair has to be fitted properly .
we have a person right now working for the baffin regional health and social services board who is actually trained in fitting people for a wheelchair .
you just don &apos;t take any wheelchair , mr. speaker .
it wasn &apos;t fitted properly and this was pointed out to me as the minister of health and social services and premier okalik when we attended the meeting here in iqaluit .
we rectified the situation by getting a wheelchair and getting it fitted at that time at the hospital .
the wheelchair in question mr. speaker , is a motorized wheelchair , it has a battery where the person will be able to navigate in their home which is a good thing .
thank you mr. speaker .

mr. irqittuq .
question 99 - 1 ( 3 ) :
doctor for igloolik
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question is to the minister of health and social services .
last spring we were supposed to get a doctor in igloolik which is my constituency and you said this at the time that you and i went to igloolik .
you told the igloolik residents that you would be getting them a resident doctor .
but this was not the case so now my question is mr. speaker , are there any plans to get this doctor for igloolik .
speaker :
thank you , mr. irqittuq .
minister for health and social services .
mr. picco . hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i am so pleased that the member has brought up this question and the reason of course being the misinformation surrounding the doctor and the community of igloolik .
i never said i was putting one there .
i never said that at all .
what happened at the meeting i said i understood that , it was my understanding that there would be doctor coming here .
and the mayor , who worked for dpw , understood that there had been a process at that time trying to get a room ready at the health centre .
so they were aware of it , of the possibility of a doctor going to igloolik , the possibility of putting a doctor in igloolik .
after saying that , mr. speaker , what we have in nunavut , for primary health care , is nurse practitioners .
putting a doctor in a community doesn &apos;t make people more healthy , mr. speaker .
we have good trained professionals in communities .
when i have attended the health ministers meetings , with all the national ministers , they talk about having a model like we have .
we have nurse practitioners , a doctor in a community doesn &apos;t make you more healthy .
and that &apos;s the kind of things that we &apos;re working toward .
i &apos;d like to thank the member for bringing it up and clarifying the issue with the doctor .
speaker :
thank you , mr. picco .
mr. irqittuq
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i don &apos;t know if he understood my question .
are there any plans to get a doctor in igloolik in the future .
that was my question .
i didn &apos;t ask any other question .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister for health , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
that &apos;s at this time .
at this time , that &apos;s not the case .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you , mr. picco .
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i have a different question , so i &apos;ll ask it later on .
speaker :
oral questions .
mr. alakannuark .
question 100 - 1 ( 3 ) :
bowhead whale study
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question is directed to the minister of sustainable development , wildlife division .
in one of my constituencies , there is an abundance of bowhead whales .
in pelly bay , they would like to be able to harvest bowheads , but they were told by the department of fisheries and oceans that this bowhead stock comes from the baffin region .
my question is has there been any study as to where these stocks come from ?
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
minister for sustainable development , mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) yes , thank you mr. speaker .
yes , in regard to the bowhead whales , we keep hearing more about the concerns about bowhead whales , as to where they migrate to .
but at this point , with the nunavut wildlife management board , we &apos;re working very closely together , through research , we study as to how these species are important to inuit people .
dfo in ottawa , had done a study , and research on this .
they are now collecting all the results .
thank you .
speaker :
oral questions , mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
we would like to know if there has been any study done on bowhead whales in the pelly bay area .
so i would like the minister for sustainable development to look into this further .
thank you .
speaker :
i did not hear a question .
mr. puqiqnak .
question 101 - 1 ( 3 ) :
appointment to boards
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question is directed to the minister for sustainable development .
i keep asking the minister for that department .
however , mr. speaker , this morning , under ministers &apos; statements , on the nunavut development corporation and nunavut business credit corporation , these two boards .
did you appoint these members as a minister .
did you appoint these people .
speaker :
thank you , mr. puqiqnak .
minister for sustainable development , mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk :
( interpretation ) thank you mr. speaker .
if i understand your question correctly , you are looking for the names to be appointed to these boards .
we had asked for nominations and then we had publicized this ... and the appointments were made through the nominations of regular members .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you , mr. kilabuk .
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i apologize .
i did not see any documentation .
so my apologies , because the kitikmeot region , for example , we do have a member .
i apologize .
my constituency is not represented in this board that you just appointed .
i suggest that we utilize all the communities .
the other community in my constituency is not represented on this board .
so i don &apos;t think that we should be lopsided .
thank you .
question 102 - 1 ( 3 ) :
internet services in communities
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. speaker .
over the last while , we &apos;ve heard a lot about the information highway and internet service to communities .
speaker :
thank you . , mr. mclean .
minister responsible for pwtts .
hon. manitok thompson :
thank you mr. speaker .
we have been thinking of linking up all the communities , but at this time we &apos;re putting priority on the larger communities but the smaller communities are planned for the future .
we hope to link up all the nunavut communities some time in the future .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you . , ms. thompson .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. speaker .
and that is also good for the business community , for people to sell their traditional things like clothing and carvings and stuff like that .
could the minister be more direct in what kind of a time line we &apos;re looking at with providing internet service to the smaller communities ?
thank you .
speaker :
my staff is aware of this , that it &apos;s something that we have to find a way for those communities to start connecting with internet . thank you .
i don &apos;t have a timeline on when we &apos;re going to do these things . thank you .
thank you mr. speaker . i don &apos;t want to put undue pressure on the minister to give me too much of a timeline .
but as we all know , this government is in sort of a financial surplus .... and it &apos;s my humble opinion that internet access in nunavut should be available to everybody in nunavut .
and i &apos;m wondering if the minister would go forward to her cabinet colleagues and fmbs to give the rest of nunavut what the larger regional centres have .
because i feel that this is important to myself and all the people of nunavut , to have internet access .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you , mr. mclean . minister responsible for telecommunications and technical services , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson : thank you mr. speaker .
i realize that , so yes , i &apos;ll do that . thank you .
speaker : thank you .
oral questions . mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien : it &apos;s ok .
oral questions . mr. iqaqrialu .
question 103 - 1 ( 3 ) :
health statistics
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i have a question for the minister of health and social services .
those of us who live in nunavut , there &apos;s approximately a total population of twenty eight to thirty thousand , i &apos;m not quite sure , i &apos;m just approximating the figure .
yesterday , we said that the people of nunavut are the heaviest smokers in canada , and there &apos;s approximately ninety per cent of us who smoke .
we have the smallest population .
how come we always have the largest population with social problems ?
there &apos;s other canadians in the millions - how come we &apos;re always told that we have the highest population with social problems when we have a very , very small population .
could you explain this , mr. minister .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you . , mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
speaker , the member brings up an interesting area , and that is the area of ratios , stats , numbers , figures .
i &apos;m not a mathematician , speaker , or indeed , as mr. ng said , a statistician .
what i am is a person who understands what the question is the member is trying to bring up , if i &apos;m correct , is why our rate is so high .
and that &apos;s based on a ratio .
and i &apos;ll try to explain it this way .
so what that means , is when you look at canada as a whole , maybe one in one thousand people has a certain kind of cancer .
and then we take that , and in nunavut , it may be , based on our smaller population ratio , it may be five in one thousand people .
it doesn &apos;t mean that because we have a smaller population base , why are we having these numbers .
each population ratio stands alone on its own merits , as it were .
so in this case , the reason why we have so many high numbers is based on the ratio that &apos;s brought forward per capita .
that &apos;s what we always use as the number , mr. speaker , is per capita .
i don &apos;t know if that helps the member , to explain why it seems so high , even though we have a small population we have higher incidences of this .
the reason for that is based on the smaller population based on the smaller ratio .
it comes down to the lowest common denominator .
and i hope that helps clarify the answer .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you . , mr. picco .
oral questions , mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i can never believe those numbers because of our small population .
i just feel that we &apos;re made to look bad in nunavut .
maybe the people out there want us to look bad , through alcohol abuse , heavy smoking , a large population that smokes .
it seems that we &apos;re always the ones having all these things .
we have a very , very small population .
that &apos;s one of the reasons why i can never understand it .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you . , mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco : thank you mr. speaker .
those are accurate numbers , mr. speaker .
now i think that the concern the member has is that because we have such a low population base , is why do they seem so high .
those numbers are correct .
those numbers have been checked .
they have come forward , they haven &apos;t changed in x number of years .
my explanation maybe wasn &apos;t that good on the ratio and how those numbers are valid .
i think that &apos; s what the member is trying to get at .
maybe yourself , mr. speaker , or maybe the minister of education , with his background , could go through the ratio and percentages so it could be more understandable .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you . , mr. picco .

question 104 - 1 ( 3 ) :
telehealth systems
mr. irqittuq :
( interpretation ) thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i have a question for the minister of health and social services .
he said that even if we get the resident doctor in our community , the number of illnesses will not decrease , that was his response .
so my question is for example , setting up tvs is very important , there &apos;s a lot of telehealth systems up now , and the patient is diagnosed through the telehealth system .
are these telehealth systems better than resident doctors .
speaker :
thank you . , mr. irqittuq .
mr. picco ?
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
what a doctor does is diagnosis ... and this also applies to treatment .
the member asked a question specifically on telehealth .
i think , mr. speaker , telehealth is probably one of the most exciting technological opportunities that have come a long way for us , here in nunavut .
telehealth has proven itself in other jurisdictions across this country , and across the world .
for example , in australia , it &apos;s really taking off .
in norway , i believe in june there &apos;s going to be an international conference of circumpolar countries , on telehealth and the applications of telehealth for the circumpolar world .
in canada , many of the other provincial jurisdictions , and territorial jurisdictions , are using or experimenting with the application of telehealth .
and the doctor was asked to review this case .
they were able to stay in their community to be treated so that &apos;s one of the exciting things about telehealth .
this government is trying to move forward .
we &apos;re trying to put some money into our budget to enhance the delivery of telehealth as we explained in this house and again in the caucus last week .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. picco .
oral questions .
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
the minister &apos;s response , my question was are they better .
is telehealth better than doctors .
are you saying they are better than doctors ?
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
if you could rephrase your question , i could let you go ahead because you cannot ask the minister and i could rule you out of order .
you cannot ask him a question on the minister &apos;s feelings .
if you rephrase your question i will let you go ahead mr. irqittuq .

on the 27th , he had a minister &apos;s statement and the inuktitut translation is a little bit different than the english version .
mr. minister , he gave me a copy of his response but the inuktitut does not correspond to the english .
if that &apos;s the case then could you correct the mistake please .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .

hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :

mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
if my question is in fact true , next time around or anytime i do not want to get wrong inuktitut attachments to english .
i just want you to know that .
i didn &apos;t put a number on it , i should have but the date corresponds to your minister &apos;s statement made on the 27th .
thank you mr. speaker .

location of old dump site
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i have a question directed to the minister of community government , housing &amp; transportation .
last spring , we discussed the old dump site .
it &apos;s too close to the residential units and they may not construct units because of that and especially when the wind blows , that old dump site gets smelly .
so i was wondering what the minister has done so far .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. nutarak .
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :

multi-year plans
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker and i would like to thank the members for extending the question period .
my question is directed to the community government , housing &amp; transportation minister .
previously we had made a five year plan in the communities and then they stated that we are going to have a longer plan for 20 years .

mr. iqaqrialu
question 113 - 1 ( 3 ) :
staffing for elders societies
mr. iqaqrialu :
thank you mr. speaker .
i have a question directed to the minister of culture , language , elders &amp; youth and perhaps it &apos;s similar to what mr. nutarak asked .
the elders have societies in the majority of the communities in nunavut .
they very much require good staff , such as a secretary .
have you looked to find out if there are additional dollars for the elders &apos; societies &apos; staff .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :

minister responsible for elders mr. havioyak .

question 114 - 1 ( 3 ) :
marketing for fish
mr. irqittuq :
thank you mr. speaker .
i know that we have a limited time for question period , i will limit my question mr. speaker .
i have a question to the minister of sustainable development .
today , it seems to be harder for my communities of igloolik and hall beach to start a small business .
perhaps the minister of sustainable development can find out where we can market this fish .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
minister for sustainable development , mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
in regards to the question of marketing of arctic char , i have worked in this area for four years in pangnirtung .
the fishermen in the communities in all of nunavut have worked very hard and have met stumbling blocks in marketing their fish .
since there are rules and regulations to follow especially in the communities where there is no fish plant .
the fish has to be cleaned adequately and they have to be inspected .
one of the things that people misunderstand is that we know what arctic char is .
we like to eat it as a whole fish but the southern consumers would like to see the fish processed .
they prefer to buy processed fish .
it has been pretty hard but at least we &apos;re learning what consumers want down south .
we have to follow consumers needs .
we are aware that arctic char is very important to inuit of nunavut .
speaker :
thank you mr. kilabuk .
oral questions , mr. mclean .

rules of the assembly
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
perhaps i shall be directing my question to the premier or the speaker .
we were oriented on how to conduct ourselves in the house .
one of the things that we learned was not to move around too much from our chairs .
i think we &apos;re forgetting that and i want to be told what the status is now .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu , that &apos;s my responsibility .
we &apos;ll have to be oriented more than once .
it &apos;s now noon hour . we &apos;ll take a 30 minute recess .

hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. chairman , the purpose of the supplementary appropriation bill is to make supplementary appropriations for the government of nunavut for the fiscal year ended march 31 , 2000 .
authority is requested for a total 8 million 146 thousand in additional appropriations made up of 4 million 539 thousand for operations and maintenance and 3 million 607 thousand for capital expenditures .
a number of interdepartmental transfers are also included in the supplementary appropriations which do not require additional funding .
mr. chairman , the additional appropriations have been provided for in the estimated supplementary appropriation requirements included in the 99 / 2000 main estimates as a contingency reserve .
however they do consume much of our 10 million dollars reserve and we will have to be very vigilant over the balance of the year .
the costs incurred relative to the temporary library space and the common mechanical utilities facility in cambridge bay will be included in the insurance claim with respect to the loss of the high school .
those are my opening comments mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister ng .
thank you .
if you would like your staff to sit with you at the witness table , we will deal with bill 5 .
mr. minister if you would go up to the witness table .
thank you mr. minister , if you have staff that you would like to invite up to the witness table .
are you going to be having your staff up there ?
hon. kelvin ng :
mr. chairman , the staff were told to be here at 1 : 00 because i thought that is when they were needed .

committee motion 1 - 1 ( 3 ) :

hon. kelvin ng :

part 2 - capital , listed at 3 million 607 thousand dollars .

mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :

my question was prior to this , and i would like to apologize , can i now ask my question , mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. akesuk , for reminding me .
okay then i will ask for general comments .
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :

not previously authorized , negative 54 thousand .
agreed ? mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
could you give me an elaboration on what these negative numbers represent .
because it could be a deficit .
why is there a negative figure here .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu would like clarification on the negative number .
mr. minister .
hon. kelvin ng :
mr. chairman , this is an expenditure in establishing the decentralization secretariat and it is as a result of transferring one individual from the department of finance to the division secretariat .
so the negative would show up here and a positive would show up in the executive department later on .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister . going ahead .
page number 6 .

chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. minister .
hon. kelvin ng :
mr. chairperson , this was mentioned in an earlier question in the house from mr. o &apos;brien to the health minister .

there is a question , mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
i would like to know exactly what these monies are going to be used for .
thank you mr. speaker .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. minister .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman this again is one of the internal government transfers , it is coming from the department of education to the department of human resources .
so the programs that are intended to be delivered wouldn &apos;t change as this is a shift in responsibilities between departments .
this is the public service training program , so it is for government wide training initiatives of our staff , mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
the department of education sets the programs but now they always keep saying that they don &apos;t have enough money , how come they are transferring these dollars to a different department .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. iqaqrialu .
minister ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
maybe because i don &apos;t understand , maybe if you could explain to me i would feel better about it .
this is going to human resources from the department of education , right .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. minister , did you want to respond .
hon. kelvin ng :
yes i will try again , mr. chairman .
mr. chairman it is for a specific program for the public service commission training program for employees .
if i can use another example , later on , it might clarify it .
so it is the same type of thing , we are still delivering the housing program , it is just a transfer of the responsibilities for the budget goes from one department to another .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .

mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
i would like to know in regards to the assistant deputy minister , i thought we had assistant deputy ministers already .
there is no assistant deputy minister for this particular department .
could i get clarification on that please .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
did you want to respond to that , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
mr. chairman , the department of human resources still has an assistant deputy minister .
this particular transfer is to deal with the one assistant deputy minister , ms. aglukkaaq , that went over to the decentralization secretariat .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister ng .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i thought that there was already money in the decentralization secretariat .
i thought we already had approval on april 1 .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. minister .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
on april first we didn &apos;t have a decentralization secretariat .
thank you , mr. chairman .

hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
just to help , you should say &quot; total department &quot; , please .

mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
the total department , the total , is it 522 thousand and negative 55 thousand ?
the total is not 467 thousand .

there &apos;s a question .
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
is this essential .
that 200 is it just for that department ?
why do you need it now .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. akesuk .
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman . mr. chairman , the primary reason for it is establishing the automated personal property registry system , because the current system now lacks certainty .
it inhibits and increases the cost of commercial transactions as a result of not having an automated system .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , minister .
does that answer your question , mr. akesuk , ok .
going back to page 8 .

chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. minister , could you respond to his question , or your official ?
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , it is my understanding again is that is a couple of person years that is transferred over to the decentralization secretariat .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. ng .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :

could you tell me or elaborate to me who they are ?
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you . perhaps the premier could elaborate to him .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman we wanted to have good direction on decentralization .
that &apos;s why we established the secretariat .
our work with public works to establish our offices and the infrastructure for decentralization are now in the works and in order to give clear direction we are getting support from public works .
we &apos;re not coming up with new dollars .
we &apos;re just going to be working with the public works to establish the decentralization secretariat .
i hope i answered you , thank you .

mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
this 19 million dollars .
where did this come from ? is this new dollars , or does this come from our approved budget ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. nutarak .
minister ng .
hon. kelvin ng :

mr. chairman , this is the funding that was initially approved for community government , housing and transportation .
at that time , at the start of the year , we approved 33 million 243 thousand for operating and maintenance for the housing portion of cght .
since that approval , cght has utilized 13 million 772 thousand and this is the amount that &apos; s being transferred here .
the 19 million 471 thousand is what &apos;s left and it &apos;s going over to public works because of the transfer between departments .

mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
we take 153 thousand from 19 million 471 thousand so the total comes down to 19 million 318 thousand .
does that mean we take 153 thousand from 19 million dollars ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu has asked a question .
mr. minister .
hon. kelvin ng :

chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mla for pond inlet .
mr. minister , your response please .
hon. kelvin ng :

mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :

mr. chairman , you said 63 thousand , you weren &apos;t talking about the other numbers .
you only talked about 63 thousand , so my question was geared towards that number only .

chairperson ( interpretation ) : mr. nutarak , do you have a question .
go ahead . mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
in regards to this 19 million , this 19 million dollars was originally going to be used for the pond inlet sanitation site .
what was it for , or was this money transferred over to housing . chairperson :
minister ng . hon. kelvin ng :
mr. chairman , this 19 million 471 thousand is the exact amount that we just previously dealt with in public works .
it is a transfer of the operating and maintenance portion of the housing , it comes from community government , housing , transportation to public works .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you . , mr. hon. kelvin ng , i think we &apos;ll go ahead .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
this 19 million dollars was taken out .
is there going to be any money going back for the year 2000 ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. hon. kelvin ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
mr. chairman , this is for the current year .
it &apos;s not actually taken out , it &apos;s just being transferred from one department to another .
next years budget will be set accordingly .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. ng .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
we &apos;re doing supplementary appropriations for this year , to the end of march 31 .
on april 1 , we &apos;ll get new money .
my question was , when it becomes april , will there be money available to replenish what was taken out of the department ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you . , mr. nutarak .
mr. ng , response please .
hon. kelvin ng :
yes , mr. chairman .
no , the point would be that there would still be money for housing .
it &apos;s just that instead of being in the community government , housing and transportation budget it would be in the public works housing budget .
if that answers the member &apos;s question , thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .

are there any comments or questions .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
i assume this is the appropriate time to ask questions about the special warrants on page 17 .
mr. chairman with all the excitement or confusion over the last few minutes , i didn &apos;t have any questions before that but now i found a few as they relate to special warrants .
i would like to ask the minister to just give a definition again , we had this already , but just to refresh my memory , a definition of a special warrant .
then my question would be in relation to the 250 thousand dollars that has been identified , i believe , for a temporary library .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister ng would you like to respond .
hon. kelvin ng :
mr. chairman , a definition of a special warrant is a mechanism for advancing spending authority to allow a department to respond quickly to new or unforeseen needs that meet specific criteria .
the criteria are ;
when the legislative assembly is not in session and the board reports to the commissioner a ) that an expenditure is urgently required ;
b ) that the expenditure is in the public interest ; and c ) there is no appropriation or insufficient expenditure , the commissioner may authorize a special warrant authorizing the expenditure .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister ng .
i think mr. o &apos;brien has another question .
mr. o &apos;brien :
it indicates that the money is to provide a temporary library while the school is being built .
can the minister explain why it was necessary to have this special warrant in september when all the members were meeting just a few weeks later to discuss these issues .
why was it necessary to do it under a special warrant .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
the department of education had this and many other funding requests with the financial management board and this particular one had come forward for that september meeting and it was approved at that time .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister for your response .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman it may not seem like a large amount in the overall scheme of the project but it is significant when you look at some of the needs that we have elsewhere .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , the building is owned by the municipality .
they &apos;ve offered to provide the building , and it has become available at no lease cost so they are providing it with the understanding that the government undertakes the capital renovations .
the renovations include strengthening of the floor to permit the storage of books , upgrading the heating system and other internal modifications .
there is also a part of this 250 thousand dollars for furniture in the amount of 25 thousand dollars .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister ng .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
we still don &apos;t seem to have a complete picture on exactly how much the school is going to cost , whether it is 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 million dollars .
we don &apos;t seem to know that .
i see some other indicators here that i haven &apos;t seen before .
my question is how much insurance money are we expecting from the school that burnt down and how much is the new school actually going to cost .
will the 250 thousand dollar special warrant that is going to build the temporary library , will that be factored back into the new school .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
may we have a response please , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman there is currently an insurance claim being prepared with respect to the loss of the high school and the common mechanical utilities facility that we &apos;ll be dealing with later .
part of this mr. chairman , this claim , will include the temporary facility space that is required .
thank you . chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister .
mr. o &apos;brien . mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman . one last question , i think the whole issue sort of begs a number of questions and i understand the need to replace the school , that is understood .
the insurance that we are talking about , this is a year ago that school burnt down and we still don &apos;t have it resolved as far as the claim .
is this a self insured arrangement where the government actually pays for the school out of its own dollars or is it through an insurance company .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman it is through an insurance company but with government buildings i believe the magnitude of the deductible would be approximately 1 million dollars .
thank you . ,
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
my final question , does the minister expect that once the insurance is said and done that it will cover the costs of the new school with the costs that are indicated there .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister ng .

ikajuruti inungnik ungasiktumi network
hon. ed picco :
qujannamiik uqaqti .
mr. speaker , i rise today to thank all the members of this assembly for taking the time earlier in october to attend the demonstration of the ikajuruti inungnik ungasiktumi network .
the iiu network is a pilot project using modern computer and video technology that the department of health and social services is running right now in three baffin communities .
mr. speaker , this is an exciting development which is helping to cut waiting times and improve access to health care in nunavut .
with this technology we can help patients be diagnosed and counselled by doctors , psychiatrists and other specialists more quickly and without the inconvenience of travelling to iqaluit or the south .
this type of satellite linkup between doctors and patients is already practiced successfully in several canadian provinces and other countries world-wide .
right now we are running the iiu network in cape dorset , pond inlet and iqaluit .
i am pleased to tell you that we are hoping to expand this service into rankin and arviat early next year .
mr. speaker , as a government we are all committed to the health of our people and to making the best possible use of the resources available to us .
i believe that telehealth is just one of the tools that we can use to make health care and social services more accessible and more effective for the people of nunavut .
we look forward to tentatively expanding the iiu network into rankin and arviat next year and i will keep this house appraised as the project develops .
qujannamiik uqaqti .

nunavut arts council
hon. donald havioyak :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker i appreciate this opportunity to speak about the nunavut arts council .
every jurisdiction in canada has an arts council that works in co-operation with both the government and the artistic community .
the best way to distribute these funds is through the guidance and recommendations of skilled , experienced , specialists .
a nunavut arts council is best suited to advise on the needs of the artists of nunavut .
the council will also create a forum for nunavut &apos;s artistic community . this forum will allow artists a direct and unified voice for requesting support and providing recommendations to the government .
the nunavut art council supports our government &apos;s desire to increase public representation by involving more people in the decision making process .
the department of culture , language , elders &amp; youth is proud to announce that we will table the art council appointments before the end of november .
there are several improvements that the residents of nunavut can expect when the arts council is formed .
they can expect having arts funding decided upon through a fair process that includes the artistic community .

passing of remi murray
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker it is good to be back in this house .
i would like to take this opportunity to apologize to the constituents of iqaluit centre for not having been in the assembly last week .
mr. speaker , remi murray , or &quot; deets &quot; as everyone knew him as , was a metis and a respected member of his community .
he was especially renowned for his counselling and traditional healing abilities .
the strength of our families in the communities , our desire to seek consensus and not discord will lead us forward .
i know , mr. speaker , that my uncle took a profound interest in what we are accomplishing here .
i know mr. speaker , that he is still watching down on me and my family .
i again commit myself to living up to what he expected of me , what my constituents expect of me and what my honourable colleagues in this house expect of me .

process used for time zone change
( note :
technical problems , recording partially inaudible )
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i rise today to talk about inuit qaujimajatuqangit and how it is integrated to the workings of the government .
however , the process used for bill 3 has reversed the purpose of integrating inuit qaujimajatuqangit into government practices .
it has broken the spirit and intent of inuit qaujimajatuqangit .
the government of canada has gone over the heads of the nunavut legislature with their passage of the regulation to change the time zone .
this is the reason that we will discuss again today the issue of the time zone change when we resume the business of the house today .
we need to discuss what is in the best interest of the residents of nunavut .
we will need to discuss also the adverse effects of this change to our constituents .

concerns of regular members over time zone change
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
mr. speaker , i rise today as the chairperson of the regular members &apos; caucus to make an important statement on behalf of the regular members .
we have a strong concern about the way the time zone issue has been handled by the government .
our concern , mr. speaker , is that we do not believe that the government informed us clearly and openly about how it planned to proceed with putting the time zone change into effect .
we were encouraged by the commitments made by the government in pinasuaqtavut - the bathurst inlet mandate , about openness , co-operation and respect for mlas .
the statement declares that co-operation will be the operating standard at every level and that mlas will be respected as important sources of community opinion .
however , the committee never received the courtesy of a formal response .
regular members are also very concerned that the way the government chose to implement the time zone change was by regulations which were made and passed behind closed doors .
the way this came about seems to have bypassed the legislative assembly .
the government appears to have assumed that just because it had the legal power to make these regulatory changes , the members would pass bill 3 without question .
we now have learned that the necessary regulations were passed in early september by the nunavut government and in early october by the federal government .
as recently as last friday , some regular members were under the impression that delaying the passage of bill 3 would delay the implementation of the time zone changes .
the regulations were already made before our current session even began .
our caucus feels that this should have been clearly disclosed to us and the public by the government .
the result is that many regular members are feeling that they have had no voice in this important matter .
some members were feeling that this legislative assembly is not important and they are concerned that the cabinet may be able to use its power and authority in this way again .
they are concerned that they have had no opportunity to voice concerns and questions from their communities ;
and that those questions and concerns have been treated in a dismissive manner .
mr. speaker , the regular members do not want this to happen again .
we also ask the government from now on to treat regular members with the spirit of openness , co-operation and respect which has been promised in pinasquaqtavut .
thank you , mr. speaker .

first of all i would like to thank you mr. speaker for going to pangnirtung and mr. okalik , our premier .

i would like to thank the members for going to pangnirtung yesterday for commemoration in memory of the individuals who had died ( inaudible ) november 1st .
this ceremony was aired on a cbc program called igalaaq and it was also broadcast on cbc radio .
yesterday , we gave an ( inaudible ) item that could be used by the students of aluki school in memory of charlie koonilusie who had died at the age of 10 .
the hunting party perished during a vicious storm .
during the commemoration these victims , i also would like to thank the pangnirtung residents who have been very co-operative ..

on friday , although i really did not enjoy friday , it was quite funny for some though i will not go into the details .
i &apos;d like to speak on bill 3 because the mlas have been working very hard on the time change issue .
i was so happy that bill 3 didn &apos;t get passed on friday but i didn &apos;t realize that the time change was going to go ahead anyway .
but while i have the opportunity mr. speaker , i will speak to the issue further when we start dealing with bill 3 .

question 42 - 1 ( 3 ) contractors use of government equipment
hon. kelvin ng :
mr. speaker i have two returns on behalf of the hon. manitok thompson .
the first ;
on october 26 , 1999 , mr. irqittuq asked ms. thompson if the nunavut government is allowing contractors to use government infrastructure to carry out their contracts .
mr. speaker , when a contractor obtains a contract from the government , they &apos;re not supposed to use government infrastructure to carry out their contracts .
thank you , mr. speaker .
return 03 - 1 ( 3 ) :
question 67 - 1 ( 3 ) :
lack of aviation fuel
the member requested information as to why there was no aviation fuel in the communities of repulse bay and pelly bay .
mr. speaker , with regards to repulse bay , the department has placed drums of aviation fuel in this community this past re-supply season .
however , this fuel is for emergency medivac purposes only .
certified bulk aviation fuel is available to aircraft in the surrounding three communities of rankin inlet , coral harbour and baker lake for requirements other than emergencies .
mr. speaker , with regard to pelly bay , the department has a two year agreement in place with the canadian coast guard for sea lift purposes .
the capability of the coast guard tanker to move fuel products to this community is restricted to one product , so only p50 fuel is transported to pelly bay .
given the extreme cost of airlifting additional types of fuel to this community we have not chosen to locate aviation fuel in pelly bay at this time .
having said that mr. speaker , it should also been pointed out that there have been no requests from aircraft companies to position certified aviation fuel in pelly bay .
airlift companies are currently using the p50 fuel in pelly bay as an acceptable alternative to certified aviation fuel .
p50 fuel is historically cheaper than certified aviation fuel .
the air companies are quite satisfied .
additionally mr. speaker , those companies who would rather use certified aviation fuel can obtain this type of fuel from their alternates such as hall beach , taloyoak , igloolik and gjoa haven .

question 45 - 1 ( 3 ) proper spelling of names
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to make a response to an oral question raised by mr. o &apos;brien on october 26 , 1999 , concerning the proper spelling of names .
mr. speaker , the spelling of people &apos;s names is a very important issue that we cannot rush into or begin to solve overnight .
there is a long history to learn from and the department of culture , language , elders &amp; youth has begun working towards addressing everyone &apos;s concerns .
i envision a nunavut wide public awareness campaign informing people of their options for making changes to their name .
we know that the people of nunavut are responsible and accountable for their own well-being .
our role is to provide awareness of this issue and to provide choices for people who want to change their name .
mr. speaker , on this sensitive and difficult issue my deputy minister is developing a working plan that would be implemented over the next two years .
in the strategy sessions , it may be advisable to have input from the nunavut law review committee and nunavut tunngavik incorporated , as 85 percent of our population are inuit .
mr. speaker , from these actions my department will also develop an options paper that will outline the strategies we wish to propose .
it is my desire to consult with the members and work together on establishing what it is that should be done .

return 05 - 1 ( 3 ) : adult educator for hall beach
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
this is a return to an oral question asked by mr. irqittuq on the arctic college centre .
the nunavut arctic college centre has been without the services of an adult educator for the month of september and october .
therefore , there were no programs running at the nac building .
nac realizes the need for adult education services for the community of hall beach and has hired susan leblanc who started on october 25th , 1999 .
the college will be delivering an adult basic education course as well as providing other services to the community , such as career counselling , testing and assessments .
the college will be working with many community organizations to develop a training plan for the community and seek alternate funding to fund these programs .
susan leblanc is looking forward to having the opportunity to work with the community and help deliver the programs that they request .

return to an oral question on friday , october 29th from the member for nattilik in regards to the gjoa haven fish plant .
the department has reviewed the proposal for the gjoa haven fish plant and staff are now examining the cost estimates .
the plant will require significant capital investments to upgrade it .
this funding has not yet been identified within the department &apos;s budget .
the department staff in the kitikmeot region are currently examining the option of incorporating the fish plant into the operations of nunavut development corporation .
the president of the nunavut development corporation will be provided with a copy of the gjoa haven proposal and discussions with the nunavut development corporation are expected to take place this winter .

purchase of country food from kivalliq communities
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
since i spoke in inuktitut , so that enoki would hear , i will provide this response in english .
( interpretation ends ) this response is to an oral question asked on friday , october 29th , by the member from baker lake on the purchase of country food from the kivalliq communities .
at the present time the keewatin fish and meat plant in rankin can only purchase caribou from coral harbour .
this is the only community that has a large enough quota to conduct a federally inspected commercial harvest .
the community has a quota of 6 thousand commercial tags , the communities of arviat , baker lake , chesterfield inlet , repulse bay , whale cove have a total tag allocation of 925 .
this does not make it economical to conduct a federal harvest in these communities .
the keewatin fish &amp; meat plant is purchasing about 40 thousand pounds of arctic char from rankin inlet , chesterfield inlet and whale cove .
as markets for these products increase , the keewatin fish &amp; meat plant will look at purchasing arctic char from the other communities in the keewatin region .
i am advised that the nunavut development corporation is currently examining options for increasing their processing capacity and the opportunities for increasing market demand for caribou .

speaker :

hon. ed picco :

mr. speaker , i appreciate the member clarifying the question .
the group homes that we have placements in , i believe the member &apos;s original question was what is the cost to operate those facilities .
those facilities are operated , as the member and the house know , in most cases , by the regional health boards .
in some cases they are actually on a contract basis , by a private corporation and in some cases a non-profit society .

manitoba to keewatin power grid
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
also in that study was the possibility of a road link between churchill manitoba and the keewatin .
i am not sure if the minister can speak to the road linkage but possibly to the status of the power grid preliminary studies .
basically what were the results and also if there is a possibility of moving onto the next step , which would be a more detailed analysis of this particular issue .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister responsible for the nunavut power corporation , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , the report that the member talks about , mr. speaker , came from manitoba hydro and it was a pre-feasibility study .
now , my understanding is that it was a pre-feasibility study , that it is broad in its implications and that indeed , it made some assumptions .
for example , my understanding after reading the report is that one of these assumptions was that every home in rankin inlet , whale cove and arviat would switch to electric heat .
so that would be some major cost implications if that occurred .

mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my second question to the minister .
mr. speaker , the premier earlier in our mandate spoke very positively and was very supportive of a road link between churchill manitoba and the keewatin and also about a possible power grid .
my question to the minister is ;
will the minister be supporting the next step , which is a detailed analysis of these particular projects .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister responsible for the nunavut power corporation , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :

thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
final supplementary mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , in the report , can the minister tell us whether it indicated that there would be true cost savings if this hydro line would be put in place .
it is my understanding that in my region , we are paying up to 70 cents per kilowatt hour , where in manitoba , they are paying 6 cents .
the approximate cost of this grid would be in the neighbourhood of 180 million dollars over a 20 or 25 year period .
can the minister indicate whether or not in the report it did show a saving .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister responsible for the nunavut power corporation , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker the report is a weighty volume , it is a very thick document .
there are several assumptions made in the report .
the cost to the customer would be 30 cents per kilowatt hour .
now , mr. speaker , when we say the potential mines , that i would assume would be the nettiling project and possibly the project near mr. mclean &apos;s riding in baker lake .
in that case it would be 12 cents per kilowatt hour and the cost to the customer would be 25 cents per kilowatt hour .
again , mr. speaker , we have to predicate these assumptions by saying that this is a pre-feasibility study .

question 120 - 1 ( 3 ) :
cost per patient at health boarding homes
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to direct this question to the minister of health &amp; social services .
patient &apos;s going down to ottawa usually stay in boarding homes .
how much do they pay per patient for the boarding home in ottawa .
i would like to know how much a patient costs per night in these accommodations .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i thank the member for the question .
it is a good question .
unlike the other two regions , the keewatin region and the kitikmeot region , we don &apos;t have a boarding home specific facility in ottawa .
what we are using right now is a facility called the rotel .
the rotel is operated by the ohsni group and it is used for patients going to ottawa , using the ottawa general hospital and some of the other hospital facilities in ottawa .
patients from ontario and other jurisdictions that need to go to ottawa also use the rotel .
so it is not actually a nunavut specific facility .

it is contingency depending on departmental needs , such as the health boards .
that &apos;s one of the first orders of business that will have to be resolved post-session , mr. speaker .
so it &apos;s for those types of situations where the contingency would come into play and going through the proper channels for a request and going to the financial management board for approval .

caribou marketing for baffin region
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is to the minister of sustainable development .
when you read your presentation earlier , about the market for the caribou and taking into account all the nunavut regions , the caribou are also in the baffin region .
what kind of economic activity can arise for these .

at the same time there was no program in place to hire summer students .
can the minister explain why this didn &apos;t happen , why we have 1.4 million dollars not spent that was ear-marked for summer employment for youth , why this didn &apos;t occur ?

hon. kelvin ng :
mr. speaker , once again i &apos;ll try to explain .
it was based on expenditures up to september 30 , plus the projected expenditures to get us to the end of the fiscal year .

mr. speaker , first let &apos;s clarify .
there were students employed over the course of the summer but they were not specifically funded by programs to municipalities or to housing associations or to businesses or non-profit organizations .
they happened to be government of nunavut casual employees over the course of the summer .
once again i would say to the member it &apos;s because there was no specific program outline and funding approved for summer students .

question 127 - 1 ( 3 ) :
cost per patient in rotel
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i &apos;m going to re-elaborate the question i asked previously to the minister of health and social services .
mr. iqaqrialu asked a question in regards to the rotel which is used by the patients .
the minister stated that the contract is for another year .
my question is , with that contract how much does it cost per patient .
i hope i have made myself clearer .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. nutarak .
the minister responsible for health , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the balance of the amount depends on how many patients actually use the service at the rotel .
like i said before it is 124 dollars per night that we pay through nhip .
out of that comes other service fees for facilitating the development and the usage of the rotel .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
oral questions , mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
question to the minister of health and social services , once again .
the patient &apos;s that have gone down , how are they provided transportation down in ottawa ?
do they take taxi cabs to go to and from point a to point b , for example from the airport to the hotel or to the hospital ?
i would like to get clarification on that please .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
minister responsible for health and social services , mr. picco .

reports of standing and special committees
ajauqtiit standing committee report on the information and privacy commissioner of nunavut
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i have the honour of presenting the report on the information and privacy commissioner of nunavut .
this report was prepared by the standing committee - ajauqtiit , after we conducted a thorough selection process to identify the most appropriate candidates for this important public office .
as the report states , our standing committee worked very hard to make sure that our selection process was thorough and unbiased .
we conducted in person interviews of three candidates , reviewed their written answers and questions , and evaluated their experience and education as outlined in their resumes .
we also received information from references for the final candidate .
it was a very difficult decision for members because all of the candidates are very committed people .
they were all interested in the position and they all have many skills and ideas to bring to the position .
we thank them for applying .
nevertheless , we had to choose one name to recommend to the members of the legislative assembly .
the information and privacy commissioner for nunavut must have many qualities .
the commissioner must be a strong , committed voice for open government , which provides timely access to information and at the same time be an advocate for the protection of privacy .
we believe that elaine keenan bengts has these qualities .
we see no conflict with her holding both positions .
and there may be cost savings to both of our governments .
she will represent both the nwt and nunavut in meetings with other information and privacy commissioners across canada elsewhere .
elaine understands the challenges facing the government of nunavut and our need to be resourceful in meeting the requirements under the act in a most cost effective manner .
her office will be accessible to the residents of nunavut through a toll free line and all materials will be developed in the official languages of nunavut .
thank you , mr. speaker .
at the appropriate time , i will give notice of motion to appoint an information and privacy commissioner .

reports of standing and special committees .
mr. akesuk ?
standing committee on government operations and services report on the 1999-2000 six month departmental progress
mr. akesuk :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i have the honour today to present the standing committee on government operations and services report on the 1999-2000 six month departmental progress .
i am going to read the first two pages and then david is going to read the next two pages .
in may of 1999 , the standing committees of the legislative assembly of nunavut recommended in the house that government of nunavut departments provide mid-year progress updates to the committees for review .
ministers and senior departmental officials appeared before the standing committees from october 14-16 , 1999 .
this exercise took place shortly before the opening of the third session of the legislative assembly , and the tabling of the bathurst mandate .
at the mid-point of the 1999-2000 fiscal year , the standing committees were interested in gaining a picture of where the new government stood in terms of spending to date ;
legislative and policy plans and priorities for the remainder of the fiscal year ;
staffing progress ;
and other matters .
unfortunately , standing committees were again disappointed by the fact that departments were inconsistent in the manner in which materials were provided to committee members .
while some departments provided thorough documentation , others did not .
few departments seemed able or willing to provide materials much in advance of ministerial presentations .
problems with providing even short documents in both inuktitut and english were evident in some presentations .
the standing committee again recommends that departmental materials be provided to members sufficiently in advance of appearances to allow for adequate preparation ;
and that all materials be fully translated .
mr. speaker , generally speaking , the standing committee on government operations and services was satisfied with the progress to date made by the three departments under its oversight mandate .
this report will serve to highlight the standing committee &apos;s main observations and concerns .
department of executive and intergovernmental affairs
premier okalik appeared before the standing committee on october 14 .
the standing committee is pleased with the efforts being made to develop sound working relationships with other jurisdictions , while ensuring that nunavut &apos;s interests are effectively articulated .
protocol agreement between the government of nunavut and nunavut tunngavik incorporated
members of the standing committee were provided the opportunity to review the protocol .
the standing committee is supportive of this initiative to establish a sound working relationship between the government and nti ;
while recognizing the special role of the standing committee ajauqtiit in considering issues related to the government of nunavut &apos;s obligations with respect to the implementation of the nunavut land claims agreement .
decentralization secretariat
the standing committee received a brief update on the work of the secretariat , and took note that a total of 69 decentralized positions have been filled to date .
the standing committee reiterates its fundamental support for decentralization , and strongly recommends that the work of the secretariat proceed in an effective and timely fashion .
the standing committee also recommends that the elected local leadership of communities impacted by decentralization receive formal updates on a monthly basis from the secretariat .
nunavut law review commission ( maligarnik qimirrujiit )
members are supportive of this important initiative .
public utilities board
members are aware of the government &apos;s work in reviewing options in this area .
the standing committee supports the establishment of a nunavut public utilities board at the earliest opportunity .

mr. iqaqrialu :
thank you , mr. speaker .
report on 1999-2000 six month departmental progress update .
minister ng appeared before the standing committee on october 14 .
mid-year fiscal update
the standing committee is pleased that the government does not anticipate a deficit for 1999-2000 .
however , members of the committee are concerned about the drop in projected personal and corporate income tax revenues , given that the committee shares the minister &apos;s commitment to greater financial self-reliance .
the standing committee recommends any government-wide surplus be allocated to address nunavut &apos;s housing crisis .
division of assets and liabilities
the standing committee was informed that the final status of this process will not be known until later this year .
the standing committee continues to take a strong interest in this issue , and expects to be regularly updated .
pay equity
while supporting the principle of pay equity , the standing committee is concerned that the government take the appropriate steps to cover potential liabilities as a result of the ongoing tribunal process in ottawa .
departmental staffing progress
the standing committee recognizes efforts being made by the department to meet inuit employment plan targets , while acknowledging the need to build skills and capacity .
the standing committee recommends that the department continue to make efforts to foster training opportunities in partnership with educational institutions in these skill areas .
public-private partnerships
members of the committee take a strong interest in the direction that the government will take with respect to p3s ;
especially with respect to the issues of transparency and accountability .
the standing committee recommends that it be consulted as the department moves forward on this issue , and prior to final p3 criteria being established .
budget consultations
department of human resources
given the impending termination of nuhrds funding , the standing committee further recommends that every effort be made to successfully obtain necessary resources from federal partners . inuit qaujimajatuqangit and the public service
the standing committee looks forward to progress reports on the success of these initiatives , and emphasizes its support for a public service that is representative of the people of nunavut .

ajauqtiit standing committee report on the 1999-2000 six month departmental progress updates
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker . mr. speaker , i have the honour today of presenting the standing committee on ajauqtiit &apos;s report on the 1999-2000 six month departmental progress updates .
i &apos;ll be going over part of the report and the honourable member , mr. iqaqrialu , will be doing some as well .
it is noted that no departments provided materials in advance of their meetings with the respective standing committees .
in addition , only a few departments actually presented information on expenditures to date , such as were provided by the legislative assembly .
however , most departments did have their materials in english and inuktitut .
the standing committee again recommends that the departmental materials be provided to members sufficiently in advance of their appearance to allow for adequate presentation and that all materials be fully translated .
it is still difficult to project accurately with this budget , because as noted in may , the budget was estimated for nunavut based on the nwt .
we cannot yet assess if the amounts for the year will be sufficient .
however , it was noted that as of september 30 , the session expenses were higher because of the higher costs of operating in temporary and rented premises in april and may and june .
the committee costs were lower as fewer committee meetings have been held .
nevertheless , it is clear that there will be some slippage in areas where the positions have not yet been filled - for example , the languages commissioner and her staff .
these savings will be applied to other expenses which were not planned in the budget , such as opening celebrations for the legislative assembly building .
at the half way point of the fiscal year , just under 40 per cent of the budget has been spent or committed .
therefore , it does not appear that a supplementary budget appropriation will be necessary for the legislative assembly .
the one area where there may need to be a supplementary appropriation is for the expenses relating to the building security and janitorial services .
members were advised that the audio-visual system is being installed , but is still behind schedule , due to delays in the delivery of specialized equipment .
the clerk noted that an interim system had been installed , to ensure that this session - october - november , would proceed ... and arrangements had been made for renting interpretation equipment .
members were further advised that the audio visual system should be in place by the end of november .
members reluctantly acknowledged that these capital expenses must therefore come out of nunavut &apos;s capital budget for this fiscal year .
members were especially pleased that elders were being invited from each of nunavut &apos;s constituencies for the opening .
nevertheless , members were concerned at the lack of space for the public in the chamber .
this is always a greater concern at special events like openings .
the standing committee recommends that the speaker present options for ensuring that the public will have access to the chamber when in session .
if these options would require additional capital expenditures such as renovations , or an addition , or additional audio visual expenses , these should be put forward in the five year capital planning exercise .
members were also advised that the legislative assembly website was up internally and that the shelves had been established and were waiting for data .
members were being asked to provide updated information on their own biographies .
soon , hansard , bills , committee reports , member profiles , will be available to anyone with internet access .
this was due to the fact that the groups planning for nunavut forgot to put a legislative assembly in the plans .
as a result , there were some features which were not able to meet all the needs of the legislative assembly .
for example , it was not possible to have a large public gallery .
members felt it would be prudent to begin now to start planning for the time that a new building would be required .
for example , they wondered if a reserve could be set aside each year for the next ten , or fifteen or twenty years .
members do not want the same mistake to be made wherein the need to consider a legislative assembly building is an afterthought .
i &apos;ll turn over the next part of the report to my colleague , the honourable member for uqqumiut .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you , mr. tootoo .
member for uqqumiut .
mr. iqaqrialu .
sessional and standing committee expenses
mr. iqaqrialu :
thank you , mr. speaker .
as requested in the may report , members were given detailed information about the cost of one day of session and one day of committee &apos;s work .
it was noted that for the sake of tracking the overall budget was divided amongst the four standing committees and the management and services board .
expenditures on behalf of the members .
it was noted that an orientation workshop in iqaluit had been provided for members &apos; constituency assistants and that most members now have offices established with computers , etc .
in response to a question , it was noted that if members wished computer training , this will be provided by legislative assembly staff .
mr. speaker noted that the legislative assembly has now contracted with a local service provider for hansard , which is produced in both english and inuktitut .
appointments to offices under the jurisdiction of the legislative assembly and related legislation
it was noted in may meetings , there are several key appointments made on the recommendation of the legislative assembly , whose budget fall under the legislative assembly .
the standing committee of ajauqtiit has been co-ordinating the process of selecting names to recommend to the legislative assembly which is hoped will happen this session for the following three positions :
language commissioner , conflict of interest commissioner and information and privacy commissioner .
the standing committee of ajauqtiit will present separate reports to the house with respect to these appointments .
it was noted that once these commissioners are in place , the standing committee of ajauqtiit has reviewed the need for legislative reform in these three areas .
members were advised that the report on the first nunavut election held on february 15 , 1999 would be tabled during this session .
afterwards , the standing committee on ajauqtiit will be asked to review it and any recommendations therein .
as noted above , the members will also review the need for legislative reform to ensure the elections act is appropriate for nunavut .
other initiatives
it was noted that the legislative process had been agreed upon and that members were now working with it .
in particular the legislative process provides that the draft bills be provided to the appropriate standing committee for comment prior to introduction in the legislative assembly .
this process will be reviewed once the members have had the opportunity to work with it over the course of the session .
in terms of other legislative initiatives in the legislative assembly , it was noted that a consultation process had been initiated for symbols for nunavut .
these symbols will be reviewed by the legislative assembly .
it was agreed in baker lake that there would be no changes to the flag act .
however , it is anticipated that symbols for the official flower and other symbols for nunavut will be selected in the near future as part of this process .
clarification of roles and relationships on land claims matters
in the may , 1999 report , the standing committee of ajauqtiit expressed the wish to clarify how the different government departments and the different standing committees would work on land claims matters .
the committee has been advised that a draft protocol with nti is being worked on by the office of the premier and executive and intergovernmental affairs .
the committee has expressed its wish to be consulted during this protocol and hopes that this protocol will help clarify this relationship .
inuit qaujimajatuqangit
members were pleased to hear the continuing developments by the legislative assembly to ensure a role for inuit qaujimajatuqangit in its systems .
as well , members want to celebrate inuit culture and language in the work of the assembly .
now that the legislative assembly building is finished , there is a permanent home for the public display of the mace and other symbols of the assembly which are unique to nunavut .
the clerk advised that elders and youth would play a role in the opening of the new chamber .
non inuktitut speaking staff look forward to taking inuktitut classes established through the human resources department .
legislative assembly staff also participated in an iq workshop organized by the department of culture , language , elders &amp; youth and hope to follow up on the recommendations that emerge from that workshop .

mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the standing committee of ajauqtiit continues to operate .
in the words of one of our members our first year as a new legislature is going to be a learning experience and we &apos;ll be identifying issues .
i think it was during the june session that we said we wanted to operate more effectively and more accountably as a new legislature .
we want to think about how we would want to see our legislature be different than the nwt .
i think at some point we need to review how we are doing and where we want to see changes .
we are pleased with the progress of the legislative assembly and look forward to continuing to play a role in reviewing it &apos;s work and ensuring it is appropriate to the needs of nunavut .

comments or questions to the motion .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , the wording in this clause , indicates that there is a lack of staff housing in only iqaluit .
i can only assume that there are many communities where there is a lack of staff housing .
shouldn &apos;t it say where there is a lack of staff housing in all communities .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
that &apos;s a very good question .
would members of the ajauqtiit committee like to respond .
mr. akesuk .

chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. akesuk .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .

how we doing so far .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
the motion was moved but there is an amendment to the motion .
so what is the wish of the committee .
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk :
i move that the committee recommends that the government addresses the issue of the lack of staff housing in nunavut communities that require it .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. akesuk , just read the amendment to the motion .
would you like to see the amendment written .

chairperson ( interpretation ) :
there is a motion to defer the motion from the member for uqqumiut .
would you like to deal with the motion this afternoon or tomorrow .
you have two options , this afternoon or tomorrow .

we &apos;ll now go to the committee of the whole to deal with bill 3 .

mr. minister do you have any opening comments .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i would like to speak on behalf of the minister since he is not here .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
could you proceed to the witness table .
mr. premier are you going to invite your officials .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
yes , mr. illupalik is going to be coming here to help me , i &apos;m just teasing .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
general comments to bill 3 .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i don &apos;t really have a presentation for this bill , just a brief summary . this idea is not new and we have been seeking options for the benefit of nunavut .
we are trying to remove barriers as representatives of nunavummiut . what i was trying to seek was what would best represent nunavummiut .
this has been dealt with for quite some time now and we have not been the only ones who have dealt with it .
the mayors of all the nunavut communities have dealt with it , nti has dealt with it .
this is an issue that began in discussions in the month of april and this is just part of our mandate and we have many other issues to take on .
this is an issue that effects communities and we also have other issues such as decentralization , and we will want to deal with staff in all of nunavut .
it is almost 6 o &apos;clock and it is the same time in all the nunavut areas .
this has a big impact on all nunavummiut because this is the first time we have taken responsibility and will have a shared time zone .
this will have certain benefits ;
we can now have better working relationships because of this single time zone , irrespective of whether you are in the west or the keewatin or from this region .
the single time zone will benefit you and if you want to work with us we will be a participant .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
we &apos;re still under general comments .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
if this act receives assent on or before october 31 , 1999 this act comes into force the day it was enacted .
i &apos;m going back to the first one where the commissioner of nunavut by and with the advice and consent of the legislative assembly .
the members of the legislative assembly did not deal with this bill , bill 3 so therefore it did not follow the proper procedures because it has a negative impact on the people .
the members of the legislative assembly have not had a chance to consult with their constituencies in regards to this single time zone .
so , that &apos;s where the problem occurs , with us .
it has a negative impact for that reason .
i just wanted to point that out .
i know there are other general comments around the floor .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. premier would you like to respond .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
in august we stated that also .
the regulations have been worked on since september 30 and myself , i have publicized that changes to the regulations of the nunavut government and the federal government were made already .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i think we have discussed this here .
i just wanted to state that as a supplementary .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
if you wish to respond mr. premier .
we can only deal with odd hours if you are from cambridge bay or if you are from iqaluit .
we will probably be able to consider this again if a real problem did arise because of the new time zone .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
according to my list of members who wish to speak i &apos;ll start with mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
bill 3 was it in english , inuktitut and french .
i think it would be advisable if bill 3 was in all these three languages .
so i &apos;m asking the premier if this was done .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
isn &apos;t it in three languages ?
what are you saying ?
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. nutarak would you like to clarify your question .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
i believe we should have it in four versions .
if it &apos;s in four languages and dialectal versions we would be able to pass it but it is only in 3 versions and we cannot pass it .
i just want clarification on that .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
does anybody wish to deliver a response ?
mr. nutarak if it is appropriate with you maybe the legal advisor for nunavut can give a response to you .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
i have no problem with who answers it because i just want clarification on that .
ms. cooper :
thank you mr. chairman .
the legal requirement for the proper passage of the bill is that it be introduced in two languages ;
english and french but certainly in my book it has the bill in four languages mr. nutarak .
i &apos;m not sure if yours does .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. cooper .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
i &apos;ll pass this again to ms. cooper for a response .
ms. cooper :
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. cooper .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
maybe to be brief with my comments .
it is written in an english version and also i believe in french and inuktitut .
i haven &apos;t seen the inuinnaqtuun version that &apos;s just my point .
as it says , the central standard time as i asked earlier , what exactly does it mean .
on the inuktitut version if we have kitikmeot standard time , yes , there would be a difference of one hour .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
it is making reference to the central time zone .
it is obvious the inuktitut version needs to be revised because in the english version you have central standard time , but the wording in inuktitut refers to kitikmeot standard time .
we have two different versions , english and french but they have to be available in the regions so they &apos;ll have to be revised as to the exact wording .
that was just a supplementary .
if it can be revised , i would like to recommend that it be revised .
if the premier wants to revise , then i &apos;ll agree with him including the whole content of bill 3 .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
as soon as it &apos;s assented it will be in full force after october 31 .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
as i mentioned earlier the different languages should correlate to each other .
if it was stated in inuktitut then i would agree with the premier .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
yes , the translation requires amendment so that it can correlate with the english version .
we can deal with that here , and we are here to deal with it .
the english is clear and self explanatory .
the translation should just follow the english version .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
i did a have a question .
i want to give other members an opportunity to voice their concerns as well .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i agreed with a single time zone in the previous days .
this bill was tabled in april and i agree with all the reasons why this was brought up however , today i understand the public &apos;s concern .
in inuktitut , it &apos;s literally two hours .
this is the very first time that we can actually speak to this issue for those of us representing constituents from the baffin region .
we were able to discuss this during our member &apos;s statements but we were not allowed to ask questions to the issue .
for that reason , the people are concerned about the fact that they were not involved .
they were not even consulted regarding the time change .
they have petitioned against it and these petitions were tabled at the house during the official session .
many people have signed them .
when we went down to item 10 , petitions , during our tabling of documents , item 13 in our orders of the day , we were tabling petitions and tabling documents .
in regards to this issue , these are some of the things that we &apos;ve done .
perhaps the petitions that came from the baffin are useless .
it didn &apos;t even last an hour as our clerk had told us that even without the passage of bill 3 our clocks would still turn back .
none of the regular members were smiling .
all the faces changed drastically
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
does that mean that the government is going to control the inuit now ?
is the government never going to consider the concerns of the people ?
i know that this is going to create a lot of conflict .
it &apos;s already to started to create conflict with the government .
the kitikmeot and keewatin are happy because there &apos;s no negative impact with the time change but for those of us who live in the baffin region have felt the impact .
and so therefore there &apos;s quite a lot of opposition throughout baffin island .
if we don &apos;t listen to the people of nunavut , we &apos;re not preparing their future .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
we have to follow the rules .
you cannot as a person in the gallery , please be patient .
you cannot cheer or do any clapping in the house .
please follow the rules accordingly .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
these are the issues i wanted to bring forward .
the population of baffin island is the majority of nunavut and when we are given something that we oppose , there &apos;s room and we have the right to oppose .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you . mr. irqittuq .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
as i have stated before , we had set this up through the regulations and we tabled this information out to the public with the authority that was invested in us .
if we didn &apos;t change the time , it would be going onto 7 : 00 .
i just want to remind everybody that we changed our clocks back an hour and i would like to work with all the members when we are consulting with all the communities .
we have other issues to deal with too so we should move onto other topics .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
nowadays we have high technology .
we are not opposing the single time zone for nunavut .
igloolik residents and hall beach residents are not opposing the single time zone .
one thing that they have been requesting was that the single time zone should have followed the eastern standard time .
that way we would have had a unified hour all across nunavut .
that was the request in these communities .
we would have had less impact with the kitikmeot .
keewatin and baffin would have been happy that way .
so we do have this high technology .
we have better technology than gnwt had .
therefore at this time , in my community i know that it &apos;s the dark season but with this new time change we will be getting dark at noon hour .
that &apos;s the impact that we are feeling in my community .
our school students will be going to school after lunch , very dark and it &apos;s the middle of winter and it &apos;s very cold outside .
these are the things that we have to contend with .
we understand that we literally moved the time by one hour but it &apos;s pretty hard to convince my constituents because they are voicing their concerns .
if we go to igloolik , they will be reiterating what i &apos;m saying .
it &apos;s pretty hard to convince them .
i cannot convince my people personally so i &apos;m representing my constituency and that &apos;s why i &apos;m voicing my concerns .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
perhaps in consideration of the premier has been saying , i don &apos;t think a different response will be made .
i have two more names on my list .
i believe you are next mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
his colleagues are probably in the same boat and this is creating a problem .
for example , our premier is the spokesperson in the media .
the qikiqtaaluk inuit are trying to state their views and he &apos;s overriding them .
as such , when he &apos;s asked , he keeps referring back to the need to experiment and this is seems to be the only response he can give .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
going back to bill 3 , the amendments , we &apos;re talking about the interpretation act .
please keep onto the topics .
i would suggest that you keep to the topic .
perhaps our premier has another comment to make .
do you have a response for mr. iqaqrialu comments ?
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
we did want to discuss it as a whole but we didn &apos;t have any time to do so and we did want to further discuss this during our session .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
that would be great .
we do want to make changes in the communities that have decided not to go along with the time zone .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
i received a copy and i said earlier that we have to abide by house rules .
the individual in the gallery handed me a note apologizing for their actions earlier .
thank you .
mr. nutarak ..
maybe a last comment .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
bill 3 , i was a bit confused .
are we finished with this .
we have not even voted on this .

doreen and stanley kenalogak fell through the ice and norman and diane haqpi were travelling quite a few kilometres behind them and happened upon them .

member &apos;s statement 75 - 1 ( 3 ) :
support for smaller communities
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
there is a newspaper article that talks about our community &apos;s deficit .
we have to give the smaller communities our full support , especially as members of the legislative assembly .
the community requires support and assistance , especially at the point where they are getting into a deficit .
i do not mind this report here , but i do not like to see these types of situations , especially when the nunavut government is quite new .
so we will have to rectify the situation , especially with the smaller communities , we have to protect all the communities equally .

retirement of mathias awa
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to make a member &apos;s statement about a special occasion .
since this is probably our last day , i want to inform you that my father is going to retire this winter .
he has been working for the hamlet council , i don &apos;t know for how long , i don &apos;t even remember when he first started work .
i know some of my colleagues remember when he started working .
he is now 78 years old and he is retiring .
he has been a member since that entity was established and he has been visiting the other communities to talk about religion .
some of his children are in iqaluit , toronto , winnipeg , grise fiord .
all of his children are employed because of all the support he has given .
he doesn &apos;t boast about his children but it is evident that he is very proud of us silently , so therefore i stand today to say how proud i am of my father .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
when we were members of the gnwt legislative assembly , somebody stated that we should recognize and acknowledge our elders while they are still alive .
that &apos;s what mr. evaluardjuk said and we are proud of you for making that member &apos;s statement and we appreciate the fact that you acknowledge your father &apos;s retirement .

item 4 :
returns to oral questions
return 08 -1 ( 3 ) :
question 7 - 1 ( 3 ) annual cost of caribou harvest in coral harbour
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
first of all i would like to apologize that my responses are not translated into inuktitut , but the inuktitut translation will be given to the members within 24 hours .
mr. speaker i would like to respond to a question that was posed on november 2 , by the member from qamanittuaq on the annual cost of the caribou harvest in coral harbour .
the department provides an annual subsidy of 75 thousand dollars to the coral harbour hunter &apos;s and trapper &apos;s organization for this hunt .
the return on this investment is very good .
the community has harvested about 2800 animals per year in the last six years .
total revenue for this period was 2 million 53 thousand 947 .
the annual harvest provides part time work for between 35 to 40 people for a two month period .
in dollar terms it has provided 1 million 137 thousand 877 in wages to the community .
purchases from local businesses during this period were 359 thousand 441 .
this is the first year that the federally inspected meat has been purchased by the keewatin fish &amp; meat ltd , and this has created 14 new full time positions in rankin inlet .
the regional offices of sustainable development are working closely with the community of coral harbour on this year &apos;s harvest .
the community is hoping to harvest 3500 animals this year .
thank you , mr. speaker .

mr. mclean .
item 6 :
oral questions
question 131 - 1 ( 3 ) :
asbestos in baker lake school
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na uqaqti .
mr. speaker i rise today to talk about an issue that has been long standing in the community of baker lake .
when all the members were in the community they had a tour of the jonah amitnak school .
i refer to a document in a technical status report that was completed in october of 1996 .
lo and behold on page 48 of the document there was an article 90 on page 48 ;
the insulation on the heating pipes in the 1957 section , which happens to be the oldest school in nunavut if not in the nwt , appears to have asbestos content .
this was in 1996 mr. speaker .
we finally get somebody to do a check on what the suspicious insulation was and lo and behold , it was discovered to be serpentine asbestos .
mr. speaker , when we hear the word asbestos we often fear the worst in the damage it can do to people .
in the last three years we have known that there has been a suspect item in that school .
and , through no initiative of public works , did they go to look at this substance .
so , we found somebody to look at it and that is what they came back with .
i know that there are schools that have asbestos in them but it seems to be a hushed up subject in nunavut .
mr. speaker , i want to ask the minister of education , does he have any plans to deal with asbestos in the baker lake school .
ma &apos;na .
speaker :
ma &apos;na mr. mclean .
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you , mr. speaker .
we asked them to look into that amongst other things and there is to be repair work being done on that .
however , we have the same concerns about the safety issues for the students and we are expecting a more detailed report and from those recommendations we will deal with it , definitely .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
oral questions , mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na uqaqti .
i appreciate the minister &apos;s response on it and i know it has been an issue that was brought over from the government of the nwt into the nunavut government .
like we have all been saying we are going to be closer to it and deal with these situations quicker .
the same people are in rankin inlet that knew about this issue and they don &apos;t seem to be moving forward .
i know the minister is not responsible for public works but i am responsible for the people in baker lake and he is responsible for all the people in education .
ma &apos;na .
speaker :
ma &apos;na mr. mclean .
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
yes , mr. speaker .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
oral questions .
mr. iqaqrialu .
question 132 - 1 ( 3 ) :
dewline cleanup
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i was going to ask the minister of community government and transportation , however i will go ahead and express my comments with respect to the dew line clean up .
there is one site near my community and it has been a long time with no clean up for this site .
it is an old site and we are starting to see more contaminants from the erosion that is taking place on this site .
also , the one in our community , the area of contamination is increasing in the damage that it is causing the environment .
i would like to see some consideration of what initiatives we can take on .
that is my question , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. iqaqrialu .
we have two questions .
mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
in regards to the question and the cleaning up of dew line sites .
the department of sustainable development when they are informed about contaminants on the ground , usually our staff works on it and assess the complaints .
when we are contacted we can ask to have the contaminants cleaned up .
i will take your question as notice as to whether we have analyzed it or not .
so i will review your question and take it as notice .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kilabuk .
mr. iqaqrialu your question is taken as notice by the minister .
oral questions .
mr. mclean .
question 133 - 1 ( 3 ) :
inuit teachers in secondary classes
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na uqaqti .
we already know that we have a large inuit teacher work force in the primary grades .
they have lots of experience , most of them are probably the longest serving civil servants in nunavut today .
has the minister considered trying to elevate these people from the primary classes up and give them more training so they can teach in the secondary classes .
thank you .
speaker :
ma &apos;na mr. mclean .
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you , mr. speaker .
yes , we have launched an initiative to start high school programs for our ntep students .
those teachers already teaching in the classes who want to upgrade their teaching levels to high school have that freedom and option to take further training as high school teachers .
that is part of our education for teachers initiative .
yes , they will have that option .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
oral question , mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you , mr. speaker .
on the same question .
can the minister explain to me , in very brief detail , what the initiative is right now . thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you , mr. speaker .
unlike my friend , i can be very brief .
&gt; &gt; laughter
these are all part of the areas where any teacher who wants to upgrade must identify .
with that identification we will have the numbers and work with the university and arctic college together to have these programs planned .
but the funding for it has already been approved and we will proceed .
speaker :
thank you mr. arvaluk , third supplementary mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i am very glad and happy to hear that mr. minister .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you , mr. speaker .
so those are separate , and it must be appreciated that they must qualify to teach materials or curriculum that they have been hired to teach .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
oral questions .
mr. puqiqnak .
question 134 - 1 ( 3 ) :
trades training in arctic college
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is directed to the minister of education .
i was wondering if arctic college has those kinds of training programs .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
minster responsible for education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
for example , we do have training programs in fort smith for those types of subjects .
we are talking about holding those types of training programs within nunavut .
yes , they go through the arctic college and the communities .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i thank the minister for his response , because in our communities we know and feel that there should be career training programs in the communities of nunavut .
we should have training programs for relevant things .
for that reason i thank him for the response , i know those kinds of training programs are outside of nunavut and we should have those types of programs in nunavut .
they know how to work as mechanics and so on and they want to train people .
nunavut residents want to train their people now . therefore i urge the minister and his department to initiate these types of training programs in nunavut .
also i would like to tell him that even when the session is not sitting he can approach me and discuss this .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
although i did not hear a question mr. puqiqnak , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i did not hear a question either .
when he speaks inuktitut i understand what his point was .
for those people who have been training on the job in the trades areas , we are proud of those people who have worked through these things , there are two tests done .
in regards to mechanics if they wanted to test in this area , they do it on paper and also in physical , actual work .
i am using a mechanic as an example because they have to change engines annually .
if there was a unilingual inuk who did not get official mechanical training , that person would still know what to do if they had been working in this trade .
i know that if this person looks at this testing , he would know right away , but if they were unilingual they would have to be taught a week or two .
for example the engines change annually and he would have to be brought up to date .
but for welding , plumbing or carpentry , which don &apos;t change annually it would be different .
but i would like to work with him and discuss these issues as to how we can recognize these kinds of people who do not have official schooling .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
oral questions , mr. iqaqrialu .
question 135 - 1 ( 3 ) :
university for nunavut
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i have another question to the minister of education .
last june during the session i asked a question in regards to a university .
we require a university in nunavut , so i was wondering if that is a possibility for our territory , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
yes , we have been working on the planning stages for quite some time but it won &apos;t be called the university of nunavut .
we thought about calling it arctic university .
there are quite a few things not done yet and we have to work on this university which may be open for the circumpolar communities , not just for nunavut .
we would have students from the various countries such as alaska , greenland and the other circumpolar countries .
the inuit circumpolar conference has been discussing this matter for quite some time and the governments in the different jurisdictions are now working on an agreement .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
oral questions , mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :

mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , that effects every single person living in nunavut .
mr. speaker , we always talk about wanting to be treated on the same level with the rest of canada .
mr. speaker i know that in any other jurisdiction in the south if ratepayers were hit with an increase like that there would be a huge public outcry .
mr. speaker , i would like to ask this government who and how and when will the government be addressing the concerns over this outrageous hike in postage rates .

final supplementary mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
thank you premier .
i am wondering if in your discussions , i also understood yesterday that the representative from canada post that was the spokesperson would be looking at the same increase next year .
i understand that with this increase this year it will be over 50 % in the past two years .
to me that is totally unacceptable .
where are they getting the surplus from , they are getting it from us .
i would like to ask the premier if he would convey those types of comments to whoever it is they are going to be lobbying at the federal level .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :

mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik :

question 138 - 1 ( 3 ) :
health board deficits
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question today is directed to the minister responsible for health and social services .
mr. speaker we have heard in the recent weeks and months of the financial crunch that the minister &apos;s department is in .
a good portion of this relates to deficits in the health boards .
my question to the minister is what plan or scheme does he have in mind to deal with this issue and also what impact are these deficits having on the delivery of health care .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
two question , minister responsible for health , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
first of all , in regards to the deficit , i am not pleased with the deficit myself , honestly .
coming into nunavut on april 1st , as has been related publicly , the health boards had an accumulated deficit of 8.9 million dollars .
we became aware of that shortly after we came into power , and it has gone through analysis in the department .

task force on housing consultation with the smaller communities
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na uqaqti .
the minister that i wanted to ask this question to is out of the house , but i still have to ask the question , so maybe somebody else can reply to it .
mr. speaker , over the last couple of months we have all been discussing the serious lack of housing in nunavut .
social housing , elders housing and staff housing .
we know there is a task force of regular mla &apos;s plus some government and private people addressing the situation .
mr. speaker my question to the minister is , will the minister commit that when this task force is addressing the needs of nunavut , that they will consult with the smaller communities .
will the minister commit to doing community consultations on the task force with these smaller communities .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
i would like to caution the members and ask them not to mention that the ministers are not here .
ministers do have other responsibilities throughout nunavut , so if you are going to ask a question please do not say the minister is not here , that is against our rules .

two questions .
minister responsible for health , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , first of all we should clarify that escorts are not used only for patients going to the south , they are also used to escort people here in nunavut .
in most cases mr. speaker , where the person may be a teenager or a younger person and there would be travelling outside their home community for medical travel an escort is provided .
mr. speaker , if we have an elderly person or a unilingual person who has to travel outside their home community for medical travel an escort is provided .

mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :

minister responsible for health , mr. picco .

minister responsible for sustainable development , mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :

just to elaborate further , right now they &apos;re working on the procedure .
before they closed the mine , right now when they reopen it , the number of staff will be 80 less than previously .

mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
in pond inlet , we have an elder who recently died .
he said that if you cannot build a snow house by yourself , you are not fit to have a spouse .
so that is what i was asking the premier because it falls along with his responsibilities because we have to utilize the request and the needs of the elders .
i know my question may sound a bit senseless .
i wanted to ask the question of whether he is capable of building a snow house .
i know it doesn &apos;t really sound sensible .

i am pleased to table a report on culture , education and health for 1999 / 2000 .
six month departmental progress updates .
standing committee on culture , education and health , report on six month departmental progress update .
introduction
in may of 1999 , the standing committees of the legislative assembly of nunavut recommended in the house that government of nunavut departments provide mid-year progress updates to the committees for review .
ministers and senior departmental officials appeared before the standing committees from october 14-16 , 1999 .
this exercise took place shortly before the opening of the third session of the legislative assembly , and the tabling of the bathurst mandate .
at the mid-point of the 1999-2000 fiscal year , the standing committees were interested in gaining a picture of where the new government stood in terms of spending to date ;
legislative and policy plans and priorities for the remainder of the fiscal year ;
staffing progress ;
and other matters .
unfortunately , standing committees were again disappointed by the fact that departments were inconsistent in the manner in which materials were provided to committee members .
while some departments provided thorough documentation , others did not .
few departments seemed able or willing to provide materials in advance of ministerial presentations .
problems with providing even short documents in both inuktitut and english were evident in some presentations .
the standing committee again recommends that departmental materials be provided to members in sufficient advance of appearances to allow for adequate preparation ;
and that all materials be fully translated .
mr. speaker , our report will be read by the other members of the legislative assembly .
mr. puqiqnak will be reading the report after me .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
reports of standing and special committees .
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i will be reading the standing committee on culture , education and health report .
department of culture , language , elders and youth
the honourable donald havioyak , minister of culture , language , elders and youth appeared before the standing committee on october 14 , 1999 .
mid-year fiscal position
the standing committee was disappointed that no documents detailing the mid-year financial status of the department were provided .
new organizational chart
the standing committee noted recent changes in several of the key staff positions during the summer , but also observed that a lot had been accomplished in the last few months .
the committee is concerned that the department is only 25 % staffed , with 12 positions trying to accomplish a very broad mandate .
the committee is pleased to hear that a new senior finance person assisted in the development of the new organizational chart , which was being presented to cabinet for final approval .
in terms of decentralization , the minister advised that part of the language division was being moved from cambridge bay to kugluktuk .
the minister advised that staff in cambridge bay had been given notice of relocation and that the 9 positions allocated to kugluktuk now have housing and office space available to them .
the standing committee encourages the department to fill its outstanding positions as quickly as possible .
preservation , revitalization and provision of inuktitut / inuinnaqtun language
in its may report , the standing committee had urged the creation of language policies to outline how language services are to be accessed , as well as other matters .
the standing committee is concerned that no update was provided and observed that difficulties seem to be encountered in providing effective and timely translation services from igloolik .
the standing committee is sympathetic and understands that more interpreter / translators will be put into place .
however , it points to the need for required timelines for other departments to provide original material to be translated , which would be part of a language policy .
this policy should reinforce the needs of the standing committees to ultimately receive materials well in advance of the hearing dates , as discussed above .
the standing committee reiterates its recommendations at page 20 in its may 1999 report :
however , the committee continues to push for inuktitut language training programs to be taught by elders to our youth .
official languages agreement the standing committee was concerned that this intergovernmental agreement had not yet been signed with the federal government for this fiscal year .
the deputy minister noted that the problem was the share allocated to nunavut , $ 2.8m , is not sufficient to meet our needs in both french and aboriginal languages .
nevertheless , it appears that the government of nunavut will sign the current agreement without changes and try to negotiate for changes for the coming year in the winter .
the standing committee would like to receive more detail on this agreement and its scope .
the standing committee is concerned at the lack of sufficient funding for translation and interpretation .
the standing committee recommends that sufficient funding be secured to translate all nunavut legislation into inuktitut and inuinnaqtun .
nunavut territorial archives and heritage
the committee looks forward to hearing more about the repatriation of historical artifacts to nunavut from other parts of canada and the world .
the standing committee was also pleased to hear that the department was moving forward with plans for a heritage centre and an archival facility .
however , the members have some concern about a heritage facility being located in igloolik , which might not be accessible to very many residents or visitors .
the standing committee would like to receive more detail on the proposed heritage centre and archival facility and reiterates its recommendation at page 21 of its may 1999 report :
nunavut arts council
the standing committee noted that there were recent newspaper advertisements inviting public consultation regarding the nunavut arts council .
members expressed their desire to receive copies of the consultation documents .
the standing committee recommends that the nunavut arts council provide one-stop funding information for all funding available to nunavut artists , musicians and cultural workers .
inuit qaujimajatuqangit
the standing committee looks forward to receiving a copy at the end of this month of the report and the recommendations that emerged from the workshop .
inuit place names
the standing committee recommends that the department work in co-ordination with inuit organizations to provide funding and support to communities to assist them in inuit place names projects .
elders
members are concerned that efforts be undertaken as soon as possible to obtain the legends and songs from the elders .
as well , members continue to wish for programs that will allow elders to be able to teach the youth about the language and the culture of the inuit and the traditions .
the minister committed to ensuring that there will be easy to access forms in inuktitut and inuinnaqtun and the deputy minister stated that staff will help elders fill out any application forms for funding .
however , it was not clear if in fact , there is funding for this purpose .
the standing committee strongly reiterates its recommendations at pages 6 and 22 of the may 1999 report .
youth
the standing committee was pleased to hear that the senior advisor for youth began in august and is consulting with regional youth conferences to set priorities for youth in nunavut .
as well , the minister noted that a canada wide youth conference will be held in iqaluit in january 2000 .
the standing committee looks forward to hearing the results of these meetings and the department &apos;s plans for youth .
women &apos;s issues / status of women &apos;s council
the standing committee is very supportive of the creation of a women &apos;s council , which will be truly representative and accountable to the women of nunavut .
members note that women in the communities of nunavut would be more empowered if they were to select their own representatives to this body .
persons with disabilities

members noted again their own observations that local people need to learn practical skills that are needed often in their communities , such as construction and drywall taping .
the standing committee looks forward to receiving updates on this research .
strategic issues in education
the standing committee received a briefing of some of the critical issues that the department is facing in trying to develop a more relevant education system for nunavut .
the effort by the department to understand the impacts of these issues and to analyze trends is appreciated .
the standing committee commends the thorough approach being undertaken by this department .
capital plan
the standing committee was advised that the 20-year capital plan has been initiated .
members asked about the total capital projects projected in the business plan and the proportion applied for capital projects currently underway , legal requirements and health , safety and statutory obligations .
members were advised that effectively , the capital plan currently in place was the 5-year capital plan inherited from the gnwt and it is being reviewed annually in nunavut .
these matters should have come to the standing committee as part of the capital plan .
the government has stated that all of the communities should be treated equitably , but there appears to be special treatment here .
the standing committee looks forward to a full discussion of the department &apos;s capital projects in the upcoming capital plan consultations for the government of nunavut .
other education initiatives
members were pleased to see that there would be 76 scholarships of $ 3,000 each , which will be prioritized based on need .
members were concerned whether this will be enough funds to meet the needs of all of the students wishing to further their education .
the standing committee is interested in receiving more information on the criteria for these scholarships and departmental estimates of the number of students in need of financial support .
children with special needs
members continue to have concerns about special needs students and the lack of strategies or plans for persons with disabilities , including physical , mental and learning disabilities .
members observed that children with disabilities do not have a voice - they cannot make proposals or requests .
members want these children to have the tools to give them as much opportunity as possible for a good future .
members would like to see a school for students with disabilities , so that they don &apos;t have to leave nunavut to go to schools that will meet their needs .
members were advised that the department is reviewing this matter and surveying students with disabilities being trained in other provinces .
the standing committee looks forward to receiving an update on the planning process for students with disabilities and strongly encourages the department to address the gaps in this area .
housing for teachers
members expressed concern about the lack of housing for teachers in many of the communities .
the minister noted that at present , the issue of housing for teachers is in the jurisdiction of the district education councils .
the government of nunavut should also look at putting aside some staff housing for teachers .
in those communities where affordability is an issue , the committee recommends that the department look at whether giving teachers a larger subsidy would help .
income security
department of health and social services
minister picco appeared before the standing committee on october 14 , 1999 .
mid-year fiscal position - the deficits of the health boards
the standing committee was pleased to receive documents detailing the mid-year financial status of the department .
however , the detail was focused primarily on the deficit of the health boards and the projected deficit for the department .
the briefing highlighted the fact that health and social services in nunavut receives less proportionate funding of the total budget than in any other provincial or territorial government .
this , despite the fact that additional costs of providing health and social services in nunavut are even more expensive than elsewhere in canada , due to patient travel and care providers .
these factors have contributed to the deficit of the regional health boards .
nevertheless , the question remains of how to pay for the deficits .
the deficits of the previous fiscal year must be absorbed by the entire government of nunavut , as determined under the assets and liabilities agreement with the gnwt .
the standing committee supports the overall goal of applying any surplus towards new housing stock , as a goal which will positively affect the health of nunavummiut .
as to the current fiscal year , the regional health boards and the department must be encouraged to take more responsibility now , so that their deficit situation is minimised .
departmental finance staff should work closely with the regional health boards and their executive directors to ensure a sincere effort to keep within budget .
the minister acknowledged that one area where the costs for health care are driven upwards is through the use of temporary nursing contracts .
these are expensive contracts paid on an hourly rate to agencies , in addition to all transportation and accommodation costs .
in addition , temporary nurses often increase the amount of medical travel , as they tend to refer patients to the larger facilities .
the minister spoke of new retention initiatives being undertaken by the department and focus-group discussions which will be taking place in several communities .
nevertheless , the difficulties in recruiting new nurses were underlined by the fact that the department recently had to go as far as australia to recruit nine new nurses for nunavut .
the standing committee supports the retention initiatives currently being undertaken and further requests detailed information on the costs associated with temporary nursing positions .
a new direction for the department - promotion of health and prevention of illness
the department provided detailed information on health status indicators and critical issues that must be overcome if we are to achieve healthy communities in nunavut .
the standing committee encourages this direction .
nevertheless , the committee is concerned that the approach envisioned seems to be one of hiring more professionals from the south , rather than one of community empowerment .
for example , the goal for the department at the community level is 1 community health nurse for every 200 people and 1 social worker for every 300 people .
there are many models of care delivery that involve the public more and the standing committee does not believe that enough effort has been given to them in the past in nunavut .
members noted that if there was consistent staff support for a community health committee , members of the committee could go on local radio and participate in health promotion activities .
historically , inuit had to provide many of these services for each other and we need to reinvigorate this knowledge and experience .
mental health
members observe that mental health workers coming from the south are not as aware of the needs of the community as they should be .
members also observed that there is heavy reliance on drugs prescribed by visiting doctors or to patients who have been sent out of the community .
this does not always work , as there is not always support for follow-up in the community .
members want to see mental health workers incorporating both inuit qaujimajatuqangit , and a good knowledge of inuit language and culture , with a specialized knowledge of mental health skills .
members feel that there are people in their communities who are capable of learning mental health skills and delivering these services .
members also feel the need for both male and female mental health workers in their communities .
at the same time , members recognize that a holistic approach should include both physical and mental health .
the standing committee recommends that the department take a new approach to mental health , which integrates inuit qaujimajatuqangit and more community involvement in the delivery of mental health programs .
community wellness
the standing committee was advised that the department is trying to take a lead role in co-ordinating the various funding initiatives from several departments that fall under the broad heading of &quot; wellness &quot; .
in some communities , wellness co-ordinators work for the hamlets and in the baffin , they are part of the regional inuit association .
members were advised that the community wellness co-ordinators will play a role in the community level health decision-making . the standing committee is encouraged by this development .
members were also advised that the community health representatives ( chrs ) will also play a role in the community level health decision making , along with the nurses and social workers .
members observe that at times , chrs become secretaries , interpreters , liaison , and have very little time to do health promotion or prevention work .
members would like to see the role of the chr clarified and they note that if the chrs were under the hamlet councils , they could promote wellness in the community better .
members note that both the community wellness co-ordinator and the chr &apos;s could provide support to the community health committees .
the standing committee recommends the development of co-ordinated , community-based decision making , in conjunction with the community health committees and looks forward to receiving more information on this model .
dissolution of the regional health boards
the standing committee was pleased to hear that consultants have met with the people in keewatin , baffin and the kitikmeot and that an implementation co-ordinator is in place .
while no timetable was presented , it appears that the planning is continuing on schedule to unify the administrative structure with the participation and involvement of the regional health boards .
as well , the department is consulting with the 26 communities in nunavut .
members were advised the community health committees , such as the one in kimmirut , are the model for focusing community concern .
if one is not in place , then the department is looking at a process of talking to the mayors to see if a health subcommittee could be established under the local elected hamlet .
the standing committee recommends that some of the authority and power of the health boards be given to the community health committees , especially in the area of health promotion .
it is crucial that staff support be given so that the community health committees can be effective .
the standing committee looks forward to receiving detailed information of how the communities will be more involved in health and social service matters .
telehealth
members attended a telehealth demonstration and are aware of some of the possibilities for long distance delivery in nunavut . members note that telehealth is very expensive .
the standing committee recommends that the department conduct an evaluation of this technology in the pilot communities and they look forward to receiving further information on the telehealth projects .
nunavut nursing program
the standing committee was very pleased to see the nunavut nursing program up and running in september in iqaluit .
the committee earnestly hopes the program succeeds and is a model for training other health care providers in nunavut .
the standing committee recommends that the department and the college put extra effort into ensuring that the students successfully complete the program and looks forward to receiving updates on the program .
capital plan
the minister advised that a departmental capital plan had been initiated , to deal with the needs for renovation of existing facilities and the need for new ones .
the minister advised that a consultant has been hired to do a program operational review of the p3 projects , which will do a cost analysis .
this will be presented to cabinet .
the standing committee recommends that any p3 financed projects be reviewed by members in the same manner as any other capital projects , prior to their final approval .
standing committee on community empowerment and sustainable development - report on the 1999 / 2000 six month departmental progress update
introduction
in may of 1999 , the standing committees of the legislative assembly of nunavut recommended in the house that government of nunavut departments provide mid-year progress updates to the committees for review .
ministers and senior departmental officials appeared before the standing committees from october 14-16 , 1999 .
this exercise took place shortly before the opening of the third session of the legislative assembly , and the tabling of the bathurst mandate .
at the mid-point of the 1999-2000 fiscal year , the standing committees were interested in gaining a picture of where the new government stood in terms of spending to date ;
legislative and policy plans and priorities for the remainder of the fiscal year ;
staffing progress ;
and other matters .
unfortunately , standing committees were again disappointed by the fact that departments were inconsistent in the manner in which materials were provided to committee members .
while some departments provided thorough documentation , others did not .
few departments seemed able or willing to provide materials much in advance of ministerial presentations .
problems with providing even short documents in both inuktitut and english were evident in some presentations .
the standing committee again recommends that departmental materials be provided to members in sufficient advance of appearances to allow for adequate preparation ;
and that all materials be fully translated .
generally speaking , the standing committee on community empowerment and sustainable development was satisfied with the progress to date made by the four departments under its oversight mandate .
this report will serve to highlight the standing committee &apos;s main observations and concerns .
department of justice
minister anawak appeared before the committee on october 15 , 1999 .
legislative drafting
the committee strongly supports efforts by the department to ensure that full inuktitut and innuinaqtun translations of all bills are prepared .
the committee recommends that this initiative be extended to other core justice materials , such as the nunavut gazette .
cross-cultural sensitivity training for rcmp and corrections staff
members of the committee were pleased to learn of the recent successful graduation of several inuit rcmp cadets .
the committee is of the view that that there is a need for better cross-cultural training to be provided to non-inuit members of the rcmp and corrections staff .
the committee is also of the view that the department has an important role to play in working with federal counterparts in this regard .
the committee recommends that the department follow up on this issue .
departmental spending to date
the minister indicated that he anticipated that the department would conclude the fiscal year with a surplus , although no specific figures were provided .
the surplus is primarily a result of not all positions being staffed .
corrections planning committee
the minister indicated that the report of the cpc would be submitted to the minister shortly .
the standing committee looks forward to receiving a copy of the report .
the committee is of the view that corrections is an area in which inuit qaujimajatuqangit can be of great help in program design and delivery .
members of the committee also expressed concern over the issue of youth incarceration , and encourage the minister to pursue solutions that work to support healthy families .
the committee reiterates its support for the use of on-the-land camps .
community justice committees
the minister indicated that officials will be working with the crown , the rcmp and cjcs on a diversion policy .
the standing committee reiterates its support for movement in this area .
the committee also recommends that the department work to ensure that cjcs in all regions have a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities .
law review commission ( maligarnit qimirrujiit )
the minister indicated that departmental staff will be assigned to support the work of the commission .
community government and transportation
minister anawak appeared before the committee on october 15 , 1999 .
airport capital assistance program
the minister indicated that discussions between the department and the federal government were progressing well .
the standing committee is supportive of the minister &apos;s efforts in this area .
safety standards and emergency response
the minister indicated that departmental officials were working to ensure equitable safety standards and emergency services would apply across nunavut .
the standing committee is supportive of this policy direction .
search and rescue
members of the committee indicated to the minister that situations continue to arise on the land and at outpost camps in which confusion between the responsibilities of sar and medevac are evident .
the standing committee recommends that the departments of cgt and hss work to resolve the issue ;
and that adequate funding be provided for sar operations .
community empowerment
the minister indicated that the department plans to hold consultations with mayors and the nunavut association of municipalities to discuss such issues as block funding and transfer of responsibilities .
members of the committee recommend that transfer of responsibilities to communities be accompanied by adequate resources .
minister thompson appeared before the committee on october 15 , 1999 .
housing
the minister advised the standing committee that hiring is in progress for a new president of the housing corporation .
the minister also indicated that the work of the minister &apos;s task force on housing would commence shortly .
two members of the standing committee serve on the task force .
in keeping with the bathurst mandate &apos;s commitment to making housing one of the government of nunavut &apos;s two primary commitments ;
and while recognizing and supporting the potential for the minister &apos;s task force to make a valuable contribution to housing policy reform ;
review of contracting regulations and the nunavut business incentive policy
the minister indicated that a departmental working group is in the process of conducting a review these issues , in consultation with nti .
and to continue to push to ensure that the government deals with these issues in a spirit of genuine commitment to article 24 , and the principles of transparency and fairness .
internet access for small communities
the standing committee was pleased to learn of progress being made in connecting nunavut communities to the internet . the committee recommends that smaller communities not be ignored in this respect .
members of the committee expressed their desire for the department to better use local knowledge and nunavut-appropriate designs and technologies in construction and other projects .
members take note that the department has recently called for expressions of interest for public housing design concepts .
department of sustainable development
minister kilabuk appeared before the committee on october 16 .
mining sector
the minister outlined some recent departmental initiatives , including the signing of a geoscience accord with the federal government , and the prospectors &apos; program .
the committee recommends that the department place strong emphasis in its planning to be prepared for significant increases in mining activity over the next few years in nunavut ;
and that efforts be made , in conjunction with relevant stakeholders , to provide training programs for residents of the territory to secure employment in this sector .
&quot; one window &quot; approach
the minister indicated that the department is continuing to work towards a &quot; one window &quot; approach for support to small business .
the committee further recommends that greater emphasis on effective follow-up support and advice for funding recipients be made .
relations with other jurisdictions
the committee reiterates its support for the minister &apos;s efforts to secure a fair deal for nunavut in such areas as fishing quotas ;
and for the minister &apos;s efforts to negotiate an mou on economic development with the government of canada .
arts and crafts sector
members of the standing committee recommend that the department continue to pursue innovative ways of supporting the arts and crafts sector ;
including support to carving associations and ways to ensure the ready availability of carving materials in communities .

what kind of artists will the nunavut arts council consist of .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. puqiqnak would you like to respond .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
mr. chairman , the nunavut arts council , they are called naca , nunavut arts council association , and we also considered the fact that the artists do get funding from the federal government .
we do have heritage funds in ottawa and every spring usually the carvers have a festival in inuvik .
we were wondering if we could have similar programs in nunavut and have our own nunavut arts council association .
this entity would be able to provide one stop funding , as we do have funding sources from the federal government .
the ottawa inuit art foundation supplies some funding to nunavut when they ask for it and they bring inuit people down there to carve .
if we have our own nunavut arts council we can generate more income in nunavut .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
perhaps just in addition to that i would like to see some sort of document outlining this issue .
i apologize , all of the details are in the standing committee reports , we are just reading the recommendations right now .
so if you read all of the standing committee reports you would have had a more clear understanding .

good afternoon members of the legislative assembly , invited guests , ladies and gentlemen .
( interpretation ends ) we are resuming the third session of the first legislative assembly of nunavut .
today is an historic day .
it is the first sitting of the legislative assembly to take place outside of iqaluit .
on behalf of all the members of the house i would like to extend our warmest thanks to the people of rankin inlet for the gracious welcome that you have extended to us .
( interpretation ) also i would like to recognize the people who worked very hard to put this together so that we would be fully prepared for our sitting .
i would like to recognize the youth who worked hard to get us going .
( interpretation ends ) i would like to thank the students and teachers of maani ulujuk school for allowing us the use of your school .
special recognition is due to lizzie ittinuar , our sergeant at arms for this week .
in carrying the mace , the traditional symbol of legislative authority , lizzie also embodies the strength of our elders and our heritage .
we have been looking forward to sitting here for some months now and it is a testament to the spirit of this community to see the chamber so full today .
( interpretation ) today before we go to the orders of the day , i would like to read the remarks sent to us by the commissioner of nunavut .
it says ;
&quot; mr. speaker i wish to advise that i recommend to the legislative assembly of nunavut the passage of the following bills ;
loan authorization act 2000 / 2001 and the supplementary appropriations act , no. 2 , 1999 / 2000 .

i would like to let everyone in the house know that we have the channels up on the wall . you have inuktitut , english , inuinnaqtun and they are on different channels .
you can also hear the floor .
please refer to the notices on the side of the wall .
mr. premier .
item 2 :
ministers &apos; statements
minister &apos;s statement 41 - 1 ( 3 ) decentralization update
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
first of all before i start i would like to thank you all , to the people that are here in the house .
i am very glad to see that there are a lot of people here interested in seeing the sittings .
thank you .
mr. speaker , i wish to inform members and bring them up to date on decentralization activities , and progress towards our commitment to relocate government operations and employees to various communities throughout nunavut .
( interpretation ends ) decentralization continues to be a priority for those who planned and designed this government , a priority of all mlas elected to this assembly .
the decentralization secretariat was formally established under the department of the executive &amp; intergovernmental affairs in september , 1999 .
leona aglukkaq was appointed as the assistant deputy minister for the decentralization section of our department .
( interpretation ends ) mr. speaker , as i have mentioned in the past , the implementation of decentralization is an important step in the development of nunavut .
but it is equally important that decentralization is implemented in the most efficient and cost effective manner possible .
a planned approach will not only ensure programs and services are not interrupted during departmental relocation , but will maximize future benefits for nunavummiut .
therefore the decentralisation secretariat has taken a detailed approach to planning .
this has involved reviewing any critical shortage in housing and office space , determining requirements for furnishings and systems , planning for training and preparation for new recruitment .
the planning is ongoing and circumstances are continuing to change .
advanced planning and costing is part of the larger objective of ensuring decentralization occurs without waste .
the government of nunavut is committed to efficiency in government and this applies to decentralization .
the decentralization secretariat is committed to analyzing costs and trying to minimize these costs wherever possible .
the decentralization secretariat is also committed to supporting the departments that will be relocated and in this process of assisting each department , will develop customised plans to assist in their moves .
these plans will look at all the logistics involved , ensuring there is minimal disruption to programs and services during the implementation phase .
( interpretation ends ) while the success of decentralization depends on having trained
personnel available in these communities it is also true that local training will be more effective with the local community presence of government departments .
this means that individuals will not have to leave their community to participate in public service training opportunities .
the training that is provided to these individuals will not only lead to government employment but will make many other opportunities available to them .
once trained they may wish to be employed outside of the government and even outside their community .
( interpretation ) mr. speaker i am pleased to inform the members that a portion of this year &apos;s decentralization budget has been targeted at local training initiatives .
this shows our commitment , not only to making decentralization happen , but to maximize its benefits .
mr. speaker it is indicative of our commitment to decentralization that a specific budget allocation required to implement decentralization in the coming fiscal year has been recommended for approval .
this budget will be sufficient to implement about one third of our overall decentralization objective .
mr. speaker decentralization is a key objective of our government and one that this government will ensure happens as planned within three years .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier , mr. okalik .
ministers &apos; statements . mr. premier .
minister &apos;s statement 42 - 1 ( 3 ) visual identity program
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
earlier today i was pleased to unveil the new logo for the government of nunavut .
this logo will be used to identify the government in our territory , across canada and throughout the world .
( interpretation ends ) it is difficult to choose just one symbol to represent a land and people as diverse as nunavut .
this symbol represents the unity of our territory .
it reflects the pride in the traditions of nunavut and these traditions are a foundation for our government as it moves forward to improve the lives of nunavummiut .
( interpretation ) the artists who developed our logo , andrew qappik and dan o &apos;brien spoke with many people about what they would like to see in our logo .
mr. speaker , some people in this room contributed to that discussion .
the north star is also included in the designs of the nunavut flag and coat of arms .
( interpretation ends ) mr. speaker the pages are delivering to each member a souvenir of the occasion .
i hope you will all enjoy this gift .
( interpretation ) i also want to take this opportunity to thank andrew and dan for their hard work and creativity .
there will be a feast tonight to celebrate our new logo and honour our artists .
i encourage everyone to participate in this celebration .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. okalik .
ministers &apos; statements .
mr. kilabuk .
minister &apos;s statement 43 - 1 ( 3 ) program partnerships
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker when our new government was formed on april 1 , 1999 , we took steps to ensure programs delivered to the public would not be interrupted .
our first year of delivering these programs has given us an opportunity to see what programs are working and the effectiveness of our delivery .
it has also given us the opportunity to speak with members of this house and our program partners on where changes and improvements need to be made .
in fact when i appeared before the standing committee on community empowerment and sustainable development october 1999 , this topic was on their mind as well .
they asked me to examine approaches to program delivery that improve the accountability and transparency of their operations .
mr. speaker , the department of sustainable development delivers its programs through four levels of partnerships .
first , we work in partnership with hamlets in delivering community economic development services in communities .
second , we work in partnership with outside organizations who deliver other business programs such as partners in development in this region .
third , we work in partnership with industry associates such as nunavut tourism and the nunavut arts and crafts association .
finally we work in partnership with the government of canada such as through the canada / nunavut geoscience office .
mr speaker i would like to advise the house today that my department of sustainable development intends to introduce a new policy on our program partnerships on 2000 / 2001 .
this policy will provide a clear framework on how we intend to fund our partnerships , the terms under which we are partnering our programs and our expected performance and reporting standards .
i am pleased to say that we have now sent information on the new department of sustainable development to all mayors in nunavut .
we have also recently completed a simple program brochure which identifies which people to contact in communities and at the regional level about our program information .
i expect to report on progress on this early in the new fiscal year .
mr. speaker this government through the bathurst mandate made a commitment to simplify and enhance access to our programs .
the changes i have detailed today are the first phase of continued improvements to program delivery that you can expect from the department of sustainable development .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr kilabuk . ministers &apos; statements .
mr. arvaluk .
minister &apos;s statement 44 - 1 ( 3 ) integration of school services
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker . first of all , representing the mothers and fathers i would like to thank them for our students .
mr speaker i submitted a progress report on the dissolution of divisional education councils to the standing committee on education , culture and health in february of this year .
however , i think it is important for all members to be aware of what is happening with this project so i will provide you with a verbal update .
in addition , i would be pleased to share my written report to any interested member .
( interpretation ends ) the integration of school services with the department of education will bring our department closer to nunavummiut .
following a decision to dissolve the divisional education councils in the spring of 1999 , legislation was passed and work began in may to start the process of change .
the team doing the work consisted of staff from both headquarter and board offices .
we made a special effort to involve inuit staff in the decision making .
i briefed the nunavut social development council and we also had two meetings with the board chairs to inform them of the change and to brief them on progress .
i also met with each full divisional council at least once in the last 10 months .
it will be critical for us to set up an effectively functioning administrative operation in each region , reporting to an assistant deputy minister at headquarters .
the newly designed organizations will not look a lot different than the existing board operations .
however by july 1 , 2000 they will no longer be at arms length form the nunavut government .
they will use the government &apos;s central agency services and will conform to government policies in all areas .
( interpretation ends ) i am pleased to report that the new organization design is complete and all staff in board offices received job offers by early december .
they now understand their roles in the new organization .
we succeeded in fulfilling the governments promise that there would be no layoffs and this has really reduced anxiety levels amongst staff .
i am confident that we now have the resources in place to make the transition on time in july of this year .
the department predicted savings of 1 million dollars through the dissolution of the boards of management .
i am confident we will meet that target .
we have been able to achieve significant savings through the elimination of board per diems and travel costs .
we will also save money through staff reductions made possible through the use of central agency services .
these savings will be phased in over a number of months starting at the beginning of the 2000 / 2001 school year .
( interpretation ) mr. speaker we still have a lot work to do make this project a success .
however , we are a bit ahead of schedule and i have no doubt that this important change will proceed on time , within budget .
the dissolution of the divisional education councils and the integration of these services into the department will move the department of education and the minister of education closer to our students and all nunavummiut .
thank you mr. speaker

thank you , mr. speaker .
we are very happy and proud to be here .
at least now we have established the nunavut government and there are some things that we didn &apos;t expect that are happening today .
we see drum dancing in the legislative assembly , we see a qulliq being lit and the young children singing o &apos;canada in inuktitut .
these are all things that we should be proud of and that the elders are here too .
so on behalf of each and every one of them i would like to thank them and i would also like to acknowledge the pages for a week .
i would like to thank them , elaine bruce , alurak and codie dean , tupa ford , amie kuludjak , joanne kent and laura mary .
these are our pages for this week .
i would also like to acknowledge , as i have stated before we see things that we did not expect to see .
as the person who opened the meeting with a prayer said , this is the first time that the mace was carried by a woman into the legislature .
lizzie ittinuar , who is the sergeant at arms , i know that all of the nunavut residents recognize her , but she has worked very hard to maintain the traditional clothing .
i don &apos;t think we recognize her for all her work to enhance , keep and preserve traditional clothing .
i was very proud of her carrying the mace .
i would also like to welcome the members and we are very glad and proud to welcome you to rankin inlet .

hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
it has been not too many days since we lost our friend and family member , maurice kukkiak from chesterfield inlet .
he was a hunter and i know mr. speaker , elders would say that he died doing what he really enjoyed , not through sickness .
we send our sympathy and condolences to the family .
i have been saddened not since yesterday but previously when somebody dies who is so dear to us .
we saw him recently on tv and i was not too happy about that , i did not know if the tv company got approval from the family .
he went through aptn when the day is too close to his date of death .
so i am asking them to be aware of these things .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
perhaps we will write a letter on behalf of the members of the legislative assembly to the family members .

also , elders are now dying off and our young people are increasing in numbers .
our elders should teach our young people how to live a traditional way of life in the year 2000 , which i expect to see .

size of housing lots
hon. manitok thompson :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i have a number of returns to oral questions .
one question was asked by mr. iqaqrialu on november 3 , 1999 regarding the distance between houses .
the size of housing lots is normally determined as a result of hamlet zoning by-laws .
smaller hamlets use a &quot; land use planning &quot; process in lieu of specific zoning requirements .
another factor which dictates distances between houses is the fire separation regulations .

at the time of this response none of the product has been used and no complaints have been received .
also we have not received any complaints from the airlines in reference to the community of pelly bay either .
we have completed an analysis of the costs to provide certified aviation fuel in pelly bay which would include proper storage , piping and distribution facilities .
preliminary estimates are in the millions of dollars depending on the options chosen .

dew line clean up
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i would like to make a response to a question that was asked at the last session .
the question was brought up by mr. iqaqrialu regarding the dew line cleanup sites .
following the last session i sent a letter to member iqaqrialu , as well as all members of the legislative assembly which detailed the status of clean ups at all sites in nunavut .
mr. speaker , i would like to advise the house that environmental assessments have been completed for all 39 dew line sites .
indian and northern affairs canada and the department of national defence are both using restoration procedures that ensure that the level of clean up meets acceptable clean up standards and guidelines .
the department of national defence is committed to monitoring the landfill sites following clean up .
mr. speaker , my department &apos;s environmental protection services maintains close contact with officials in both the department of national defence and indian affairs .
they also review and provide input into proposals that are submitted by consultants chosen to carry out clean up activities at the dew line sites .
in my correspondence to members , i detailed the schedule and status of clean up operations at every dew line site and i am tabling this information in the house today .
i would like to assure mr. iqaqrialu that his concern surrounding the clean up of these sites is being closely monitored by my officials .

economic agreement with echo bay mines
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker , i left my mike on .
today i would like to make a reply to a question that was brought up by the member for iqaluit centre in regards to echo bay mines .
this information was also contained in a letter to mr. tootoo sent after the last session .
the kitikmeot inuit association is also working with echo bay to ensure that there are linkages made to the labour force and business community in the kitikmeot .
however , mr. speaker , there are no binding agreements requiring echo bay to employ residents of the northwest territories or nunavut .
on the question of whether employees at the lupin mine from outside nunavut will pay personal income tax in nunavut , this is determined by revenue canada on the basis of their principle residence .
therefore an employee at the lupin mine whose family and home are in alberta would pay income tax in alberta .

baker lake freezer
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
so that i don &apos;t have to keep standing up , i have four responses for returns to oral questions and i will cover them all .
one of them will be in english .
( interpretation ends ) the first was a question asked by mr. mclean on october 28 , 1999 .
the baker lake freezer was well maintained but has exceeded its life span and requires replacement .
since the community of baker lake has an empowerment agreement with community government &amp; transportation , there has been uncertainty about departmental responsibility for funding the replacement .
when the review has been completed , the responsible department will provide an update .
return to oq 93 - 1 ( 3 ) :
rankin inlet utilidor project
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
the next one is a return to an oral question that was brought up by mr. iqaqrialu regarding the rankin inlet utilidor project .
the budget for the project was 8.9 million , with the hamlet paying the larger share of the costs .
the correction of the elevation calculation error on the nuuvuk subdivision utilidor did not cause the project to go over budget .
there were no additional costs to the government of nunavut as a result of the error .
thank you .
return to oq 106 - 1 ( 3 ) :
length of runway overlay in qikiqtarjuaq
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
i have another return to an oral question regarding the length of a runway overlay for qikiqtarjuaq .
the project was intended to extend the runway to 3,939 feet .
during a geo-technical check , problems with soil conditions causing unstable ground were found after the 3,800 foot mark .
therefore the overlay was extended only to 3,800 feet from the existing 3,475 feet and the angle straightened to produce a standard taxiway shape .
thirty eight hundred feet is more than sufficient for air carriers such as the hawker sidley , which requires 3,500 feet for maximum loads .
thank you .
return to oq 107 - 1 ( 3 ) :
location of old dump site
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
a response to mr. nutarak &apos;s question on october 29 , 1999 .
if budget estimates are approved , another 180 thousand will be spent to complete the project in the upcoming year .
this should deal with the concern about unpleasant smells in the area .

question 148 - 1 ( 3 ) :
fuel price increase effects on hunters
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i have a question directed towards the department of public works .
mr. speaker , nti president paul quassa has released a report and he was interviewed and we were told that there were going to be fuel hikes .
we will be paying almost a million dollars because of the increase in the gas prices .
paul quassa also stated that the hunters have rights to go hunting , trapping and fishing within nunavut .
i would like to ask the minister if the ministers are as concerned as we are about the gas price hikes .
this gas price hike became effective on january 1 , and i would like to ask the ministers if they would work together with nunavut tunngavik in regards to the gas price hikes .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :

i had received a letter from the president of nti and i have responded to him about the price hike on fuel .
we just followed the world prices of fuel and the price of fuel has gone up in canada , and we have no choice but to follow it .
as the government we do pay a subsidy for fuel and it is a huge amount .

communication with mlas on fuel price increase

thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question is to the minister of public works &amp; housing .
however , it was on january 6th , 2000 that the minister sent a letter to mlas informing us of this price increase .
my question to the minister is , why weren &apos;t the regular mlas informed or told about this increase before it went into place .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :

question 150 - 1 ( 3 ) :
timing of fuel price increase
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question is on the same issue and it &apos;s to the minister responsible for petroleum products .
mr. speaker , the increase in the fuel by 6 cents came at a very unfortunate time of the year .
it was around christmas time and we were informed or learned that the price was going up by 6 cents .
it &apos;s like , to me merry christmas , happy new year , here &apos;s your christmas gift .
my concern is that the fuel that is presently in the tanks was purchased last year and has been there since last summer .
why is the price being increased now on fuel that was purchased last year .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister responsible for public works , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
we could have increased the price the day the fuel was delivered but we deferred the increase until now .
so the price was going to increase then but did not .

minister responsible for public works , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
yes , i apologize , we had to increase the fuel price when everybody was celebrating christmas .
i don &apos;t think we can expect prices to go down , but it was not 6 cents , it was 5 cents .
the increasing of the price was set for that date .
again , i apologize if we did not notify the members properly .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you ms. thompson .
second supplementary , mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
given the fact that the minister has stated that she was aware that the price was going to increase .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister responsible for public works , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
we usually increase the prices during the fall and it &apos;s evident as i have stated before we don &apos;t expect the prices of fuel to go down .
although we paid for that fuel at that price we have to follow the increases too , so that is just a normal procedure .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you ms. thompson .
final supplementary , mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
unfortunately that still didn &apos;t answer my question .
the minister is basically saying that the fuel that we purchased last year , if we purchased it for example at 30 dollars a barrel , there is an increase of another 10 dollars .
so we are paying an increase on fuel that we purchased last year at a lower price .
my question to the minister is what knowledge does she have , if any , of where we are going from this point on with increases to our fuel costs .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister responsible for public works , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
we had tried to look as to how we could decrease the price and at that time you were the chairman when the keewatin people were talking about the fuel prices .
at that time it was evident and understandable how we could decrease the prices of fuel .
my officials in petroleum products , i have asked them to look into how we can best deal with the fuel coming into nunavut .
at this time we are now working on this issue , and that is the work that we are doing for the future .
thank you .

on the fuel price increase and gas , oil and other products .
last year the fuel was purchased at a set price .
we all know that the world price of crude now is around 30 dollars us a barrel .
what was the price of the fuel purchased last year .
does the minister know what the price was of the fuel that was purchased last year .

minister responsible for public works , ms. thompson .

question 152 - 1 ( 3 ) :
fuel price increase and cost of transportation
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question is for the minister of public works &amp; housing regarding the fuel price increase .
in the minister &apos;s letter that we received , dated january 6 , the minister stated that part of the cost of the increase was due to the higher costs of transportation .
i would like to ask the minister if she could inform us as to how much more we had to pay in transportation costs this year over last year with the fuel .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .

mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i have a question for the minister of sustainable development , regarding the letter that i received .
there &apos;s nothing in there that makes reference to the work that has to be done right outside of my community .
if you could direct your staff to do some work , i would appreciate it .
this question is for the minister of sustainable development .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu .
i didn &apos;t hear a question .
possibly you could rephrase it .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :

minister responsible for sustainable development , mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
in regards to the question of mr. iqaqrialu , this is totally different than the question that he brought up earlier .
the department of sustainable development has the authority to direct anyone should there be any sites that have to be cleaned up .
in the letter there are some sites that we didn &apos;t identify in the report .
there &apos;s not much that we can do before we get direction from the members or anyone .

oral questions , mr. mclean .
question 154 - 1 ( 3 ) :
impact of fuel price increase
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na uqaqti .
my next question is to the minister responsible for petroleum products .
mr. speaker , we were hit with a 5 , 6 , 7 cent per litre rise in fuel prices last year based on the freight and the world price of crude .
i know this year like everything else the cost of living is going up everywhere and we are about to purchase fuel again .
i know that we didn &apos;t get the full impact on the last increase on the price of fuel .
but we are going to be buying fuel at possibly a higher cost again this year , plus the freight will probably go up again as well .
does the minister anticipate what kind of increase we will be looking at this year so we can maybe look at lessening the impact .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
minister responsible for public works , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
in regards to the increased prices , if there is an increase in anything the government eats it up .
we only raised the price by 5 cents , while we could have put it up more .
we had to put an increase on the gas prices .
in nunavut , the nunavut government gives at least a 50 % subsidy .
the mla for baker lake , this is a hypothetical question , so today i can &apos;t tell you how much it is going to increase next year .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
oral question , mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na uqaqti .
i don &apos;t have to stress the importance of gasoline and the impact it has on the traditional economy in nunavut .
we know that there are a lot of subsistence hunters and trappers out there and an increase in the cost of gasoline really impacts how people in nunavut put food on their table .
are we paying premiums when we purchase petroleum products and will this government look at bringing in fuel at a competitive price .
rather than not being so diligent on it .
thank you ms. minister .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. mclean two questions and you exceeded your allowable questions .
minister responsible for public works , ms. thompson .
ms. thompson :
thank you mr. speaker , we will look at the options that the member has suggested as a government i will direct the staff to start looking at that option .

question 155 - 1 ( 3 ) :
gjoa haven drinking water
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i would like to direct my question to the minister of health and social services .
i think everybody knows about gjoa haven and the water quality .
the water in gjoa haven is of poor quality and every body knows of that now .
we have heard it through the media .
through cbc when we were in iqaluit , and there was also an article done about it in the newspapers .
they would like to have good water .
my question to the minister is what are you going to do about the situation .

if you would respond please , mr. minister .
speaker :
mr. picco
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker let me first say that and speaking on behalf of this government , we realize that having that larva having that organism in the water is not acceptable .
what needs to be done is that some type of filter or some type of valve on the intake for the water in the water reservoir .
my understanding is mr. speaker that the sump pump that sucks the water out was maybe too close to the ground and thus the larva came in .
they are not a health risk .
but they don &apos;t look good for the appearance of the water , and i agree with him .
we are working with cgt , and cgt is looking at technical ways for fixing this problem as soon as possible .
thank you mr speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr speaker .
if we will do something about this problem right away could you give me a time line of when the people of gjoa haven will have clean water .
speaker :
thank you mr. puqiqnak . mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr speaker .
it is my understanding that cgt is working on this problem currently .
there has to be information gathered on how the water is transported from the reservoir , to the trucks and then to the domestic establishments - homes and offices and so on .
that work is continuing .
what i can say to the member after the session today i will meet with the member and we will find out exactly where we are right now .
we &apos;ll meet with mr. anawak whose department is working on this issue to try and rectify it .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .

oral questions .
mr. tootoo
question 157 - 1 ( 3 ) :
gasoline subsidies
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr speaker .
mr. speaker my question is for the minister of public works and services and it &apos;s in regards to petroleum products .
i &apos;d like to ask the minister if she could tell us exactly what is the level of subsidy for gasoline .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo , two questions for the minister responsible for public works .
hon. manitok thompson :
thank you .
for the subsidy we &apos; re paying nine million six hundred fifty-one thousand two hundred sixty-six . we &apos;re subsidising fuel for heating , aviation , gasoline and jet a-1 .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you ms. thompson .
oral questions . mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
i &apos;m pleased to hear that the total subsidy is 9.6 million dollars roughly .
does the minister have that broken down by gasoline , aviation and diesel fuel .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo . minister responsible for public works , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson :
the subsidy for heating fuel , we &apos;re subsidising three million eight hundred seventy four thousand two hundred twenty-nine .
for aviation fuel we &apos;re subsidizing twenty-eight thousand sixty hundred forty-four .
for gasoline the subsidy is two million six hundred forty- seven thousand five hundred and eighteen .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you ms. thompson . final supplementary , mr. tootoo .
mr tootoo :
thank you mr speaker .
mr. speaker it is nice to see that a large part of the fuel subsidy program is for heating fuel and gasoline , which affects most of the residents of nunavut .
mr. speaker i was wondering if the minister could provide us with some information on how they determine what the subsidies are for the different fuels .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister responsible for public works .
hon. manitok thompson :
thank you mr. speaker .
i do not have that information in front of me .
i have offered a presentation by the ppd staff to the regular members or any one else on the pricing of fuel .
if they &apos;re interested i will have to take that as notice .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you ms. thompson .
( interpretation ) there are quite a few members here that are unilingual speakers .
please utilize your interpreters .
mr. mclean .
question 158 - 1 ( 3 ) :
decision making process for subsidies mr. mclean :
the nine million dollars the government puts into home heating fuel etc .
mr. speaker , my question is how does cabinet or the financial management board decide on how much a subsidy is going to be on petroleum products every year .
is it just thrown out there that we are going to charge eighty cents a litre for gasoline and seventy cents a litre on fuel oil .
is there a certain criteria to show how much is a gas subsidy or how much is a petroleum products subsidy .
how is that determined .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. mclean .
who are you addressing your question to .
mr. mclean :
who ever decides .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean , if there are two ministers then the premier is supposed answer the questions .
mr. mclean :
i guess i would have to ask the minister of finance , because i guess he writes the cheque to subsidize the petroleum products program .
so would the minister answer me how he figures out how much he is going to subsidize the petroleum products division every year .
is it just a ball park figure or is it some kind of magic formula .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
minister of finance , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , the petroleum products division as you know is a bit separate from government .
they operate with a revolving fund that has certain guidelines as far as they &apos;re not able to enter into a too large deficit position as a result of the sale of petroleum products .
i don &apos;t have the full details on how that works but i can provide that information to all members .
i can tell you there was a request for considerably more than the five cents that was passed on recognizing the significance of the increase nunavut-wide .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
has the minister of finance got some kind of plan in place other than what he just explained to me to make sure that doesn &apos;t happen .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
minister of finance .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
a very good question from the member .
i can &apos;t remember the exact time frame but i believe they have several months to put that together , to report back to the financial management board .
thank you .

oral questions . mr. irqittuq .
question 159 - 1 ( 3 ) :
changes to decentralization
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
regarding community empowerment , i would like to ask this question to the premier about decentralization .
they had stated how many staff would be going to these communities . for example , igloolik was to receive 72.5 positions at that time , the beginning of the government .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
yes i have written a letter to the municipalities and i &apos;m sure that you have also received a copy .
as you are aware there are some positions filled already in igloolik , in fact the infrastructure is not complete yet and some of the housing is not available for the staff .
so if the staff move up there right away they won &apos;t have any housing and there would be housing problems .
so we have to look in to all these details and the staff need infrastructure to work .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
oral questions , mr. tootoo .
question 160 - 1 ( 3 ) :
fuel purchase process
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question is for the minister responsible for petroleum products .
mr. speaker , the increase in fuel , as indicated in here january 6 letter , indicates that it was due to the rising price of the global price of crude going up .
i would like to ask the minister what process is used and how we purchase the fuel for nunavut .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister responsible for public works , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. thompson .
oral questions .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
she also indicated that usually they increase the price in the fall .
again , i guess i would ask what led to the delay of the price increase until january .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister responsible for public works , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the fuel that we purchase for the communities is transported and put in the tanks .
we don &apos;t see the actual price and the landed cost of this fuel until later .
we don &apos;t know the actual price or whether there is going to be a hike in the rates when the fuel is landed at the community level .
i didn &apos;t know whether we were going into a deficit situation or not when the fuel was landed .
we had to do an analysis of the costs and whether we are going to stay within budget or whether we are going to have a deficit before we set the price .
after we do a review of all the paperwork then we make a decision whether there is going to be an increase in the fuel rate .
thank you .
speaker :
third supplementary , mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , the minister indicated that they don &apos;t know ahead of time what the fuel and transportation costs are .
mr. speaker , is the minister saying that they just say we &apos;ve got all these empty tanks , just fill them up and tell us what it is going to cost us after .
i guess my question is , what is the process .
is there a service contract in place for the supply and delivery of those products .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister responsible for public works , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
well you have to fill the tanks because we can &apos;t operate the communities without petroleum products .
we have to buy petroleum products .
there are all kinds of factors put in there before we see the actual costs .
like i said there is 9 million , 661 thousand plus that we pay out , mr. speaker .
we don &apos;t see the actual costs , there is not only the purchase of the gas , there are other cost factors which eat into the budget .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. thompson .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i appreciate the minister going over the information that she provided to us already .
however , i believe my question was asking whether there is a service contract in place for the supply and delivery of these products .
i would still like to have this answered .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister responsible for public works , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i don &apos;t have the break down in front of me so i will get one .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. thompson .
taken as notice .
oral questions , mr. nutarak .
question 161 - 1 ( 3 ) :
community costs for fuel
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
part of the question that i was going to ask was already answered by the minister of public works .
there are different rates at the community level .
for example it will cost x amount of dollars in arviat , it will cost an x amount in arctic bay and so on .
there are different rates in each of the individual communities .
so what i would like to see the minister produce is exactly how much each community is paying for petroleum products .
some of the communities rates were increased by 6 or 7 cents .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
minister responsible for public works , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i will put one together and give you the various rates in each of the individual communities , but the department of finance agreed to 5 cents .
i will give this to the appropriate minister .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. thompson .
oral question period is over .
we will go back to the orders of the day .

ikuma working group report
hon. ed picco :
good morning .
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , later today i will table a copy of the ikuma report which is a comprehensive document developed by the ikuma working group .
this document represents the first major step towards the creation of a functioning power corporation in nunavut .
it is anticipated that the nunavut power corporation will be a made in nunavut solution for the provision of electrical power to the residents of nunavut .
mr. speaker , as the members are aware the northwest territories power corporation , with its &apos; headquarters over there in hay river , currently provides power to nunavut through a transition agreement .
a transition agreement , mr. speaker , that expires march 31st , 2001 .
between now and then it is critical that the nunavut power corporation develops the capacity to provide these services to nunavummiut .
i am pleased to inform you that a director has been identified within our own public service to lead this government initiative .
this individual will work very closely over the next fourteen months with the president of the nunavut power corporation .
we are now publicly advertising throughout nunavut , mr. speaker , for the position of president of the nunavut power corporation .
it is also anticipated that this position will be filled by april 2000 .
following the approval by the legislative assembly of the main estimates , i will be in a better position to provide you with further updates on this very important work .
in consultation with the cabinet and you the mlas , and the public , we will have to make many decisions .
we will have to develop the corporate structure of the power corporation , we will have to determine how much capacity can reasonably be developed within nunavut before march 31st , 2001 .
mr. speaker , i look forward to discussing the ikuma report with the members of this assembly later this week .
thank you , mr. speaker .

mr. speaker , i rise to pay tribute to inusiq sarah akavak who died violently and tragically in iqaluit recently .
inusiq was a well known and well loved resident of iqaluit originally from kimmirut .
she worked very hard supporting her family by selling jewellery in public places in iqaluit in the evenings , often with her beloved daughter at her side .
she also worked very hard during the day , housekeeping in houses and as a hotel chambermaid .
it seemed inusiq always had a smile and a kind word for everyone whether or not they made a purchase from her .
it also seems that at the same time she was coping with violence in her personal life and that she carried this burden largely on her own .
they are especially saddened because it seemed that this tragedy occurred because of severe family distress .
mr. speaker , my community of iqaluit is reeling from the pressures of growth and rapid change .
it is my sincere hope that we strive to build nunavut and make our own new government work .
we will also pay attention to helping our citizens cope with the social pressures and costs of change and growth .
sadly tragedies such as the death of inusiq remind us of the need for a strengthened health and social service programs which can reach out and offer help to those that are suffering .
funeral services were held for inusiq in kimmirut yesterday , mr. speaker .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
we will send a sympathy letter to the family that has lost a loved family member .

ma &apos;na uqaqti .
i am very proud to recognize a young man that grew up in baker lake and went from kindergarten to grade 12 .
i watched him grow up and i kept an eye on him because i am friends with his parents .
far too often up here we hear the nought &apos;s against the education system , that it is second rate and we are not really on par with anybody else .
he just recently received the governor general &apos;s award for academic excellence and achievement .
mr. speaker , it shows you that people in nunavut can achieve academic excellence with the right kind of support behind them .
so i would like everybody in this house to recognize mr. jeffrey hart from baker lake as a winner of the governor general &apos;s award for academic achievement .

item 6 :
oral questions
question 162 - 1 ( 3 ) :
social worker for kimmirut
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you very much mr. speaker .
ever since i was elected , i have been questioning the minister of health and social services on this issue .
kimmirut has been waiting over a year now for a social worker .
they require this staff member .
my question is for the minister , whether anything is happening with that issue .
speaker :
thank you .
mr. akesuk .
mr. picco
hon. ed picco :
the member is correct .
the position was vacant for about 14 months .
the baffin regional health and social services board has worked very hard in staffing the position and it is my understanding that a qualified applicant has been identified .
there is housing available , the interview is booked and the person should be in place over the next two weeks or so .
that is my understanding .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
oral questions .
mr. iqaqrialu .
question 163 - 1 ( 3 ) :
decentralization for smaller communities
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i have a question for the premier .
will the small communities benefit from the issue of decentralization .
that is my question for the premier , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. premier
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier . mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i think if you don &apos;t have a full commitment for the smaller communities , i wonder if you have plans or strategies for small communities for decentralization .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. premier
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
yes we like to support the small communities and we would like to support the hamlet in the very near future and we would like to see them pursue this issue with us .
thank you mr. speaker
speaker :
mr. alakannuark .
question 164 - 1 ( 3 ) :
air link between keewatin and kitikmeot region
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question is for the minister of transportation .
is the minister considering taking a look at a route between keewatin and kitikmeot region .
thank you mr. speaker
speaker ( interpretation ) :
minister of transportation , mr. anawak
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
yes , we have been looking at this issue whether there could be alternate routes between the two regions .
whether it &apos;s by air or sea , we are looking at this mr. speaker .
thank you .
speaker :
mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you sir .
mr. speaker , the reason that i raised this question is to find out how soon you will be looking at the aircraft routes between the keewatin and kitikmeot region
speaker ( interpretation ) :
minister of transportation , mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
we can &apos;t order the airlines what to do but perhaps the airlines themselves are looking at alternate routes .
there have been discussions but i &apos;m not sure when we will actually see those new routes between the keewatin and kitikmeot region .
speaker :
thank you mr. anawak .
mr. tootoo
question 165 - 1 ( 3 ) :
fuel subsidies
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question is for the minister responsible for public works and services and petroleum products .
mr. speaker , yesterday the minister indicated that the total subsidy by the government , by her department , was 9.6 million dollars .
mr. speaker the numbers that she provided in the house yesterday on the breakdown of those subsidies only come up to about 7 million dollars unless i got a number wrong .
mr. speaker , i am wondering if there is another area of subsidy that was missed and where the other 2 million dollars in subsidies go .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
the minister responsible for public works , manitok thompson .
hon. manitok thompson :
thank you mr. speaker .
i just mentioned heating , aviation , gasoline and jet a1 fuel but there are other subsidies . they are heating fuel , motor , aviation fuel , naphtha and av-gas .
the total figure is still nine million six hundred fifty one thousand two hundred sixty six dollars .
if the member wants me to tell him the rest of the subsidies , i can do so or i can table this document .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you ms. thompson .
oral questions .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker :

minister responsible for public works , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson :

i guess another thing i have to remind you guys is i sent out a little thing for you guys to sign .
please pass it along .
i will do that - i will table the document .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you ms. thompson .
oral questions .
mr. puqiqnak .
question 166 - 1 ( 3 ) :
gjoa haven water quality
mr. puqiqnak :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question is for minister responsible for community governments and my question is regarding gjoa haven &apos;s water reservoir .
we all are aware that i raised this issue yesterday about some worms in the water supply and mr. speaker , i have a question .
the water reservoir at risk is in gjoa haven .
we have problems with the water system .
so , mr. speaker it was previously fixed and we had a line about four miles going to our community and the water reservoir is very small now , mr. speaker .
but right now , the water reservoir in gjoa haven is causing problems and the minister of justice has been working on decentralization to our community .
there is also the fact that our population is growing and decentralization is impacting on our community .
mr. speaker , my question to the minister is whether he will address this issue regarding the problems with the water reservoir in gjoa haven , mr. speaker .
will the minister address this issue for gjoa haven .
mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
mr anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
so we are waiting for some parts , but i &apos;m very sorry that we are taking much longer than we expected mr. speaker .
perhaps today or tomorrow we will give you an update on what is happening with this issue in gjoa haven .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you . mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker , i remember the issue of the water system that &apos;s been in place and hasn &apos;t been used in a long time because the container is so small .
is the minister saying they will be using that existing water filter system that &apos;s in place or are they ordering parts for another water system .
speaker :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
mr. anawak
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
sorry , to clarify the issue , mr. speaker , when i mentioned that we have ordered some parts perhaps tomorrow i will give you a more detailed update mr. speaker .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
perhaps , i don &apos;t think that item has been budgeted .
but , perhaps they will have to look for some funding elsewhere from their department .
is there a way they will address this issue in gjoa haven , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. anawak
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
we are all aware that we have some concerns on health issues , especially with the water supply .
so i will be sitting down with the minister of health and social services and look at this issue very closely .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
question 167 - 1 ( 3 ) :
hall beach school
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , there have been a number of petitions from hall beach for the school system .
perhaps the minister of education has written a letter , but i don &apos;t recall seeing any of those letters .
can we get an update on what is happening with the school in hall beach .
thank you mr. speaker
speaker :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
mr. arvaluk
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
we &apos;re short mr. speaker , in terms of capital dollars for nunavut , so we &apos;re only dealing with emergency or priority issues .
perhaps at the committee of the whole we can look at this item a little more closely .
where you would like to put it in a twenty year plan and look at a twenty year plan for capital in education .
we would like to prepare plans that will look at long term plans instead of short term .
if you only look at short term plans it doesn &apos;t really help .
so i want to work very closely with the members to prepare a long term plan for education .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
mr. irqittuq
mr irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
it is my understanding that you will just be reviewing 2000 / 2001 plans for hall beach .
mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
we will be looking at all the schools in nunavut .
we have included hall beach in the 2000 / 2001 plans and we will be doing some inspections on that basis .
so hall beach has been included in our plans .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the minister mentioned that you are looking at the architectural plans in terms where the location will be for these schools .
you gave some examples , so can you give us some clarification mr. speaker .
thank you , mr. speaker
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i was just giving you an example of the location because we have seen a lot of schools built .
some are improperly structured and there are some other problems .
pond inlet is one example and the other one is baker lake .
i was just giving you an example of the foundations of these facilities because spring and winter effect the ground and the base , for example in clyde river .
the reason we want to see a long term plan is because it would be more beneficial for these communities .
if we put in a twenty year plan i think it will be more beneficial for these communities , using our funds for the greater good of the communities , mr. speaker .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
mr. irqittuq
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. speaker back in december we were in hall beach .
the minister was asked at the public meeting when we would see a new school .
the minister responded to that question and i would ask him to explain how you responded at that time .
would you clarify that here .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
yes i could clarify what i said in hall beach mr. speaker .
i think it would be more appropriate if i could respond to that question later because if i respond to it now i would take up too much time mr. speaker .
you would have to look at architectural plans and other plans and the long term plans we have for the school facilities .
you would have to look at long term plans for population forecasted from kindergarten up to grade twelve .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
mr. o &apos;brien
question 168 - 1 ( 3 ) :
manitoba / keewatin power grid
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question today is for the minister responsible for the power corporation in nunavut .
mr. speaker , some time ago a committee was struck to review and study the possibility of a power grid between manitoba and the keewatin .
mr speaker we spoke about , at great length , the increase in fuel costs and the effect it &apos;s having on the people of nunavut .
my question to the minister is , can he give the members an update as to the status of this study and proposal that has been ongoing for the past year and a half .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister responsible for the power corporation .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker just a point of clarification , is the member asking about the ikuma working group report , or is he asking about the pre -feasibility study by manitoba hydro .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr picco .
could you rephrase your question mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
so i think it &apos;s fairly clear where my question is coming from .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister for the power corporation - mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker the pre-feasibility study was delivered officially to the government in mid-september .
i guess we are fortunate that on sunday and monday a delegation from manitoba , including some representatives from manitoba hydro will be here in rankin inlet and will be giving a presentation .
my understanding , mr. speaker , is that presentation is on the pre-feasibility study of manitoba hydro .
at that time i will be meeting with the minister responsible for the power corporation for manitoba hydro to discuss issues surrounding the pre-feasibility study .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
oral questions . mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i think it &apos;s very important to point out this is a pre-feasibility .
it &apos;s broad in its implication and its assumptions .
there are major impacts on environmental assessments , on parks , on protected areas and indeed , mr. speaker , there are huge capital dollar implications .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker .
thank you mr. picco .
oral questions . mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
it is my understanding that presently we &apos;re paying seventy cents per kilowatt hour for power in the keewatin .
would he consider that significant .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister responsible for the power corporation .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
what i am saying mr. speaker , is that this government will be meeting with the manitoba officials .
there will be an in-depth presentation by manitoba hydro on this pre-feasibility study .
we will have to look at it over the next couple of weeks to see where we go from there .
there are major cost implications , infrastructure implications into the millions and hundreds of millions of dollars .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
final supplementary , mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , prior to christmas a number of the members , ministers and the premier in winnipeg attended a presentation regarding a road linkage and power grid .
there was a fair bit of detail given and the information provided to the members .
can the minister tell me what has changed if anything from that presentation to what he &apos;s expecting in this new presentation that is coming up this week .
if there have been any significant changes from what we heard at that point and what he expects to hear this week .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister responsible for the power corporation .
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
it is being done by another government .
there has to be a comprehensive analysis .
there needs to be a cost / benefit analysis on the dollars involved .
my understanding , mr. speaker , is that the pre-feasibility study will lead to , of course , a feasibility study , which may take three to five . .
&gt; &gt; audio unavailable
( hon. ed picco continues ) ... rivers between here and churchill manitoba .
so the report is broad in its implications .
as the minister responsible for the nunavut power corporation , i have not had an opportunity to sit down with my colleagues in manitoba hydro to discuss the issue .
i will have that opportunity over the next couple of days .
but i cannot commit to this house the spending of hundreds of millions of dollars until a comprehensive analysis , mr. speaker , a cost / benefit analysis is done on the report .
again this is a pre-feasibility study .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. tootoo .
question 169 - 1 ( 3 ) :
permanent solution to gjoa haven water problem
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker . mr. speaker , my question &apos;s for the minister responsible for community government &amp; transportation .
the member from gjoa haven has been talking about an issue with their water reservoir problems that they &apos;re having with the blood worms .
mr. speaker , in an editorial in the paper on monday , the mayor indicated that it has been a priority for the community for the last 20 years .
are you looking at a solutions to fix this problem once and for all .
thank you . mr. speaker
speaker :
before i recognise the minister responsible for transportation , mr. tootoo you were referring to an article in the newspaper , can you rephrase your question .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
i &apos;d like to remind the members that articles in the papers are not supposed to be questioned in this house unless they are tabled .
so when you are questioning please don &apos;t use articles from the newspapers .
minister responsible for community government &amp; transportation , mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
mr. speaker , on issues of priority , in terms of these kind of problems if it is indeed an emergency we deal with it as an emergency , mr speaker .
i think we all like to provide quality service for all our communities in nunavut in terms of their water reservoirs .
so it &apos;s being looked at as an emergency issue mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. anawak .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
i understand there &apos;s things going on to that effect and i was asking if there is a permanent long term solution that will be looked at by his department right now .
thank you mr speaker .

diavik mine overlap agreement
mr. mclean :
could the minister responsible update me on where nunavut stands in this agreement to date .
thank you mr. speaker
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
minister kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk :
we have been very active on this file just the last little while .
however , the department of indian affairs and northern development has the final say as to if we can be included in this agreement .
so we have looked at the other options to ensure that the concerns of the nunavut communities and the inuit organizations can be closely monitored for the environmental impact which may be caused .
so right now we are looking at a new development of a trans-boundary agreement which will address the concerns of the people of nunavut and also the organizations and the governments .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. kilabuk .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na uqaqti .

mr. kattuk .
i would like to remind the members that we &apos;ll be giving those members who haven &apos;t asked questions a first chance .
question 171 - 1 ( 3 ) :
five year plans
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr speaker . my question is directed to the premier .
it &apos;s in regards to the government of the northwest territories and the five year plan that used to be created .
i &apos;m assuming that the nunavut government will be looking at setting five year plans .
when the nunavut government was created did you keep using the five year plan that was put together by the government of the northwest territories or not .
speaker :
minister of finance .
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr speaker .
we made a commitment to the house and to municipalities who had raised the issues as well that we would be developing a five year capital plan .
as the work continues on that with the departments we expect within a couple of months to have that .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you mr. ng .
oral questions .
mr. kattuk
mr kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
so do i understand then that the five year plans that were created by the government of the northwest territories will no longer be used by this government
speaker :
minister of finance .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr speaker .
mr speaker , i wouldn &apos;t say that it wouldn &apos;t be used , a lot of planning work has taken place in the government of the northwest territories capital planning initiatives .
as you know , that information has been retained by the government of nunavut .
so the new government of nunavut five year capital plan would be a reflection of some of those priorities .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
oral questions .
mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
because of course the hamlet councils identified their priorities with the previous government .
are you going to be asking the hamlet councils then what they would like to see in the five year capital plan .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you .
minister of finance , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
so that will be taken into consideration .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .

my question is for the minister of culture , language , elders &amp; youth .
when we were touring the communities one thing that kept coming up at just about every community , was inuit qaujimajatuqangit .
we were told by the people out there that inuit qaujimajatuqangit is fading .
for example , igloo building , hunting techniques , sewing and so on .
i would like to ask you how far along is the planning for the preservation of inuit qaujimajatuqangit .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
minister of culture , language , elders &amp; youth .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
i thank the member for his important question .
mr. speaker our planning for our future training of the northern people in regards to inuit qaujimajatuqangit is progressing as we speak .
the people that are going to be involved in this inuit qaujimajatuqangit process , are our own employees , nti , nsdc and others .
our plan for the future is that right now we are working on this program and i will be tabling details on this soon in the house .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. havioyak .
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
you stated that you will be working with nti , but i see this as an emergency , as a priority as there are fewer and fewer elders who have this knowledge .
i would like to see something implemented before our elders are gone .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
i heard three questions .
minister responsible for culture , language , elders &amp; youth , mr. havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i know our elders are getting fewer .
we are trying to make it move faster and work together faster , but also right now we are trying to do it right .
i hear what you are saying but we need to find out for the future , what kind of future we will be having and work together with nti and nsdc .
when we get all the information together i will let you know .
the language and stories before they are all gone , we want all that information from the elders .
i recognize that but right now we don &apos;t really know the future .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. havioyak .
mr. iqaqrialu .
question 173 - 1 ( 3 ) :
clyde river power rates
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to direct this question to the minister of the power corporation .
in my community of clyde river , they built a power plant but with it came greatly increased power costs .
this is kind of scary today when there &apos;s very high unemployment at the community level .
so i would like to ask you mr. minister , on the proposed bills , how that would effect the rates .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister responsible for the nunavut power corporation .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
thank you very much for the question .
i tried to explain in the house over the past several months when this question has come up what is happening with the community based rates .
we are trying to work within the time frame and the parameters of that , to negate that type of increase .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
oral questions .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
it &apos;s going to have a very big effect at the community level .
even if it is only 35 % it doesn &apos;t matter .
the nunavut government are trying to set up a system that would suit nunavut .
we are the ones that want to make things a little bit easier for the people of nunavut .
if it effects nunavut then everyone is going to be effected .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , that is an excellent question and it goes back to the harmonisation of the rate balances that we have in nunavut , and we realize there is some concern there .
we realize as a government and it is pointed out in the ikuma report , that the rate balancing at the present time may be unfair in certain instances .
the cost per kilowatt hour for power in nunavut goes from about 41 cents to a high of a little over 61 cents in nunavut .
the subsidy program is still in place .
they would be paid for that and indeed at that time the government of nunavut would also be an intervenor .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
oral questions .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
again this question is for the minister of the power corporation .
have you looked for any funding that could be used to subsidize the power rates .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister responsible for the power corporation , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , since the advent of power in nunavut and indeed since the nwt power corporation was set up we do have in place the territorial power subsidy program .
everyone of us here that pays our power bill receives a subsidy .
so that subsidy is in place .
that &apos;s one of the things that comes out in the ikuma report .
so that power subsidy is in place , we are subsidized .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. picco .

minister of finance , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , it is my understanding and as i said we did hit every community in nunavut , the 25 incorporated communities .
i can &apos;t say that every single mayor or every single municipality put forward a presentation .
i know in the case of iqaluit , that the town council met separately with their mlas and i don &apos;t have the outcomes of those discussions .
but certainly there was input throughout nunavut and from all municipalities .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .

mr. tootoo :

minister of finance , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
well , mr. speaker , the five year capital plan is a government of nunavut document and in the past it has been a government of the nwt document .
it has never been developed by municipalities .
and of course , the elected mlas as well provide input into that same document and try to formalize some of the needs and then make recommendations to put forward to address those needs .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
oral questions .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i guess what i was looking for , was that opportunity given to all the municipalities for this budget and the capital plan that is being developed right now .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of finance , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
mr. speaker , i think i indicated earlier that there is no formal government of nunavut five year planning document as it stands right now .
we are working now to complete that within the next couple of months .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .

speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of finance , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , they have had various opportunities to provide input .
the primary contacts for all the municipalities are the community government &amp; transportation officials that are set up and established throughout the regions to provide that liaison with the municipal councils .
the second opportunity of course is through their mlas and finally through the budget consultation process that took place this past fall , as far as for the current year budget .

mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
i wonder if the minister can give us some background and rationale for this additional expenditure that is required for finance and administration .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. minister
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
certain major projects that weren &apos;t completed prior to april 1 , 1999 became an expense for this current year .
primarily in those areas of human resources and payroll systems and income support systems .
development work has started on more systems than originally anticipated and there were unanticipated items that allocated to it budgets as well .
this was because the exceeded expectations caused additional services and equipment to be required to support that mr. chairman .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. o &apos;brien any further comments .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
minister do you expect any requirement for additional funding prior to the end of this fiscal year for this particular project .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. minister if you would respond please .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman we do expect that there will be some additional requirements but those requirements will be funded internally through unexpended funds and savings .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien , anything else .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr chairman , this for the most part is a very lean money bill .
having said that does the minister expect coming before the house to further request additional dollars before this fiscal year is up .
whether it be for this project or any other .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. minister if would you respond please .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
if they require any internal re-allocation for whatever reasons , but our responsibility would be to report back on that if those decisions were made at the financial management board level .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman , just a final comment or question .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. minister .
hon. kelvin ng :
for example , gjoa haven with the water situation that we talked about earlier today , and if there was some immediate need there and cg &amp; t had some specific request .
then we would look at that request and again if it were approved then it would come back to the house .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. o &apos;brien , any further comments .
your last one you said .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
i would find it somewhat strange if another money bill would come forward , before the end of the fiscal year unless it were an absolute emergency .
so my question to you is that with the exception of an emergency wouldn &apos;t it be highly unlikely that you would need to come before the house again for another supplementary appropriation .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. minister if you would respond please .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr chairman , it probably would be .
i would say that we probably wouldn &apos;t .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , the minister had indicated that a portion of the funding is going to a human resource and payroll system .
i was just wondering if he could indicate as to what system the department is using right now .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. minister , if you would you clarify that point please .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
the government of nunavut currently has adp in ottawa as our contractor for our payroll services .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman . the minister had indicated that this was something that didn &apos;t get completed prior to april 1 .
has adp been the contractor that we &apos;ve been using all along .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. tootoo . mr. minister if you would respond please .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , originally through the office of the interim commissioner there was a joint project with the gnwt to develop peoplesoft , which was the human resource payroll system .
that &apos;s where we are now .
they are the ones providing the service for us .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister of finance .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i guess i &apos;m asking there &apos;s been two different contractors being used .
is it the same system being used , or is it a different system being used .
thank you mr. chairman
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of finance .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman it is two completely different systems .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
in light of the minister &apos;s comments , i take it that whatever work was being done prior to april 1 on the peoplesoft project was basically scrapped .
i &apos;m wondering if the minister could indicate the amount of money it cost this government to scrap that project .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of finance .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , prior to march 31 , 1999 , 2.3 million dollars was spent on the peoplesoft human resource payroll side of things .
since april 1 , 1999 , we have put we &apos;ve put 1.2 million dollars into the payroll .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
is the minister saying that there was 2.3 million dollars paid for this program that we didn &apos;t use .
and 1.2 million paid for the program that we are using right now .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of finance , your response .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , no it was 2.3 million dollars prior to march 31 and 1.2 since april 1 for the peoplesoft program .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister of finance , any further comments . mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
so it was a total of 3.5 million dollars basically chucked out the window .
surprising , maybe just in light of that what have we spent on this new program that we are using right now .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo . minister of finance , further response if you would like .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
okay , go ahead mr. tootoo if you would like to respond .
mr. victor tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
the peoplesoft project was developed at the time the oic was in place prior to april 1 1999 .
it was a joint project with the gnwt and certain commitments were signed on to at the time through the oic .
decisions were made to develop a joint program that both governments could use .
during that review we decided that the project just wasn &apos;t happening fast enough basically and that there were very many deadlines that weren &apos;t being met .
a lot of the work was being done in yellowknife and we didn &apos;t have a lot of input into the process .
we decided that the project may not happen and that it wasn &apos;t an option for our government to not have a payroll system so we looked at other options .
we were looking for a bit more simple , cost effective way of doing business and this was one of the decisions that we made in that regard .
thank you mr. chairman .

mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
i brought up a question this morning and i would like to make further clarification on the point that i was going to make .
what is this money going to be used for .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
mr. minister of finance , a response .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairperson . mr. chairperson this is for providing for the implementation of a labour market supplement program for nurses .
the program is geared toward monetary incentives through an annual retention and a one time recruitment bonus .
the department of health is proposing to operate this program for two years , with this year being the start of it .
it is similar to what the northwest territories has recently announced in their program .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister of finance .
jobie , did that answer your question .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
yes it did .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
directorate , 362 thousand under special warrants , any further comments .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
the minister indicated that this was to be used for providing bonuses to the nurses as the minister of health and social services had announced .
does this cover off all of the nurses working throughout nunavut .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. minister if you would respond please .
hon. kelvin ng :
from what i understand from the minister of health and social services that is the case .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister of finance .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairperson , when i say nurses i guess i mean all nurses including , does it include cnas , the certified nursing assistants as well .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. minister of finance , if you would respond please .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
it is my understanding that it is specific to nurses only .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i know that there are a number of certified nursing assistants that play a crucial role in some of the health facilities across nunavut .
in iqaluit for example there are some people , some nurses , cnas there that have had over 20 years experience .
is there going to be something to be able to recognise the valuable role that these people play as well .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
particularly the health and social services area . we know that there &apos;s high stress and high demands on their positions .
i appreciate the member bringing forward this issue . i &apos;ve had several discussions with the certified nursing assistants .
so we &apos;re aware of it and there is a recognition of those services . thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. chairman , the amount of 362 thousand that we are now looking at is part of the supplementary appropriation .
is there any reason why it wasn &apos;t covered off in that as opposed to doing it through the appropriation here .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. minister for finance .
hon. kelvin ng :

you will see clothing made here in rankin inlet , of course , and clothing from several other communities throughout nunavut .
the show will feature traditional designs , modern fashions and examples of clothing produced by some of the community based businesses with support from the nunavut development corporation .
young people today can take pride in making traditional clothing and in the arts and crafts .
our young people want to see how we can use the resources of the land and inuit qaujimajatuqangit to create opportunities for the young generation and for the generations that will follow .
this commitment should give us all great hope for the future .
i urge you to show these young people your support and spend an enjoyable evening as their guest at the show of traditional and hand made fashions .

mr. premier
minister &apos;s statement 49 - 1 ( 3 ) :
intergovernmental partnerships
hon. paul okalik :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , our government is developing partnerships with jurisdictions across canada . during the past six months the government of nunavut has participated in a series of federal , provincial and territorial conferences .
i joined the provincial and territorial premiers in quebec city at the annual premiers &apos; conference .
ministers have participated in a wide range of national meetings with their counterparts from the territories and provinces , as well as the government of canada .
a series of meetings are ongoing considering the social union agreement and how it can be used as a guide to enable the governments to better address the needs of their residents .
in december i participated in a meeting of aboriginal and national political leaders to discuss aboriginal input into the social policies of canada .
mr. speaker , as a premier i have had the opportunity to visit a number of provinces in the fall .
i was a guest of premier tobin of newfoundland where we had the opportunity to discuss issues of common concern .
in november , in conjunction with the major mining conference attended by many of the mayors from kivalliq in winnipeg , i had the opportunity to meet manitoba premier gary doer .
in all of these meetings nunavut has been welcomed as the newest partner .
our representatives are being given equal opportunities with their colleagues to raise issues of political importance to our people and reflective of our unique situation .
our distinct challenges and unique experiences are something that our colleagues and other governments are eager to learn about .
last year in june , our government recognized the need to increase co-operation with our neighbours .
this mou will prepare the way for wide-ranging co-operation between nunavut and our neighbour to the south , as together we will confirm our close ties .
next month in conjunction with the arctic winter games , i will travel to whitehorse to attend the second annual northern leaders forum .
as territorial leaders , we will continue to work together to achieve a series of pan-territorial goals including the devolution of powers from the federal government .
it respects and blends the best of inuit and non-inuit culture and makes our community stronger .
during the coming months there will be a number of intergovernmental meetings including the western premiers conference in brandon in may and our annual premiers &apos; conference in winnipeg this august .
( interpretation ends ) let me emphasize that participation in such a wide range of meetings is of great importance to our government .
while nunavut has distinct challenges , there are a number of concerns that we share with other provinces and territories and together we are forging stronger working relationships to manage these issues .
the experience gained from these meetings and the strong relationships built between governments are valuable in developing a strong presence for nunavut on the national scene .

support for smaller communities
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i rise today to express the concern of my community and my constituency .
mr. speaker , all the communities of nunavut are growing in population and size annually .
mr. speaker , in view of the future in nunavut it seems bleak since everything is getting to be expensive , and the cost of living is being increased all the time now .
recent examples of increases which have been very hard on my constituency are :
the postage rate increase for parcels :
fuel prices have increased on new year &apos;s eve , airline tickets have been increased by first air .
in clyde river we face challenges with possible power rates increases to pay for the new power plant , mr. speaker .
all the nunavut communities have to have adequate operational funds .
larger communities in nunavut are also growing with government offices , government housing and government staff .
i know that all this growth takes a lot of money from the budget of the government of nunavut .
my constituents live in two small communities , clyde river and broughton island .
thank you , mr. speaker .

mr. o &apos;brien .
member &apos;s statement 102 - 1 ( 3 ) :
nunavut / manitoba road and power links
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker i rise today to speak about a subject that is a very important priority in my constituency and this region .
that is the building of roads and power links between nunavut and manitoba .
mr. speaker , this exciting project is about building partnerships with other governments to build our future in nunavut .
it is about creating jobs for our people in road construction and maintenance , in tourism and resource development .
it is about reducing our heavy reliance on expensive oil and reducing pollution produced by fossil fuel .
it is about linking nunavut with canada .
mr. speaker , this project is also about common sense investing in lowering our very high cost of living and building our economy .
for years now , northern governments have been committed to looking at the feasibility and benefits of north / south highway and transmission links .
mr. speaker , in june 1996 , the government of nwt and manitoba agreed to work together on transportation and energy links .
the report was produced in november 1999 on road corridors .
the study also looked at both winter road and all weather road options .
mr. speaker , five possible routes were identified between nunavut and manitoba .
the road would begin in churchill , gilmorden lake .
the options include links to arviat , whale cove , chesterfield , rankin and baker lake .
the first step , mr. speaker , would be to build a winter road which would also be the base for the construction of an all weather road .
another major study was undertaken on behalf of the nwt power corporation and manitoba hydro .
two possible routes for transmission lines have been mapped out between churchill and rankin inlet .
arviat being the closest community would also be served from this line .
as all the members know , manitoba has an excess of hydro power which costs about one tenth the cost of our diesel and generated power .
the manitoba power grid also already goes all the way to churchill which is only about two hundred miles from my home community of arviat .
every year , mr. speaker , our southern neighbours in manitoba export about 300 million dollars worth of goods and services to this region .
i know that the province of manitoba puts a high value on this trade .
i also believe that the province of manitoba would like to do its part to strengthen these links of trade and friendship .
the province of manitoba shared the cost of these major studies with the government of canada .
today we have further proof of their commitment to working with us with their presence here in nunavut , the honourable gary doer , the premier of manitoba and his distinguished delegation .
i believe mr. speaker , that working together we can persuade the government of canada to support the building of links between nunavut and canada .
nunavut is the only jurisdiction in canada which does not have a link to the rest of the country .
mr. speaker , this project requires boldness and vision .
i want to commend our premier for his early and strong commitment in exploring and developing stronger links between our territory and our neighbouring province .
i also look forward to working with the honourable ed picco , minister responsible for the power corporation to examine options for how we can restructure the new nunavut power corporation .
we must also pay attention to the potential to develop alternative sources of energy .
mr. speaker , the world price of oil went over thirty dollars a barrel just recently and we are in a very vulnerable situation .
mr. speaker , also we would like to thank the honourable jack anawak , minister of transportation for his support and attendance at the meeting in winnipeg last fall where these reports were unveiled .
mr. speaker , i look forward to working with the minister to develop a long range plan for the winter road and permanent road from nunavut to manitoba .
mr. speaker , i know that these are major challenges , that size and the impact of this project is daunting .
however , mr. speaker , if we move in small steps we can accomplish this .
mr. speaker , in closing , this great country was not built by leaders who focussed on why you could not do something .
it was built by leaders who said &quot; we can do it - lets find a way &quot; .
mr. speaker , i look forward to making continuous progress on this exciting project .
thank you .

member &apos;s statement 103 - 1 ( 3 ) :
rankin inlet family violence project
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker i rise today to speak of a project started here in rankin inlet .
this project involves trying to deal with family violence .
we have some individuals who are here that are working on this project .
valerie stubbs from our department of justice , we have bonnie tulloch , we also have judge browne from the nunavut government justice department .
they have had quite a number of meetings with people in rankin inlet .
they first tried this out as a pilot project to find out what they could do in counselling people going to court for family violence .
there will be counselling provided to the abusers and the counsellor will know about traditional values and know how to talk to the abuser and the victims and the witnesses .
mr. speaker , i think it will be a tremendous help to get the communities going in helping themselves when it comes to family violence .
there are going to be some people at the community level , and also the employees and the counsellors who have to be willing to work hard .
mr. speaker , if we can do that then maybe we can lessen family violence at the community level .
when there is a decrease we will see fewer people in the penitentiaries and the correctional centres and so on .

letter regarding rankin inlet athletes
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker , my statement is regarding the students who went down to iqaluit for a soccer tournament for tryouts for the whitehorse arctic winter games .
principal donald clark received a letter from mindy willet of the kugluktuk team .
the letter states :
&quot; dear hon. manitok thompson , february 8 , 2000 .
i felt compelled to write to you and tell you how impressed i was with the youth from your community and your school .
we played against your boys &apos; team and although they had superior skills they felt no need to blow us away .
they played hard but fair and were excellent sportsmen , even when they didn &apos;t win .
i enjoyed all their company on and off the court .
they were respectful , polite and had a great sense of humour .
obviously , you are setting a good example over there in rankin inlet as a whole community .
your coach was very caring and generous to the boys .
what a role model .
they all respect your community well .
cheers , mindy willet &quot;
here are the soccer boys and their coach .
their coach was eddy sandy he has been volunteering for the last fourteen years for this community .
the players were colin mukphah , johnathan kaludjuak , richard sharpe , nayuk kusugak , moses aupiladjuk , loreen tagoona , adam tanuyak and johnny kapuk .

member &apos;s statement 105 - 1 ( 3 ) :
inuit qaujimajatuqangit
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker , i rise today about our traditional knowledge - inuit qaujimajatuqangit .
on friday i asked a number of questions to the minister of culture , language , elders and youth .
mr. speaker , i would just like to make a further reiteration that before all our elders pass away , we must get from them knowledge on how to maintain traditional values and principles .
we know that only a small number have complete knowledge of hunting skills for example .
we have been given responsibilities .
we have left our families to do our jobs so we cannot pass on our own knowledge to our children .
this is how our ancestors lived and how we coped with the harshness of the weather .
there are a lot of people who know how to go out and read the weather patterns and find out what the weather patterns will be .
there are a lot of people who are striving and i think we should work hard in order to produce and come up with traditional curriculum standards .
i think we have to work immediately .
i realize nunavut tunngavik and other inuit organizations are working and pushing this issue .
so we must push ahead because a lot of elders are passing away quickly and we are losing a lot of their knowledge .
i feel this is a very important issue .
this should be our first priority .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
next time i will remind you again please do not go over your 2 1 / 2 minute limit .
next time i will stop you .

gjoa haven water
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker , i will once again discuss the water reservoir .
we believe this water is not safe for consumption .
though we realize the department is working on this issue , my constituents are concerned about this water situation .
i hope that this problem will resolved as soon as possible .
last week the minister of health and social services stated that he would work in addressing this concern and that the water was safe .
the community government has been consulted and i asked in the legislative assembly about this problem and mr. anawak stated he would deal with this as soon as possible .
he said it would be a first priority concern .
mr. speaker , i told him my concerns and he said they would make a plan to address this problem .
i was very pleased to hear when the minister stated that he would work very closely with us in this very important matter .
mr. speaker , i .

speaker ( interpretation ) : mr. irqittuq is asking for consent from the members to finish his statement .
mr. speaker , i don &apos;t know how this problem will be solved or when the plans or strategy will be put in place .
the way it is i am glad our concerns are being addressed according to our needs .
mr. speaker , this was going to be a first priority and i am pleased they have given me this clarification .

michael savard
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i rise today to recognize a young constituent michael savard , a twelve year old student at aqsarniit school in iqaluit , who was honoured recently by winning a national contest .
michael was the only winner from nunavut in a contest sponsored by the national capital commission called every kids capital contest .
the contest required the submission of a drawing , story or poem .
michael &apos;s won on his colourful drawing which expressed his dream of becoming the best scientist .
this is an impressive achievement because there were a total of 15 thousand entries from all across canada and only thirteen winners .
michael is the son of the proud parents andre savard and robitaille , long time residents of iqaluit .
michael and his whole family just came back from an action packed all expense paid trip to ottawa where they participated in winterlude , ottawa &apos;s annual carnival .
when they arrived they were welcomed by our member of parliament the honourable nancy karatek-lindell at the children &apos;s museum .
at winterlude michael and his family were honoured for his achievement and they were able to view an enlarged copy of his picture displayed on the rideau canal .
while visiting winterlude they were very pleased to see that nunavut was also represented at the ice sculpture competition , where david paniuk and sam pitsiulak were the first participants from nunavut .
michael was presented with a framed copy of his picture and a canadian flag .
the highlight of the trip was going to the house of commons with the other contest winners where they were addressed by , and met with the speaker of the house of commons .
i &apos;m very pleased to congratulate michael and his family for honouring and representing our new territory of nunavut at this national event .
i know members of this assembly will want to join me in congratulating on michael &apos;s achievement and for being an enthusiastic ambassador for nunavut in the nation &apos;s capital .

pressing need for inuit qaujimajatuqangit
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i rise today to talk about an issue that i &apos;ve been concerned about in regards to the elders and the youth of nunavut .
the elders today are decreasing in number and before they are gone we have to pass on inuit qaujimajatuqangit .
we always keep saying that inuit qaujimajatuqangit should be instilled but it is not being practised today .
we must use inuit qaujimajatuqangit because the elders have knowledge about social issues , about survival , about maintenance and about the environment .
before the elders are gone we have to teach the youth about inuit qaujimajatuqangit , which is all encompassing in survival on the land and water .
this is becoming a emergency and i rose today to talk about this issue .

item 6 :
oral questions
question 175 - 1 ( 3 ) :
support for smaller communities
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question is directed to the premier .
last week i asked our premier about the smaller communities .
they should benefit from decentralization .
our premier stated that he would like to see the smaller communities benefit from decentralization and that the nunavut government will not forget the smaller communities .
i was wondering if he is willing to state what the strategy is for the smaller communities .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
as i stated , we are looking for ways of helping the smaller communities .
i met with the minister of sustainable development to plan and strategize for clyde river as to how that community can be given more support .
we will be trying to give all these communities all sorts of support .
that &apos;s the best response i can give you right now mr. speaker .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
have you consulted with the hamlet councils as to what the strategy should be .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. okalik .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
last year the strategy was worked on and i &apos;m sure the hamlet councils were consulted and the communities have to be involved .
that &apos;s the only way we can strategize and it &apos;s not going to be good when we have to work for the community and do the work for the community .
we have to work with the community when we make plans .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. okalik .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
what kind of strategy .
how involved will the community hamlet councils be in the strategy .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
yes perhaps the plan was already given to you , i cannot give you an adequate response so i take your question as notice .
the department of sustainable development will be able to give you a response .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu , he takes your question as notice , so therefore i cannot give you the opportunity to ask another question .
mr. o &apos;brien .
question 176 - 1 ( 3 ) :

mr. irqittuq .
question 177 - 1 ( 3 ) :
payment for grave workers
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
last spring during our session , i think it was towards the end of session , i asked some questions to the minister of community government .
to date i have not received a reply .
during the 1960s , they moved grave sites to another location during the spring time when the ground was pretty wet .
the people who were working on the relocation of these burial sites have never been paid .
i have asked the minister when they will be receiving their pay cheques and i have given them the names of these people .
i was wondering what your position is on that now .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq , who did you direct your question to .
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
mr. speaker , to the minister of justice and community government .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
minister responsible for justice , mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
yes , thank you , mr. speaker .

mr. puqiqnak .
question 178 - 1 ( 3 ) :
taloyoak youth centre
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is directed to the minister of culture , language , elders &amp; youth .
i think that is where my question should be directed in regards to youth and elders .
it is in regards to the community of taloyoak .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
you asked three questions in inuktitut .
i heard three questions .
minister of culture , language , elders &amp; youth , mr. havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
it &apos;s a good question and i am going to try and reply to your concern .
in pond inlet and also cambridge bay and baker lake we organized youth conferences , as you may know .
right now we are trying to look at their concerns and trying to make policies for youth and also for elders .
they are working on it right now and drafting policies , i can &apos;t really do anything until we follow up the kitikmeot and keewatin meetings of elders and youth .
we want to hear their concerns , in a few days they should be finished .
we &apos;ll take a look at it and i will let you know .
thank you , mr. speaker .

hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
i will find out about the costs of decentralization first and then i will give you an answer .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
because culture , language , elders &amp; youth is a new department will they be able to receive funding in order to implement these programs .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
we are undertaking a policy review right now and we are trying to go by our policies .
right now we are going by the old policies from the gnwt and we are upgrading our new policies .
we have to be very careful with these policies that we are developing right now .
all these will be done from the funding we will be receiving from the government .
i already stated earlier that the elders and youth are already at their conference .
we have to make our priorities first and we still have to listen to the young people and the elders because they are working together .
i agree with you , we have to develop these procedures and the policies very carefully , that way they will be more understandable .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. havioyak .

question 179 - 1 ( 3 ) :
health board deficit offset
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr speaker , my question is directed to the minister of finance .
i am wondering , the minister in the article talks about close to a 20 million dollar deficit , this only comes just under 14 million dollars .
i &apos;d like to ask the minister of finance where the remaining funds are going to come to offset that .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr tootoo .
minister of finance , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
we have to confirm those final numbers once we get to the year end .
right now these are preliminary projections based on work with the departments of health and with the three health boards .

mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker i believe in the last session in october one of the members made a recommendation in the house that any surplus funding will go towards housing .
mr. speaker i am wondering if there is going to be an effort to put any of the surplus towards housing .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of finance , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
if my memory is correct , one of the standing committees also directed all unexpended funds going to health board deficits as well , from my recollection .
again , it will be based on the preliminary estimates and the budget will roll out based on the final numbers .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
final supplementary , mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of finance , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
quite frankly , we have to deal with the health board deficit situation as those are ongoing programs that the health boards are delivering .
as we all know , they are finding some difficulties in delivering their programs for whatever reasons .
they are going over budget and we have an obligation to continue to provide services because of the importance of our health care programs .
so , we have to find the funds to deal with that issue and i think all members recognize that .
for an issue such as housing , another equally important initiative and priority i think of all members , it is not an ongoing current year issue .
i mean it more relates to future needs and it would be more adequately addressed in that form in looking at future years &apos; budgets versus current year .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
oral questions .
question 180 - 1 ( 3 ) :
liability for deficits
mr. mclean :
in the february 11 nunatsiaq news document , it stated that there was 8.9 million dollars carried over from 98-99 .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
minister of finance , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
wherever those jurisdictions lay with those , wherever those agencies were based , the surplus or deficit would remain with that jurisdiction effective april 1 .
if it was a nunavut based health board or education board or agency , it would remain with them .
so , that was the agreement that we all signed off on and that took place effective april 1 .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .

mr. mclean :

oral questions . mr. o &apos;brien .
question 181 - 1 ( 3 ) :
approval of funds for deficit
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question to the minister , did the minister put forward to the fmb that the 20 million dollars would be covered under the funding that we dealt with last friday .
was it approved , was it forwarded by the minister of health to the fmb to have this included in the supplementary .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
when you are asking questions to the minister please identify which minister you are referring to .
mr. o &apos;brien , which minister are you referring to .
mr. o &apos;brien :
mr. speaker , i indicated that the question was to the minister responsible for health . speaker :
okay , thank you mr. o &apos;brien . minister responsible for health , mr. picco .
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr speaker , there is no great mystery here as to what has happened with the health and social services boards .
as of march 31 , we had the audits completed for each board as the fiscal year was ending .
that came forward in june and that &apos;s when we knew officially there was an 8.9 million dollar deficit with those three health boards .
eight point nine million dollars plus is our best guesstimate mr. speaker .
right now it &apos;s an additional 11 million dollars .
we won &apos;t know if it &apos;s 11 million dollars , mr. speaker , until after march 31 , 2000 when the three audits will be completed for the three health boards .
at that time we will know the total amount that will come forward .
discussions at the fmb mr. speaker , as you know , are privileged and i am not here to make representation on those discussions .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
oral questions . mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i don &apos;t recall seeing 20 million dollars being put forward last week under the supplementary funding act .
so if it &apos;s been approved i would hope it would come to the members first prior to going to the newspaper .
we may have the money this year .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister responsible for health , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , first of all i can &apos;t make much comment on what the nunatsiaq news reports on any given day .
what i can say to the member is i can &apos;t also guarantee if there &apos;s going to be a deficit within the department of health and social services one year from now .
i am not nostradamus , i can &apos;t tell the future .
and that is the only guarantee i can give to the house .
but i can say mr. speaker , that the money was not spent frivolously , it was spent on needs , services , programs and staff .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
oral questions . mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i agree with the honourable member , i know he &apos;s not a brain surgeon .
my question to the minister , does he have a plan to ensure that next year we can deal with this situation .
does the minister have a plan .
and i guess furthermore as a secondary question mr. speaker , what has caused this 20 million dollar over-expenditure .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
two questions .
minister responsible for health , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
no , mr. speaker , nostradamus was not a brain surgeon .

going to the orders of the day , item 2 .
before we start , i would like to make a few comments .
( interpretation ends ) i remind the ministers to obey rule 36 ( 4 ) , it states ;

minister &apos;s statement 50 - 1 ( 3 ) :
nunavut business incentive policy
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker i am pleased today to inform the house of our progress on the development of a nunavut business incentive policy .
this policy has been worked on for some time involving the departments of executive and intergovernmental affairs , public works and housing , nunavut tunngavik inc. and representatives from the nunavut business community .
i would like to take this time to thank them for their comments and advice to the working group during the consultation period .
much of what they said is reflected within this policy .
i would like to reflect for a moment on what the driving force of this policy is .
this policy meets those criteria .
article 24 reminds us that there must be increased participation and improved capacity of inuit firms to compete for business opportunities and government contracts .
this policy achieves this objective .
similarly in the bathurst mandate , two of the key goals are to encourage self-reliance and to build healthy communities .
the business incentive policy is a vehicle to reach those objectives .
this policy ensures that the residents of nunavut share and benefit from every public dollar spent in this territory .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
( interpretation ends ) much like our land claim , this policy is a living , breathing document .
it is not static . it recognises that to be successful , a policy has to be flexible and responsive to the needs of the people it serves .
in short mr. speaker , the policy is a step forward in meeting the objectives and principals of the nunavut land claim agreement and the bathurst mandate of our government .
( interpretation ) i will be open to hearing any suggestions before we make the final version .
thank you , mr. speaker .

minister &apos;s statement 51 - 1 ( 3 ) :
clarification on fuel price increases
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i rise today in order to clarify the situation with respect to the increased price of fuel , and to assure nunavummiut that we too are concerned .
this is why i rise today .
( interpretation ends ) mr. speaker , i would like to summarise how we arrived at the situation and try to clarify some of the variables .
of course some of the more detailed information will be provided in a proper format to those members who have specific questions .
one of the hardest decisions we &apos;ve had to make recently involved this price increase .
in fact , mr. speaker , as the minister of finance previously stated , the increase was kept to the absolute minimum .
i would like to point out that this is only the second price increase since 1991 .
mr. speaker , i think we have done a good job at holding the prices steady while the market has been going up and down for a number of years .
in order to be able to control price fluctuations , we used a price stabilisation fund with a maximum dollar value of 5 million dollars .
mr. speaker , this means that in a bad year we can , if necessary , absorb losses of up to 5 million dollars without a massive impact on pricing .
unfortunately , even with expenditure reduction in operations &amp; maintenance and capital , the deficit in this fund has been growing steadily .
this is a direct result of trying to hold the line on prices while subsidising all products up to a total of 9.6 million dollars .
mr. speaker , when the costs for this year were totalled , we were faced with having to make a very difficult decision .
every dollar used to subsidise these costs has to be removed from other potential programs .
we were also in danger of exceeding the maximum allowable dollar value in the price stabilisation fund , a maximum of 5 million dollars .
we are not allowed to exceed this maximum amount .
mr. speaker , i would like to provide some information on points of interest .
this allows us to spread the higher costs over all the fuel .
if we calculated the price only on the new fuel received , we would have required a larger increase to cover the cost of only that fuel .
this helped keep the increase as low as possible .
if we were to consider providing any kind of additional subsidies , these additional funds would end up coming from other programs .
this is one of the reasons i had suggested the possibility of assistance for registered hunters through an nti funding program .
mr. speaker , our fuel and transportation costs have risen an average of 33.3 % for the recent sealift season .
we are forced to pass on a percentage of this increase .
we have also experienced a loss as a result of division due to the smaller quantities of fuel we now purchase .
the larger the volume the lower the overall cost .
the decrease in volume as a result of this and other factors was approximately 20 million litres .
finally mr. speaker , in addition to the price subsidies we are already providing , our own costs have risen as we are one of the major consumers of petroleum products through our departments .
this increase has also impacted our operating funds .
mr. speaker , i am very pleased that the members brought this topic forward in this house .
this gives us the opportunity to respond directly to our constituents .
in the future mr. speaker , as indicated by my honourable colleague , the finance minister , we &apos;re completing a review of our entire petroleum products operation .
we will be providing the information to the financial management board in june of 2000 .
mr. speaker , we intend to go even further in order to determine whether there are changes we can make that will help us rein in some of these expenses .
unfortunately we must also be aware that a large part of our cost structure is subject to the same pressure as the rest of the world .
that is the price of oil in our world market .
mr. speaker , i hope this statement helps clarify a few of the many pressures facing the petroleum products division in the area of pricing .
once again , i thank the regular members for highlighting this issue and giving me the chance to respond in a proper forum .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you ms. thompson . mr. akesuk

p-3 update
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
among other things this includes major infrastructure requirements for the government of nunavut such as health care facilities .
mr. speaker , as this assembly is aware , on april 1st of 99 , the government of nunavut inherited four potential health care projects from the gnwt .
new health care facilities were planned for rankin inlet , arviat , iqaluit and cambridge bay .
construction on a new health centre was stopped in august when fuel oil was found to have contaminated the excavation site .
it is expected that it will be completed this november .
mr. speaker , considerable progress has been made with regard of the development of the other three potential health projects .
in may 1999 , the financial management board approved a project to prepare a set of policies and procedures to guide the government in the development , award , and management of p3 projects .
the financial management board also approved an initiative to undertake a separate but related study to evaluate the status quo of the other p3 projects .
the policy and procedures study is virtually complete and a draft of the consultants &apos; report is currently being circulated to the departments of finance and public works for review .
the evaluation study is completed and the government of nunavut departments have reviewed the report .
mr. speaker , the three remaining health care facilities present some challenges .
all three projects were at various stages of the planning process when they were inherited from the gnwt .
mr. speaker , despite these difficulties , the government of nunavut has taken action to ensure that all outstanding issues related to the preliminary planning process are resolved .
in december 1999 , the department of finance and administration re-opened discussions with the sakku investments corporation , qikiqtaaluk corporation and the kitikmeot corporation .
currently the department of finance is finalising the terms and conditions of these contracts with the birthright development corporations .
we hope to have these contracts in place to complete the work within the next two weeks .

tele-medicine mous
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , our honourable premier recently had an opportunity to visit the telemedicine centre of memorial university of newfoundland .
newfoundland and labrador face many problems similar to ours in their efforts to provide health and social services in their province .
they have expressed interest in sharing their experiences in the development and operation of their tetra telemedicine centre with us .
mr. speaker , i am pleased to announce we are in the early stages of developing this mou with memorial university .
queensland , like nunavut , has remote communities with extreme environments .
they have faced many of the challenges we are facing and will share their solutions with us .
this is an exciting opportunity to learn from an existing network in a new and fast paced technology environment .
mr. speaker , as a government committed to the health and wellbeing of our people , it is to our benefit to explore these opportunities and learn from national and international experiences .
i thank the members for their continued support for telehealth in nunavut , and i look forward to apprising the house of developments as these exciting events unfold .

minister &apos;s statement 54 - 1 ( 3 ) :
quarterly municipal funding
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
when we met with municipal leaders and administrators in november 1999 community leaders requested that the government advance its municipal operating contribution on a quarterly basis .
until now municipal contribution funding has been forwarded to hamlets on a monthly basis for a number of reasons .
it was the position of the gnwt that monthly contributions were more effective because among other things it gave the territorial government greater control over many community finances .
last year the new government of nunavut listened to the expectations nunavummiut had for their government .
the result , as you well know , was the bathurst mandate .
mr. speaker the bathurst mandate lays out the principles from which we shall govern .
among these principles are two that i believe are important to the issue of community funding .
the future of healthy communities depends on people being responsible and accountable for their own well being and we &apos;ll work within our means to provide for the needs of our families and communities .
mr. speaker , i would like to announce that communities meeting the departments &apos; financial reporting criteria will be eligible to receive quarterly funding once the main estimates have been approved .
mr. speaker quarterly payments are the best way for helping communities meet the bathurst mandate initiatives for healthy communities and self-reliance .
it will give communities greater authority , responsibility , build capacity and enhance control over their financial well being .
it will make communities more accountable to themselves and it will allow communities a greater opportunity to generate revenue based on the potential they can earn on the advanced funds .
mr. speaker the department of community government and transportation supports quarterly payments as one way in which nunavummiut can take charge of their own affairs and their own futures .

open custody contractors conference
hon. jack anawak :
thank you , mr. speaker .
these facilities will allow low-risk offenders to reside in a less restrictive environment and they aim to help offenders gain skills on the land and become more involved in the communities .
these facilities are an important aspect of our efforts to deal with our offenders , both youth and adults , in a more appropriate and effective way .
it is another way that communities are taking a direct role in justice .
these facilities are run under contract and the contractors are skilled in running their facility .
however they have not had the opportunity to meet as a group to share their professional approaches nor to meet together with department of justice officials to discuss the new procedures for their facility .
mr. speaker , we are therefore holding a three-day conference for open custody contractors in iqaluit this month .
the purpose of the conference is to provide an opportunity for open custody contractors to meet with each other and with corrections staff .
our move to open custody facilities is a significant response to the need to keep low-risk offenders out of jail and to give communities more responsibility in caring and counselling for individuals with problems .

curriculum initiatives
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i &apos;m pleased to announce several curriculum initiatives which will begin to improve the quality of education we are delivering in our school system .
the quality of education is dependent on the quality of curriculum and the resources we provide to deliver courses .
good curriculum ensures better teachers and promotes improved achievement levels .
this mandate requires that we make significant changes not just in what we teach but how we organize schools .
the critical research studies in language and the instruction curriculum resource development strategy will help the early childhood and school services division develop long-term plans to meet the needs of students in nunavut .
however we already know that the existing curriculum has significant gaps .
there is no curriculum for inuktitut , innuinaqtun or second languages .
there is no curriculum about nunavut .
there is no curriculum designed to help our students cope with the rapid changes and significant challenges which they face daily in our communities .
for the last thirty years inuit educators have been promised curriculum and resources for teaching in inuktitut .
the federal government has funded this work yet after thirty years there is very little to show for it .
the other consequence is that our children have been deprived when our teachers are resigning from their work .
they are exposed to a southern school environment at the expense of their history , language and culture .
we know too well the effect de-culturation has had in our communities . we must act , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , we must produce inuktitut resources immediately for our classrooms .
i am pleased to be able to announce that significant work in this area has been accomplished since april 1 , 1999 for the opening of the new school year .
in nunavut we will be able to have curriculum and resources available for all grade levels for inuktitut language arts .
the work is not nearly complete but we have begun .
( interpretation ends ) we require second language curriculum for english , french , inuktitut and innuinaqtun .
development of these curricula is awaiting the recommendation of the language of instruction research .
mr. speaker , in the meantime staff are preparing guidelines and benchmarks for second language courses which will be available to teachers for the new school year .
our children need to learn about their rich heritage and unique environment .
nunavusiutiit will be the social studies curriculum that allows for children to learn about and to take pride in who they are and where they live .
if we do not begin to define nunavut others will do it for us .
we need to be the ones doing the teaching , both for ourselves and for students outside nunavut .
inuqataginiq is another new curriculum that will help address these needs .
so many of our students are at immediate risk that the need for a course that will help them develop skills , capacity and strong collective cultural identity is critical .
( interpretation ) mr. speaker , although we have many other projects on the go , i want to focus on the three that are most essential .
these three areas have been identified as high priorities for ecnss , however we also face significant funding issues .
curriculum design and development is a long and costly process .
we require extensive collaboration with elders , resource people , school-based educators , students and parents if we are going to do the job properly .
we must field-test new curricula , develop assessment tools , design guidelines and in-service workshops for teachers , identify and produce resource materials to accompany the curriculum document .
( interpretation ends ) printing documents and distributing them to schools is an additional cost .
ecnss has no actual budget for any of this work .
we will be looking for funding and support for curriculum development so our students and inuit educators finally receive the support and the resources and the leadership they deserve .

hall beach school addition
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i will make sure that i speak within the time limit .
mr. speaker , last week i asked the minister of education about the school addition in hall beach .
the minister answered that this project has been delayed and the needs had to be considered along with all the other needs in nunavut .
mr. speaker , i have learned that the plans were well advanced in the past , over a year ago community consultations took place and an architect began on the plans for an addition .
i &apos;m told that the drawings were three quarters of the way to being finished .
when the project was stopped , it is my understanding that all the projects were stopped by the new government .
the only projects that were allowed to continue were projects where the work had already started .
projects where contracts had been issued to a contractor to start site work or building or where there were serious health and safety considerations .
mr. speaker , the arnaqjuaq school in hall beach was built for kindergarten to grade 9 .
since it was built we are offering up to grade 12 in hall beach , but the school was not built with that in mind . it has only eight classrooms .
this fall there were 214 students in that school , ten more than last year .
mr. speaker , the school is full and the principal tells me that they are having to hold classes in the library .
the new grade 10 to 12 programs are taking up space that was meant for the kindergarten to grade 9 program , mr speaker ...

the new grade 10 to 12 programs are taking up space that was meant for the kindergarten to grade 9 program .
mr speaker , the minister has said that he will be developing a capital plan for education this coming year .
i &apos;m urging the minister to put a high priority on the projects like the hall beach school addition where planning was well underway .
where the design was almost complete and where there was a strong need . thank you mr. speaker .

suicides in nunavut
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
here in nunavut our life has changed .
our society has changed drastically and we have felt the effects back in the 1970s and after the 70s a number of young people , mostly men , have committed suicide .
we would ask the different organizations that had certain responsibilities or delegate some other organization to look into this suicide issue .
but since the 70s to now there &apos;s over 400 suicides .
if we are looking at the statistics , one small community has been wiped out by looking at the statistics .
so , that wipes out one classroom , that &apos;s an example .
they &apos;re all over nunavut and i think the community leaders should perhaps address this issue more aggressively in order to help their young people .
i would urge the leadership to be more sensitive to the young people in their communities as to how they should address this very serious problem of suicide .
i thank you very much mr. speaker .

mr. tootoo .
member &apos;s statement 114 - 1 ( 3 ) :
inadequate education funding
mr. tootoo :
mr. speaker i rise today to express my strong concern about the reduced funding for education .
yesterday , a class of grade 5 students at nakasuk school in iqaluit had to be cancelled because no substitute teacher was available .
in nakasuk school in iqaluit , for example , the school is projecting an average class size of 31 for inuktitut programs unless there is some relief .
these pressures of class size are taking their toll on our teachers as well .
i know of several qualified teachers in iqaluit who have left their crowded classrooms to take office jobs with the government of nunavut , in much less stressful situations .
the loss of even one trained inuit teacher is a tragic setback for the goals we all support of enhancing the inuktitut language and culture in our education system .
i am wondering if we need to consider providing financial incentives to teachers as we did to the nurses in nunavut earlier this year .
the pressures are not just in classrooms , our schools are very short of money for materials and supplies .
this year there are 1,050 students in iqaluit , but under the current formula , the funding formula provides them with only 49.5 teachers .
schools in iqaluit in the coming year , because of the growth in enrolment , will be short approximately 1.5 million dollars just to keep the same level of service as this year .
mr. speaker , in recent news reports the minister of finance talks about a sizeable budget surplus for this fiscal year .
today , on cbc radio , i heard him say that preliminary estimates indicate that the surplus could be between 30 and 40 million dollars .
the government of nunavut has said that education and housing are two of its main priorities .
i look forward to seeing these stated priorities reflected in concrete action .

canada / nunavut language agreement
mr. akesuk :

my question is for the minister of culture , language , elders &amp; youth .
earlier this year both the yukon and nwt signed an agreement with the federal government to secure funds for the preservation and enhancement of aboriginal languages .
could the minister inform the house as to the status of the canada / nunavut agreement .

we will be focusing on french language , inuinnaqtun language and the inuktitut language .

question 183 - 1 ( 3 ) :
federal gun legislation
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question , which i brought up in october , will be directed again to minister of justice in regards to the gun legislation .
possibly what i can do is provide a preamble .
we the inuit had a tradition where guns were used to provide food on the table and for survival .
the gun legislation of today is totally against our traditional life style .
i asked this question to the minister in october and he said that he would take this as notice and provide us with the information at a later date .
mr. minister could you provide the information that you were going to provide us .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kattuk .
minister of justice , mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
i &apos;m not quite sure what the question is but what i can say is this is not the responsibility of the nunavut government .
there was no agreement signed between the two governments .
the federal government , through the use of the rcmp is working on the gun control legislation and they had a community tour but i had no opportunity to meet with that person .
i apologize and i don &apos;t know exactly what came about in regards to gun control regulations .
there were going to be community consultations and i apologize that i could not have a meeting with that person .
possibly what i could do is get in touch with that person and give you the information afterwards .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
oral questions .
mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :

the reason i &apos;m asking this question is because in october i believe you made a statement saying that you would have a meeting with the minister in ottawa .

thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr kattuk .

hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :

speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister anawak .
mr. kattuk .

speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kattuk .
minister of justice , mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
i believe that this was going to be one of the questions that would be posed to the person when he was doing his community tours .
i will make that one of the questions when i talk to them .
he was going to be talking to the people of nunavut about the fees and so on .

thank you mr. anawak .
mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
again in our ridings there are a lot of people out there who don &apos;t know about the gun control regulations and the legislation .
what is this 25 dollar fee used for .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kattuk .
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
the 25 dollar fee is used for the administration done by the retailers or whoever is administering the process .
it doesn &apos;t have anything to do with the government , it &apos;s an administrative fee charged by the retail outlets .

my second question to mr. okalik is , can you give me a time frame that i can relate back to the people of my community so that i can have an idea .
when do we expect the accommodations to be ready or found .

question 185 - 1 ( 3 ) :
ntpc cut-off process
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question will probably come out in two parts mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i have a question for the minister responsible for ntpc .
i believe there &apos;s a rule or regulation coming from the ntpc where after 48 hours late payment their power will be cut off .
looking at the north and extreme conditions it &apos;s very , very serious if the water pipes break because the costs go way up .
is the minister going to be making a change to that 48 hour late payment cut off .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister responsible for the power corporation , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i appreciate the question so we can clarify the situation around that notice .
what happens mr. speaker , is the notice is sent out from headquarters in hay river and it still gives the consumer or the customer six weeks to pay .
on that notice it says if it &apos;s not paid in a certain amount of time their power will be cut off .
as we know mr. speaker , we do not cut peoples &apos; power off in december or january when it &apos;s 40 below .
so there are options mr. speaker , available to the customer after they receive that notification . thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
oral questions .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker . it &apos;s probably like that from your vantage point but when you &apos;re at the community level it &apos;s different .
will your headquarters employees follow through with the orders and all that you have mentioned .
when the bill finally arrives into the community , it &apos;s already overdue .
is there something you can do mr. minister .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , just give me an opportunity to maybe clarify the situation .
you have that opportunity to do that before any power is cut off .
it &apos;s not that you receive the bill in the mail and then the power is cut off .
so there are considerable opportunities to do that .
after saying that mr. speaker , the nwt power corporation is a crown corporation . we have 33 % ownership as the members know .
the nwt government has the rest , 67 % of the ownership of the power corporation and this is a business decision made by the power corporation .
it is not a decision made by this government .

mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :

speaker :
minister responsible for the power corporation , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , the staff have already been consulted on the way to deal with arrears on people &apos;s accounts .
there is a format in place to deal with that .
that has been there before this notice came up .
that was not a decision made by the government of nunavut , that was a decision made by the corporation itself , at its hay river head office .

question 188 - 1 ( 3 ) :
polar bear hunting regulations
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to ask a question of the minister responsible for sustainable development .
when there are polar bear defence kills or if a female with cubs is killed the disposal of the hide is the responsibility of the hunters and trappers .
in my community of taloyoak , there are now two polar bear hides as a result of these types of situations .
unfortunately these hides cannot be sold .
i &apos;m wondering if the government would be willing to look at the regulations and policies regarding these situations .
speaker :
thank you .
minister of sustainable development .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i believe he is asking if we are going to be reviewing the policies .
we agreed in the past and we made this announcement about the hunters and trappers regulations and policies within our department .
the hunters and trappers in the communities and the sustainable development department have an agreement in regards to dealing with polar bears .
the policy that you have just questioned has been reviewed and once we have consulted other communities , then we will review the other policies that affect all the communities in nunavut .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kilabuk .
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker . the minister of sustainable development had mentioned that they will be reviewing these policies and consulting the communities .
we do not wish to put our traditional and cultural knowledge aside .
we want to enhance our skills .
would the minister be willing to review all the traditional skills once the policies and regulations have been reviewed .
how will you be consulting the communities .
if you can give me an answer .

can the minister of health tell me what is the total cost of medical travel in nunavut this year .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
minister responsible for health , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i can &apos;t give him the actual cost for this year because this year is not finished yet .
this year won &apos;t get finished until march 31st but what i can say is that approximately 20 % of the health boards &apos; budgets go toward the expense of medical travel .
our best guess at the present time is that should be around 20 million dollars .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .

minister responsible for health , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker , as the member knows right now , we still have all our health boards in place until april 1st .
they are doing the arrangements .
for example , the baffin regional health and social services board has worked out an agreement with first air .
they are doing some agreements like that .

question 193 - 1 ( 3 ) :
extra funding for housing authorities
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i have a question for the minister of housing .
my question is , mr. speaker , the housing associations in the communities have limited funds and they always encounter this problem each year and some community members are in arrears .
they are in arrears because some of them aren &apos;t employed and mr. speaker , it is difficult to collect rent from people who are having trouble finding jobs .
my question to the minister , has the minister been able to find extra funds to help local housing authorities with operations and maintenance in the current year .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .

minister responsible for housing , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :

as i said earlier mr. speaker , once we start on this item of the budget then we can address this issue at that meeting .
i am aware that there are some funding problems in the communities and i am also aware that there are some issues that have to be addressed by the housing associations .
but , as i said earlier , i will submit options during the budget session , so at this point i can &apos;t really make any statements on this issue until later mr. speaker .

mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
is he concerned about that .
i guess my concern is that does the minister feel that was prudent on his part to release this information prior to us getting to the budget process .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister of finance , hon. kelvin ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , one has to recognize that as i indicated , this is one time , 1999-2000 unexpended funds .
the primary reason , as members know , is the fact that we are at about 75 % staff at this point , so there are significant under-expenditures in those areas throughout government .
that situation will rapidly change given that we are constantly filling positions and expect to be at higher levels of staffing for the 2000-2001 year .
ideally we would be at a 90 % -95 % level , which is probably a historical operating level of government in respect to staffing .
so , i think it is important to recognize that . i &apos;m sure that our union friends are undergoing collective agreement negotiations now with our government and i understand that situation as well .
otherwise we would operate in a deficit situation , and i don &apos;t think any members of this house would want to operate under those conditions mr. speaker .

item 11 :
replies to opening address
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
mr. speaker , i am going to read my reply to the commissioner &apos;s opening address .
mr. speaker , i am very pleased to reply to the commissioner &apos;s address .
i would like to tell my constituents what i have been doing as their mla since i was fortunate to be elected about one year ago .
first i want to point out some very important needs in my community of pond inlet .
these needs are for new buildings .
the needs in our communities are urgent .
i think this is partly because when nunavut was created on april 1 , 1999 , the new nunavut government took over from the old northwest territories government .
we were very happy to see the creation of nunavut ;
however , the way we see it when the new government took over from the northwest territories government the capital planning process was interrupted .
under the gnwt , the hamlet of pond inlet worked very hard on a five-year capital plan .
we were very familiar with the five-year capital plan ;
it seemed that as we prepared for nunavut , the five-year plan was forgotten by the gnwt .
then when the nunavut government took over , it seemed that the planning started all over again .
some important projects got delayed or forgotten .
this year &apos;s budget was not really the budget of the government of nunavut .
it is only a budget for one year .
the minister of finance has said that we will only be able to work on a five-year capital plan after we have finished the budget for this coming year .
so the long-term plan , the five-year capital planning process was interrupted when we moved from one government to another .
a very good example is our takijualuk school , the school got so run down that it had to be closed .
other buildings that are suffering from neglect are the community hall , the arena and the health centre .
although these buildings have not had to close down yet , they may not last very long .
something has to be done very soon .
community hall ;
the community hall was built in 1977 , it is now older than half the population of pond inlet .
the insulation in the building is very thin and some parts of the walls are not insulated at all .
the situation is so bad that every winter if we have enough snow , we insulate the outside of the building with snow to help with the heating .
the building was renovated about 12 years ago , but those renovations were only done on the outside of the building .
inside the building , the person who was doing the renovations pointed out that there was a very serious problem with the roof .
every spring , there have been serious leaks in the roof when it starts to melt .
these leaks have meant that there is hardly any insulation in the roof .
mr. speaker , this is a very important building in our community , this is the only place where children and young people can come to play freely .
the community has a strict rule against drugs or alcohol in the building , so our young people , our young children feel comfortable and welcome in this place .
young people are in this building all the time , this is where they gather for dances or to play games such as pool , table tennis or video games .
this building keeps many of our young people from getting into trouble .
this is the only place where the nunavut court of justice can have court .
mr. speaker , this very important building is falling apart .
the mayor has told me that the hamlet spends so much time and money fixing this very old building , sometimes he just feels like giving up and closing the building down .
the terrible thought of having no place for our young people stops him from closing the building down .
the hamlet is very concerned with the huge amount of money they are spending to keep the building open .
these costs are putting a lot of pressure on the hamlet budget .
the money is being spent on keeping the building repaired and causing other hamlet programs to suffer .
the mayor is also worried that the problem with the electricity and the sewage tanks mean that the building might be found to be unsafe or unhealthy .
arena ;
our arena was one of the first arenas built when the government of nwt started building arenas in communities .
the pond inlet arena was built as a pilot project .
unfortunately , it was not a full size arena and we as a larger community are entitled to a full size hockey rink .
government officials have told us that we are entitled to a full size arena .
right now , having a small arena means that we can &apos;t ever host hockey tournaments .
if our hockey teams want to play in tournaments they always have to travel to other communities .
if we participate in regional games , we always travel to other communities .
we can never host tournaments or regional competitions .
our old arena is also very poorly insulated so the building is very cold .
my constituents are very concerned that it is not good for people to be breathing in such cold air .
while they &apos;re skating , it is not good for people to be sweating in such cold air .
this would meet our very pressing needs for a proper community hall and arena and it would also save money .
it should cost much less to combine these needs for planning and construction rather than building two separate facilities .
new health centre ;
our community has been fortunate to have a resident doctor and her family move in last fall .
we were very pleased to welcome dr. demaio to our community and we would like to tell the minister of health and social services this is very much appreciated .
i would like to point out that the new doctor does not only serve the residents of pond inlet , she also visits other north baffin communities from her base in pond inlet .
we are concerned , however , that our health centre is old and too small for a growing population .
the health centre will be under even more pressure when new jobs for government are received and more families are put in place in pond inlet .
mr. anawak , the minister of community government and transportation , and the minister of finance have been told of our pressing capital needs .
we are very hopeful that these needs will be reflected in the coming year &apos;s budget and built into the government of nunavut five-year plan .
mr. speaker , i thank you for the opportunity to explain these needs to my fellow mlas and the people of tunnuniqmiut through this reply to the commissioners address .
taima .

you made a very good recommendation .
we will move that to tomorrow &apos;s schedule .
we have two other items .
mr. minister you can make your opening comments now and submit the report tomorrow .
please proceed .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman it gives me great pleasure today to begin the opening comments on the ikuma report .
the ikuma report was commissioned to look at various options available to the nunavut government to provide electrical power to nunavummiut .
the two main parts of the report describe :
the possible structures for a nunavut power corporation with an analysis of the pros and cons of each structure ;
general policy and regulatory issues associated with power rates and subsidies that must by decided by the people and the government of nunavut .
that &apos;s us mr. chairman .
in regards to the actual structure the ikuma report favours the crown corporation model for a number of reasons .
those reasons are , mr. chairman :
simplicity - it already exists in legislation - we have it on papermore flexibility - it can create its own policies to meet business needs rather than being limited to general government policy .
something like we are seeing with the situation in clyde river today .
with the possible rate increase that you have brought up mr. chairman and articulated very well in this assembly .
mr. chairman , the report does not provide specific recommendations about a number of questions , many of which , will be the subject of the next phase or implementation work .
some of these questions are :
- how much capacity can the nunavut power corporation develop between
now and april 1 , 2001
there are others such as wind and solar technology , fuel , fuel cell technology , as well as , heat recovery initiatives that increase efficiency of current diesel operations .
mr. chairman as we consider these options we must look twenty to thirty years into the future .
mr. chairman we will need to consider and answer these questions and more during this transition period .
now the next phase , mr. chairman , in establishing the nunavut &apos;s own power corporation has already begun .
indeed , mr. chairman it had not been advertised in the south either .
we followed up on that recommendation from the standing committee .
the president &apos;s position is currently being advertised and it is anticipated that someone will be in place by early april .
i anticipate , mr. chairman , that we will have preliminary recommendations on some immediate operational issues raised in this report within the next eight to ten weeks .
these recommendations will provide some insight into the number of headquarters jobs that could be established .
where these headquarter jobs will be located and the level of outsourcing , mr. chairman , which is the key issue here - outsourcing that we will require in order to best serve nunavut .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
there is not enough time today to get into any other matters , can i have a motion to report progress .
mr. premier . hon. paul okalik :
mr. chairman i move that we report progress .
chairperson ( interpretation ) : motion is in order .

point of privilege
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker i rise today on a point of privilege .
mr. speaker , a reporter for the rankin inlet bureau of the cbc radio inaccurately represented yesterday &apos;s question period , during this morning &apos;s news broadcast .
specifically , this reporter in her news story reported that five members of this assembly questioned me on the estimated budget surplus .
mr. speaker , i would like to clarify to my honourable colleagues that only two members of this assembly questioned me on this very important matter .
furthermore this reporter stated , and i quote , &quot; many were upset that they hadn &apos;t heard about the size of the surplus earlier &quot; unquote .
mr. speaker , my colleagues will recall the subject of an estimated surplus was disclosed to my colleagues earlier this month .
during yesterday &apos;s question period my honourable colleague for arviat accurately noted this fact .
however mr. speaker , the cbc reporter failed to reflect this accuracy in her story , but chose instead to report that members had not previously been informed of this matter .
mr. speaker , the notion that my colleagues were frustrated and upset by this does not in any way accurately reflect the proceedings of this chamber .
mr. speaker , when media misrepresents the proceedings of this house it is something that all members of the house should be concerned about .
it is a violation of parliamentary privilege that all members of this assembly take seriously .
it is only in the best interests of this assembly to have accurate representations of its proceedings .
thank you , mr. speaker .
&gt; &gt; &gt; applause
speaker :
thank you mr. ng for your point of privilege .
as members of this house are aware , the fact that we are sitting in rankin inlet has resulted in the delay of the usual practice of producing the hansard blues the next day .
when the blues are received we will review them and report back to this house in a timely fashion .
before we proceed to the orders of the day , i would like to give special recognition to anthony maningnaluk , the sergeant at arms for the remaining portion of this sitting .
mr. maningnaluk has served the canadian rangers since 1992 and we are pleased to have him here with us today .
we are also pleased to welcome our new pages from the alaittuq high school ;
they are silu ittinuar , charlotte kusugak , tamora nahangululik , david niveatsuk , pam pilakapsi and william tiktak .
&gt; &gt; &gt; applause
speaker :
to ensure the hansard is correct , mr. maningnaluk has served the canadian rangers since 1942 .

federation of nunavut teachers negotiations
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , it gives me great pleasure to rise to update my colleagues on the latest developments of our efforts to conclude an agreement with the federation of nunavut teachers .
late monday night mr. speaker , the negotiating teams of both the nunavut government and the federation of nunavut teachers reached an agreement for the fnt membership to ratify .
if ratified , teachers across nunavut will benefit from salary increases of 3.5 percent effective september of 1999 and a 2.75 percent increase effective september 2000 , and another 2.75 increase effective september 2001 .
in addition , the union membership will benefit from a one time professional allowance .
this one time payment recognizes the value our government places on the important role that teachers play in our communities and in our classrooms .
mr. speaker , members of this house acknowledge that it is very important for this agreement to be ratified .
with this in mind it has been agreed that specific details of the tentative agreement will not be released until after ratification .

municipal health &amp; social services committees
hon. ed picco :
in a few weeks , on april 1 , 2000 , the operations of the health and social services boards will become part of the department of health .
the reason for this integration mr. speaker , is reflected in the bathurst mandate . in particular the themes of simplicity , unity and building healthy communities .
a tremendous amount of planning work has gone into the first part of the integration , which is primarily administrative .
staff from all three regions and headquarters have been working together to design health and social services as a single organization .
mr. speaker , although we officially integrate on april 1 , the bulk of work is still in front of us .
we are seeking to establish strong relations between the minister and communities and this is our goal .
we want to build an effective , sustainable system that is both clinically sound and consistent with the values and knowledge of nunavummiut .
we are determined to put our efforts into a new partnership between the department and nunavut communities .
the response has been very positive and i expect that most if not all communities in nunavut will soon have established these committees .
these committees will facilitate discussion in their communities and between their communities and the department of health about their own community &apos;s priorities .
they will also be able to work with us to make the best use of resources on behalf of nunavummiut .
these discussions will be critical in determining how we will structure the system in the future ;
what role communities may play and how they may organise themselves to do it , and how we should organize the department to make it work best .
my department will support the work of committees with a financial contribution as well as information and orientation .
our regional staff will be dedicated to helping communities build up their own capacity .
mr. speaker , this working relationship with communities will form a major contribution to the reform of programs and services , which is the final goal of integration .
like every other jurisdiction in canada , it becomes more and more challenging to maintain the same level of service that we enjoy today , let alone improving it .
mr. speaker , as you can see , we are making progress towards making our health and social services system a made in nunavut one .
i look forward to providing further updates to the members in the coming sessions .

early childhood &amp; school services workshop
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. speaker , i wish to share with members of the legislature an important workshop hosted by our early childhood and school services division in arviat , from february 1 to 3 , 2000 .
the workshop began with the process of creating a strong team , one that can work together and be creative , productive for the benefit of nunavut students .
facilitated by jose kusugak the team tackled the critical issues facing education in nunavut .
over the three days the team worked to develop common aims , a vision and action plans .
the workshop produced a set of priorities and action plans .
key are structural changes such as revising staffing policy to ensure that elders and knowledgeable resource people are able to be employed by schools .
the implementation of inuit qaujimajatuqangit should be preceded by the development of strategy .
we will move into the restructuring strategy carefully , initiating plans first through selected schools in nunavut as a pilot project .
this workshop marked a very strong and positive step to the work that will be done to reshape nunavut schools .

summaries of nunavut statutes
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. speaker , i am glad to speak about justice and the improvements for justice .
the laws and regulations have been summarised and a document showing the terms and terminology of justice has been completed .
the summaries are an important resource for inuit who want to understand nunavut &apos;s laws in their own language .
this the first time such a project has been undertaken in canada and perhaps the first time in the world .
this month the summaries are being distributed to the public libraries throughout nunavut as well as the members of the legislative assembly .
the summaries have already been distributed to the members of maligarnit qimmirrujiit .
electronic versions will also be made available to the nunavut court of justice library website .
the department of justice will be updating the summaries and translations as the laws of nunavut are changed and in this way the summaries will continue to be useful .
i am pleased that the nunavut department of justice has undertaken this initiative .
it is another way in which we are attempting to make justice accessible to all nunavummiut .

recognition of author simon tookoome
mr. mclean :
thank you , mr. speaker .
today i rise with great pride to deliver a member &apos;s statement about simon tookoome .
mr. speaker , a book was placed in front of you today .
it is simon tookoome &apos;s first book as an author , titled , &quot; the shaman &apos;s nephew &quot; .
mr. speaker , i will read parts of the introduction .
simon tookoome was one of the last inuit to live the traditional nomadic life in the far north .
tookoome , as he prefers to be known , resisted government efforts to make him leave the land .
he continued to follow the caribou and seals , feeding and clothing his family from the land .
however , even he was compelled to join the rest of his people and he now lives in baker lake .
nevertheless he has kept his sled dogs and continues to hunt and feed his family .
he has also kept his language and only speaks inuktitut .
the world knows him as an artist whose works are shown internationally and his art graces a canadian stamp .
tookoome is a leading artist from a generation of great inuit artists .
remarkably the inuit had never before created art .
they did not even have a word for it .
the art developed during their time of great change as they entered the modern world .
for some , art was a product to sell but for others like tookoome it was also a way to express an ancient way of living and seeing .
so tookoome has produced a body of art that is strange and wonderful .
his story is equally strange and wonderful .
so i would encourage us all to read this mr. speaker .
thank you , mr. speaker .

travel to ittuarturvik
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i really enjoyed mr. mclean &apos;s member &apos;s statement .
mr. speaker , there is a very special area near taloyoak which has great importance to our residents .
this place , which is called ittuarturvik , is cherished by our residents both as a traditional settlement of their ancestors and also as a place of beauty rich in natural resources .
my constituents tell me that this place has more wildlife in greater numbers than taloyoak including marine mammals such as ujjuk &apos;s , and whales .
in english this place is known as lord mayor bay .
inuit from taloyoak last lived there about 25 or 30 years ago , there is still an old mission building there .
at one point their boats have to be taken on the land along a difficult section of the river then to the ocean .
to portage their boats a trailer is needed .
for years , community residents have used a small trailer , which was once owned by department of sustainable development .

you can continue mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the trailer was written off as surplus by the department of sustainable development years ago it is quite old and is now wearing out .
last summer , the trailer broke down on the trail i described .
i would like the minister of the department of sustainable development to help my community to avoid this kind of problem in the future .
i hope it will be possible for the minister to identify minor capital funds from his department in the coming year so this old trailer could be replaced .
mr. speaker , this is not a huge capital project but it could mean a great deal to the residents of my community .
helping them to regain to their links to their past at this beautiful dwelling place of their ancestors .

hunting killer whales
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :

i will watch my time .
last summer in my community we saw bowhead whales .
bowhead whales were observed and there were more than one and these bowhead whales were dead .
i &apos;m sure they were killed by killer whales and afterwards when i went to iqaluit there were three more found dead which were killed by killer whales .
the bowheads , the skin of the bowheads which have muktaaq , the inuit people took the best of the muktaaq for consumption .
mr. speaker , the killer whales are now killing the mammals in the oceans of nunavut , if possible , we would like to see the killer whales being harvested when they are seen .
again i will be asking a question about this issue during question period .

in the grade 7 class , first place went to jerry horlick for an interesting project dealing with the effects of cold on motor oil .
mr. speaker , these projects were by grade 6 students .
not to be outdone , the grade 7 students turned in winners also .
the effects of smoking by heda jeffrey and kylie mark and a very , very interesting project by lindsay lloyd and lorraine tieman called the &quot; perfect glove &quot; .
mr. speaker , having judged several of these science fairs over the last two years , i know first hand the hard work and dedication students and indeed parents put in to these projects .
mr. speaker , aqsarniit school is in its first year of operation and already school pride and school spirit is very much a part of the school atmosphere .

thank you , mr. speaker .
this project is having some problems .
this project is a business venture , aqaumajuq fisheries , which is the business arm of the broughton island hunter &apos;s and trapper &apos;s organization .
four of my constituents in broughton island have been working on this business for clams and selling them in south baffin communities .
four of my constituents were given training in diving and safety procedures .
we are very happy to be involved in this growing new business in diving for clams and selling them in pangnirtung and iqaluit .
we even dive for clams in the winter through ice .
i know there is a good market for clams , especially in winter .
this new business should grow and succeed .
i was very pleased that they were trained with the help of sustainable development and the kakivak association .
i also understand that safety procedures were developed and are being followed .
i also understand that their diving equipment has been maintained and kept in good condition with assistance of the department of sustainable development .
i apologize today , i will ask you to excuse me , mr. speaker , i have been having problems with my nose all day .

support for inuit cultural institute
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
although i have spoken about this since we arrived here , we &apos;re quite proud to see the sergeant-at-arms .
you see the kayak right in the middle of the floor there , it was made by the husband of the previous sergeant-at-arms who is ollie ittinnuar .
i just wanted to point out how hard she has worked and how hard mr. ittinnuar has worked preserving the culture and traditions of inuit .
he has worked very hard on traditional hunting and i &apos;m sure you have heard that he has been involved with the icc , inuit culture institute , to preserve inuit cultures and traditions .
we have to recognize these people for all their work .
at this point , although the inuit cultural institute still exists , they have been lacking funding , but currently they have been compiling and recording legends .
mr. ollie ittinuar has also been the icc chairperson and has documented inuit traditions and values .
although we recognize his work , we should be more respectful and we should give him more recognition of all his work .
sometimes , when they work together i know they have disagreements , and due to disagreements there is no working collaboration going on .
i know that mr. ittinnuar values inuit traditions .
i just wanted to state that .

mr. speaker , this is an important project for my constituency and for the four men who are supplementing their income through this project .

when we arrived in whale cove everything was scheduled and prepared and lots of people were waiting for our arrival .
they were prepared and waiting for us .
they &apos;re prepared for us to visit them , no matter which community it is , the smaller communities are anxious to meet with us and waiting for us with open arms .
in the future we should visit and tour the smaller communities more often so they can recognize us as members of the legislature and we can be closer to the people of nunavut .
for that reason , i stand up to speak about this issue , and i was proud to see the premier and the speaker going with us along with the mla for whale cove .
i also would like to thank my colleagues for going over there .
looking at the inuit people when we arrived there , when i saw their faces , i could see that they were happy to see us and it showed physically .
so , they finally saw what they have been expecting for such a long time .
they were not just dreaming or visualising seeing the mlas , they actually saw us physically .

resolution island clean-up
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , about 310 kilometres south of my constituency lies resolution island .
this island has earned the dubious reputation of being the most contaminated military sight in the north .
i think that island is in my colleague mr. picco &apos;s constituency , however i won &apos;t hold him responsible for that .
the concentrations of pcbs on resolution island have been found to be up to 160 times higher than the canadian environmental laws permit .
mr. speaker , the good news is that the site is being cleaned up through a five-year plan of the department of indian affairs and northern development .
the even better news is that the work to clean up this remote sight is being done by our own qikiqtaaluk corporation , the development arm of the qikiqtaaluk inuit association .
i want to say how pleased i am that qc has been entrusted with this responsibility by diand .
first of all , they are employing and training a great crew of inuit from iqaluit and other baffin communities who have worked on this site for the past two years .
so far , 13 million dollars have been spent at this site .
a very large part of this money has stayed in the north due to the enlightened approach taken by diand by contracting qc to do the work .
qc has ensured that any employment and benefits have been maximized .
on top of that qc is doing a very good job .
mr. speaker , recently the resolution island senior management team reviewed last year &apos;s performance .
he is quoted as saying &quot; everyone is viewing last year as a major success for what was done on the island &quot; , said mr. mitchell .
mr. speaker , so far the contaminated soil has been cleaned , stock piled and put into containers .
the next step will be up to the nunavut impact review board .
the board will have to decide whether the soil can be treated and cleaned up on site or whether it should be shipped south to be cleaned ...

oral questions . mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker . i don &apos;t mean to beat a dead horse here .
we &apos;re a little short on questions here today so i will stay on this line of questioning .
part of the projected deficit of the three health boards was 8.9 million dollars from , i believe , over the last year and a half . two years .
can the minister tell me whether this 8.9 million dollars has actually been spent . thank you , mr. speaker .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
oral question , mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
could the minister further clarify this issue of the 8.9 million dollars .
this amount has been committed or spent , however you want to phrase it .
this may be only semantics .
if that is the case , why was it not put into the supplementary appropriation that we did last week here .
we debated it and passed it and i remember asking if there were more looming financial matters on the horizon that we &apos;d have to deal with .
i believe the answer that i got was that it was hard to predict if we may have larger amounts that we &apos;d have to bring another sup forward for .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister of finance , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
five point two i believe is the actual figure from the department of health , unexpended funds to be allocated to the regional health boards .
so the matter of the 8.9 million dollars as i indicated earlier on the actual financial treatment of that hasn &apos;t been finalised yet .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .

question 199 - 1 ( 3 ) :
stop work order on aqaumajuq fisheries
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question is to the minister responsible for the workers &apos; compensation board .
on february 21st , 2000 , a safety officer for the wcb issued a stop work order to four of my constituents who were diving for clams .
the stop work order is in english only and does not give the reasons why the work was stopped .
my question to the minister , could the minister explain why the order was issued .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
it doesn &apos;t state whether it was in respect to a safety issue surrounding the employees or whether it was in respect to possible deficiencies by the employer .
but i will commit to following up with the wcb to get more details on this particular circumstance .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .

mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :

mr. speaker , supplementary question .
i understand that the wcb has the responsibility for enforcing safety in the work place .
i would like to ask the minister , does the wcb also have a mandate to assist workers and businesses to make their work places safer .
thank you , mr. speaker .
hon. kelvin ng :
mr. speaker , i believe that the compensation board does have a workers &apos; safety division within their realm of responsibility .

mr. tootoo :

mr. speaker , i &apos;m afraid i don &apos;t understand the minister &apos;s response , the minister indicated that she had ...

speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
perhaps if i can speak inuktitut you would be able to understand .
quite often the media misquote the members and it is something that happens quite often .
they have to make their money .
my responses , my staff know what they are supposed to do and they know that they should work openly .
so that is my response .
speaker :
thank you ms. thompson mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :

so if i understand the minister correctly , she is indicating that she gave no direction at any time for her staff to slough off any possible interview on this topic .

question 203 - 1 ( 3 ) :
manitoba presentation on pre-feasibility study
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , this is not a question related to the media or cbc , nor nunatsiaq news but they sure make things interesting .
mr. speaker , my question is directed to the minister responsible for the power corporation .
mr. speaker , on friday past i posed a question in reference to the recent pre-feasibility study that has been completed regarding the possibility of a power grid between manitoba and the keewatin .
the minister indicated that given the fact that there was a delegation coming here from manitoba this week , basically that he would wait to comment on it at that time .
mr. speaker , the delegation did come , they did make a presentation .
unfortunately i don &apos;t believe that there was anybody from the executive side of the table , from cabinet , at that presentation .
there were regular members at it and it was a very interesting and detailed report .
maybe he had an opportunity to speak to some of the staff after this presentation .
thank you .
speaker :
mr. o &apos;brien , i am asking you to rephrase your question .
you cannot ask the minister how he feels .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i will rephrase my question and i do hope the minister is feeling well .
after all he is the minister of health .
the minister i would assume has had an opportunity to review some of this information and i would like to know what he feels is the next step in this process .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister responsible for the power corporation , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
i am feeling fine , thank you mr. speaker .
i did meet with the minister responsible for manitoba hydro when they were here and the delegation was here .
i also met with the ceo for manitoba hydro .
the presentation that the member talked about earlier , they said there were no cabinet people available , that we weren &apos;t there for that presentation .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you , mr. picco .
oral questions .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. speaker .
thank you mr. picco .
i am not quite sure mr. picco if you understood my question or whether you answered it .
so i think it would have been helpful if you had been there .
mr. speaker , again my question was , what is the next step in this process .
we have had a pre-feasibility study and it is my understanding and the minister can correct me on this , there is another , further detailed analysis and an environmental study required .
given that situation , where does the minister stand on this .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister responsible for the power corporation , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
what i can say mr. speaker , is that the member is correct .
the next step is a feasibility , this is a pre-feasibility study the next step would be a feasibility study .
so that would be the next step .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you , mr. picco .

minister responsible for the power corporation , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , some of the things they talk about is every house , every residence , every business in the keewatin that would be supplied by this grid would convert to electric heat .
mr. speaker , that is the prudent thing to do and that is what i as the minister responsible for the nunavut power corporation , intend to do .
over the next several months when that report is complete i will present that analysis to the member and to this house and for public discussion here in nunavut .
thank you mr. speaker .

speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
point of order , mr. premier .
point of order
hon. paul okalik :
thank you mr. speaker .
the member for arviat was implying that we did not attend a meeting .
we were not invited and if we were invited we would have gladly have attended such a meeting .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. premier .
although i didn &apos;t attend that presentation we will look at your point of order and we will continue with the oral questions .
oral questions .
you have one more supplementary mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i am not going to speak to the point of order , i am not quite sure if it &apos;s allowed at this point in time .
that was what my question was in reference to .
furthermore , mr. speaker , it is my understanding that this was a public meeting , open to the public .
i don &apos;t think that any of us need a private invitation to attend a public meeting .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister responsible for the power corporation , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i couldn &apos;t agree more with the member .
i think this government is being proactive .
we have to look at the costs and the implications .
it is very difficult for me as a minister of this government , to commit this government to millions and millions of dollars until we know exactly what the costs will be .
that &apos;s why we are doing the next stage , mr. o &apos;brien , that is why we are going to do the comprehensive study of the manitoba report .
there was a presentation and everyone had an option to go to view that report , but my understanding was that it was for the ordinary members .
there was a previous presentation made a few months ago , and i wasn &apos;t able to attend that one because i was at federal / provincial / territorial meetings in the south .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you , mr. picco .
oral questions .
mr. akesuk .
question 204 - 1 ( 3 ) :
retroactive funding to municipalities for fuel increases
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question is directed to the minister of community government &amp; transportation .
this year , since the beginning of this year , january 1 , the fuel price rates have gone up for the hamlet councils in the communities too .
they utilize fuel for heating and they are a major fuel customer in the communities .
are you going to be looking into whether you can subsidize the hamlet councils for fuel for the three months since the price went up .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. akesuk .
minister responsible for community government &amp; transportation , mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
we have not dealt with a subsidy program so therefore i cannot give you an adequate response as of yet .
i will take your question as notice as to if we can subsidize the municipalities for the three months .
we will look into that but i cannot give you detailed information as to how much subsidy will be given out .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. anawak .
oral questions .
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
if you will be looking into this , how much money will you be committing for the subsidy program for the new year on april 1st .
i am talking about whether you will be including january , february and march to subsidize them retroactively .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. akesuk .
minister for community government &amp; transportation , mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
we utilize fuel less in the summer time than in the winter time .
i cannot tell you whether we will subsidize january , february , march retroactively or whether it is for a full year .
perhaps we could subsidize from january 1 .
thank you .

question 205 - 1 ( 3 ) :
training for aqaumajuq fisheries employees
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question will be directed to the minister of sustainable development .
mr. speaker , i would like to work with the department and i would like to thank them for supporting the pairivik fisheries .
the minister has been giving support to the pairivik fisheries and since then the work order has been stopped by the workers &apos; compensation board , perhaps due to safety concerns .
the staff from the workers &apos; compensation board felt that our diving fisheries , pairivik diving fisheries needed more training .
i would like to ask the minister if your department would be able to give us support on the training part of it so that they can get back to work .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister for sustainable development , mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
he asked if the department of sustainable development would be willing to give those people more support .
if the clam fisheries wish to apply we will give them support .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu , oral questions .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
as soon as my community can get back to work , they want to get back to work .
will the minister be able to tell us when the training program will be implemented .

minister for sustainable development , mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i don &apos;t know if training has been done , there is none that i know of .
perhaps if they request further training and a certification program for the divers , they can ask or apply to get some funding if there is any funding left over .

perhaps if he could elaborate to me some of the details so that i could give you an adequate response .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kilabuk .
i will allow you to ask another question .
and rephrase it if you want mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
please allow me any old time you want .
we &apos;re talking about the divers training and also why did the wcb put a stop work order on these divers .
for safety reasons ?
we &apos;re talking about training for divers and certification for the divers and these divers have been diving for 2 years now and they are very knowledgeable about their job .
why did they do the stop work order .
perhaps we need further training .
i don &apos;t even know why we would need further training .
i &apos;m sure you can look into it .

gun control legislation
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker . i direct my question to the minister of justice .
it &apos;s along the line of the question i asked about gun control .
nti are responsible for the land claims agreement and the beneficiaries .
we have to pay close attention to the beneficiaries so that they can follow the statutes .
i was wondering if you have met with the nti in regards to gun control .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kattuk .
minister responsible for justice , mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the government of nunavut is not really working on the gun control issue .
we don &apos;t have that responsibility , it &apos;s the federal government that has that responsibility through the rcmp .
but the government of nunavut does not have the jurisdiction so therefore i have not met with nti .

mr. mclean .
question 210 - 1 ( 3 ) :
alcohol &amp; drug treatment centres
mr. mclean :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question today is to the minister of health .
we &apos;re almost completed one year in our mandate , mr. speaker , and a concern was brought up in my community about drug and alcohol treatment centres .
does the minister responsible have any kinds of plans to open up any new treatment centres .
because i think that there is , in my feeling , a need for these drug and alcohol and healing centres in nunavut .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
minister responsible for health , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , this is a very interesting and serious topic . in 1992 , we opened up the first residential treatment centre in nunavut .
at that time we projected that 216 people would need residential treatment each year at that centre here in nunavut .
in actuality , mr. speaker , instead of seeing 216 clients , we saw 7 clients in 1994 , 34 in 1995 , 57 in 1996 , 25 in 1997 and 21 in 1998 .
a total of 119 patients in four years .
mr. speaker , the cost of that program in 1998 / 99 , according to the figures presented to me was 640 thousand dollars , mr. speaker .
so what we &apos;re trying to do as a government is to analyse where we should be putting our resources .
so that &apos;s the question mr. speaker , we &apos;re doing a review of that right now .
most residential treatment centres in my understanding mr. speaker , in the north are closed .
in the yukon , the treatment centre is closed , the northwest territory treatment centre is closed , and indeed mr. speaker , the residential treatment centre in apex is also closed .
we &apos;ve had four people so far this fiscal year .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
oral questions .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you , mr. speaker .
but sometimes the individual is in circumstances where an outpatient service does not provide the type of care they need .
in some cases i would think that the person would have to be removed from the community to get away from the peer pressure of the alcohol , drugs and inhalants .
the minister replied to me that there are four people in the south .
does the minister foresee in the very near future having an institution or a little place that people can go to and rehabilitate rather than sending them south .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
minister responsible for health , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , this has been a very interesting topic because there are different types of addictions .
mr. speaker , there &apos;s the psychological and physical addiction to a certain drug or problem , for example , alcohol .
for those with true addictions mr. speaker , the option of residential treatment is one that we &apos;ve been looking at in the apex treatment centre .
but if we &apos;re going to treat people mr. speaker , we have to treat the whole person .
taking ed picco out of hall beach or baker lake and putting him in iqaluit and then treating him for six weeks has been found not to work .
that &apos;s why those treatment centres in those other communities have closed .
if the member is asking me is this government contemplating opening up treatment centres in all of our communities , the answer would be no .
the member is right , some of those are drug addictions , and some of those are alcohol addictions and so on .
each addiction is different , they can all be treated differently , the different types of substance abuse that they &apos;re having trouble with .
remember mr. speaker , let me make it clear , that any person that needs treatment receives the treatment that they need .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
oral questions .
final supplementary mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you , mr. speaker .
so i encourage the minister to re-evaluate what he &apos;s doing in his proposal and when can we expect to see it .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
minister responsible health , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i would like to begin by thanking mr. mclean , for his support in helping me with my addiction .
mr. speaker , 119 people in roughly four years who went through the treatment centre in apex .
the average cost per person at that time was 50 thousand dollars for a six-week treatment .
mr. speaker that equates to 6 million dollars over that four year period .
because they relapse and that person has to go back to that same environment .
i hope that answers the member &apos;s question .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :

item 9 :
replies to opening address
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na uqaqti and my fellow colleagues .
mr. speaker , i am pleased to rise today to reply to the commissioner &apos;s address .
as of last week , it &apos;s been one year since i had the privilege of being elected as an mla to represent my home community of baker lake .
i still feel good for having been elected .
this strong support that i have received from my constituency was overwhelming .
i want to thank my constituents for having continued strong support and good advice .
it &apos;s always difficult to single out certain people who were especially helpful to me because i know some will be left out .
however , i want to mention a group of people who have provided critical support and guidance and continue to be very valued advisors and supporters .
mr. pariour has recently been honoured , has recently honoured our community by being appointed to the nunavut law review commission by the premier .
i want to thank the premier for accepting this wise elder for such an important role .
i want to thank the late titus ateetnat who sadly passed away not long ago .
irene kiktalak is another valued advisor who has recently been honoured with a doctorate from the university of guelph .
jacob akeenalik , a strong member of my campaign committee , and others who provided me with great support were norman atungaluk and sally and david webster .
robert seeteenak was my able official agent and joe apaluktuk did a good job as my campaign manager .
most importantly of all , i wouldn &apos;t have run and couldn &apos;t have won without the strong support and encouragement of my wife emily and our children leean , kyle and terrance .
i know that i didn &apos;t get everyone &apos;s vote in the last election but i now feel that i represent the entire community .
i believe that we will make progress in our community if we pull together as one voice to make a better life for our elders , children and ourselves .
i have been fortunate in the past year that i haven &apos;t had to be away from home for too long .
that was the main reason i chose not to run for cabinet .
the people of baker lake told me they wanted me to be accessible .
i have opened an office in the jesse oonark centre so people can drop in and talk to me , to give me advice and express their concerns .
i am very pleased this is happening now .
in this reply to the commissioner &apos;s address i want to first turn to some of the very important issues i promised to work on during my campaign .
one of the key issues i spoke about was the need to create more jobs for the growing population of my community .
decentralization of government of nunavut jobs in baker lake .
when i was running for office , i knew that the inuit leaders and the interim commissioner had committed to the decentralization of jobs in nunavut .
i promised to work to ensure that some of these decentralized jobs came to baker lake where unemployment is very , very high .
my goal is not only to have these jobs created in baker lake but to have these jobs filled by the people of baker lake as well .
i applaud his commitment .
i have been working hard to ensure that there will be movement of government positions to baker lake once the new government office building is completed sometime in the year 2000 .
sport nunavut is already established in baker lake , and is here to stay i might add .
i am very pleased that 4 of those 6 positions have been filled , like i said , by long-term residents of baker lake .
the development division of the department of community government &amp; transportation will be moving 6 positions into baker lake in the near future as well .
i am also very pleased that baker lake will be the headquarters of the nunavut library system and will acquire at least 5 positions along with support staff .
i would like to express my opinion that nunavut should make careful plans to establish its own workers &apos; compensation board .
this should be done in full consultation with those affected representatives of employers and workers who contribute to the workers &apos; compensation board and who benefit most from its existence .
making a transition from the present joint nwt and nunavut workers &apos; compensation board will also undoubtedly require a period of intense negotiations .
i am expecting to see this program in operation this coming fall .
i would like to acknowledge the key role of the baker lake justice committee .
the outpost camp program also will recognize traditional knowledge and inuit qaujimajatuqangit by taking advantage of the wisdom and knowledge and compassion of our respected elders .
these outpost camps will support and teach our young people their traditional economy and way of life .
i give my whole-hearted endorsement to this initiative .
i am convinced that more communities like this one , in more communities will reduce crime .
replacing the decrepit old , falling down , rotten jonah amitnaaq school .
another issue is the deteriorating condition of the jonah amitnaaq school .
this school was built in 1957 .
it is currently the oldest in nunavut and the northwest territories .
this school is in bad shape and in fact it has started to literally fall apart .
the situation was well described in a headline in kivalliq news on november 24 , 1999 entitled , &quot; flirting with disaster &quot; .
the story described how a light fixture fell from the deteriorating ceiling of a classroom of the junior high wing and crashed to the student &apos;s desk below .
fortunately , this happened just after the students were dismissed for lunch .
this frightening incident resulted in the baker lake education council closing that wing for two months while temporary repairs were made .
in the course of investigating the building , evidence of asbestos was found .
asbestos is not allowed in modern schools or any other buildings today , because it is very dangerous to human beings .
tests were done on various sections of hallway pipes in the school and they were found to have between 10 and 30 % of serpentine asbestos fibres .
mr. speaker , it is completely unacceptable that our school children should be exposed to such dangerous materials .
i have been deeply concerned about this issue not only for the very obvious and serious health reasons , but also because these concerns are a serious distraction to the students from their studies .
i would like to thank the minister of education , the hon. james arvaluk for his concern and support about this issue from the first moment i approached him about it .
i believe that addressing this serious and urgent problem is a priority for the minister and his department , and i am looking forward seeing concrete plans to deal with this issue .
community based health and social initiatives .
my community also has pressing health and social needs .
i believe that the most effective health and social programs must be community based , and taking advantage of our people who have been taking good care of each other for thousands of years .
a perfect example of this principle is the baker lake pre-natal program run by betty houston and laura pruver , two long-term local residents .
the program is so successful i understand other communities are adopting it .
it has also been incorporated into a health promotion campaign on cbc television .
i want to commend these two residents for their hard work to make this program what it is .
we know that one of the worrying trends is the health status of northern peoples and its premature and low birth weight babies .
this program is working very well against this trend in baker lake , and it makes very good use of one of our abundant natural resources , country food .
in my campaign it was also very clear that constituents want to see social issues addressed .
one very strong concern was the need to hire and train an inuit mental health worker .
people need counselling for depression , sexual abuse and family violence .
they have told me how difficult it was to talk about themselves and these very sensitive issues unless the counsellor can understand the language and culture .
this knowledge is not something which can be learned in a southern university or school of social work .
this is an example of the residents &apos; desire to take advantage of traditional knowledge about traditional healing .
it seems so obvious to me that the people providing counselling and support must understand the language and culture of those seeking help .
i am still waiting for results for this important request .
i know that the minister and his department have been working very hard on the transition from health boards to the department of health and getting the department up to capacity .
i will continue to push to deal with this need .
we are very grateful to donna and her colleagues for their commitment to us , especially as we know it is a time of nursing shortages in many parts of canada .
supporting the traditional economy .
another serious issue in my election campaign was giving more support to all aspects of what i call the traditional economy .
i told carvers that i would try to find ways for them to get soapstone .
i am also pleased that a local man , mark toongwak has been contracted to carry and deliver the stone to the new carving room just opened in the jessie oonark centre .
this carving room was funded by the nunavut development corporation , which is ultimately accountable to the minister of sustainable development .
i &apos;d like to thank and acknowledge the hon. peter kilabuk also for the generous contribution from his department for the baker lake prospector program which is chaired by my constituent andy .
i hope this will an ongoing program because i know mining has great potential in that area .
so mr , speaker , the traditional economy is alive and well .
i am optimistic that with the continued support of mr. kilabuk and his officials , these programs will continue to thrive and flourish for the well being of all my constituents .
i am particularly pleased to see support for these programs because the beneficiaries of these programs usually have large extended families .
while i am very pleased about the support of what i call the traditional economy since i was elected , there is still much , much more to do .
baker lake is known for its arts and crafts but we have other areas that rely on our own human resources as well .
to create a solid economic base for our community we also need to support tourism .
tourists that want to view nature , the so-called eco-tourists as well as those who will come for sport fishing and hunting .
handled carefully , they will not only preserve the natural wonders , but they will also support our traditional way of life , the inuit language and culture .
the world now knows about nunavut since the creation of the new territory .
now we have to capitalise on this by getting the world to visit nunavut , to buy our arts and crafts , to view nature , to hunt and fish .
more of our people need to be trained as guides and supported as outfitters .
our new nunavut government must develop stronger new strategies to take advantage of our natural resources and our strong traditional economy .
i would like to see more support for tourism than is now in place in nunavut .
tourism could be much stronger in all nunavut communities .
i must say that i am not convinced we are spending our money as effectively as we could on tourism in nunavut .
i would like to see more direct benefits to communities , i would wonder if we are spending too much money on staff and travel , and not on product development and promotion .
is the department measuring the effectiveness of our spending in this area , should our priority not be more community based initiatives , more community tourism officers , and local training programs .
where we have potential for economic benefits in our community let &apos;s train people locally .
isn &apos;t it better that we bring one instructor into a community to train 20 local people instead of sending one person out to a far away training program .
northern benefits mean local jobs and training .
community based training and creating new jobs are the key to achieving the bathurst inlet goal of putting people first .
creating new jobs and the potential for mining .
for my constituency realizing my campaign promise to look at ways of creating new jobs in my community requires that i look at the mining sector .
with rich mineral deposits near baker lake i can see the potential for long-term job opportunities and mining .
i understand that mr. kilabuk &apos;s department has just completed a mining policy for nunavut .
i wish to congratulate the minister and his department for this .
clearly there must be a careful and orderly approach taken to examine every potential mining development and achieving maximum benefits for our residents .
many of my constituents are optimistic about the meadowbank gold project of cumberland resources , which is located close to baker , about 70 kilometres north .
mr. speaker , although the deposit is not huge , this find is apparently the richest concentration of gold in north america .
i have been in constant touch with the senior executives of the company expressing my very strong concerns about maximising local benefits to my community if this project goes ahead .
this is the only way to maximise business and employment opportunities .
achieving self-reliance .
mr. speaker , one of the main objectives of the bathurst mandate of the government of nunavut is self-reliance .
let &apos;s look at the enormous challenges this poses .
how do we create 10 thousand jobs in nunavut .
i think our government must take a realistic look at the potential of jobs in mining .
i know that we must look at each project carefully .
the nlca and the mandate of our nunavut and federal government give us the tools to ...
&gt; &gt; applause
i challenge our premier and his entire cabinet and our minister of dsd to take a closer look at opportunities at mining .
if this meadowbank project goes ahead my community will be looking at about 120 jobs in the construction phase including maintenance of a road , hauling fuel and supplies once the mine is built .
we are looking at 70-80 jobs at the mine itself .
this could have a profound and positive effect in baker lake , which has suffered far , far too long from at least half the people being without full time employment .
i don &apos;t have to look far before i see other , bigger opportunities in this region .
people from all over the keewatin , if they get trained , should have access to these jobs .
i believe we must press the federal government to give us their share of royalties from these resources .
if our nunavut government is serious about self-reliance , we must pay careful attention to any opportunity to create jobs for nunavummiut which will generate income tax revenues .
we know how much we need sources of revenue in nunavut .
how else are we going to provide housing , power subsidies , better health care , better education for a rapidly growing population .
we cannot rely on the federal government for money .
we must look for every opportunity to create our own sources of revenue .
when i ran for this office in this assembly , i hoped i could work with the new nunavut government to make life better for the little people in nunavut .
let us work together to make sure we don &apos;t lose an opportunity to create even one more job .
thank you mr. speaker .

i will be reading our recommendations on the ikuma report .
that the government of nunavut established the power corporation as an independent crown corporation .

three , that the government of nunavut consider an alternative to the independent public utilities board form of regulation currently required by legislation .
four , that the government of nunavut continue some form of rates subsidy for the short-term future , but only the short-term future .
thank you mr. chairman .

hon. ed picco :

yes we think that the recommendations read by the member fall in line with the report and some of the recommendations , indeed , are from the report .

mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
this report was put together and is in use by the nunavut government .
i have a question , will these regulations be used by the nunavut government , will those regulations be put in place for the nunavut government .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , the recommendations that you found in the report will be followed by the government .
those are the recommendations that were brought to cabinet and confirmed there .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
we don &apos;t fully understand the report and the recommendations and because i am not too clear about the report i am not sure if i would be able to support the recommendations .
i feel that i should be able to understand it clearly in order to support it .
so as a government , if we pass the motion without being too clear about the motion we would look bad later and start to regret our lack of understanding .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
perhaps i should ask this question first before i make a motion .
the documents that we have are a motion and if we approve it will we be following the recommendations .
will we be implementing it as soon as it &apos;s approved .
chairperson :
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
there is a long history there and i am not going to get into that .
we are here to debate the report and to talk about it and to have debate about the actualities itself .
the recommendations have been accepted and we &apos;re moving forward .
so that was one of the recommendations that we followed .
we also have available the summary , and the summary is about thirty some pages and that is a condensed version of the larger report .
maybe that would help the member too for understanding purposes .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. picco .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
i &apos;ll give the other members a chance to ask questions and get back to my motion later .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
following the list that i have .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , my colleague brings up a good point in reference to the detail and in some cases the areas that are technical and complicated .
having said that , i &apos;ve had an opportunity to review the short version and vaguely went through the larger document .
i &apos;m not concerned as to what is in the document , i &apos;m concerned about what is not in it .
the price has just risen over christmas .
i &apos;m curious as to why the minister did not include that aspect in his study .
it would seem to me that is first and foremost .
we are in most cases totally at the mercy of other people and other countries when it comes to the pricing of our fuel .
there is no guarantee that it will stop at thirty dollars a barrel , which it &apos;s at now .
i would assume the minister is looking toward trying to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels for many reasons .
not only the price of fuel and it being unpredictable , but also from an environmental standpoint .
thank you
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman , thank you member for the comments and questions .
on the first page of the summary that the member referred to you will see the reason for the report is spelled out , and those reason are as follows .
the options to assess the needs of nunavut &apos;s energy , nunavut &apos;s future electrical energy needs .
fundamentally the nunavut government must decide on one of two choices , to continue with the northwest territories power corporation or go it alone .
if the choice is to work out a shared arrangement with our western partners then several critical questions need to be met .
so , mr. chairman , the basic thrust of this report was to see if we needed to set up our own power corporation , or should we stay with the west .
looking at alternative energy sources and so on were touched on in the report but were outside the scope of the report .
thank you mr. chairman
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i just want to qualify my point and my comments .
i know there was a very talented group of individuals that were pulled together to do this report .
there have been many meetings and gatherings to come to this final conclusion .
i just fail to see why the minister would not include this very important aspect of energy .
i commend you on the report but it &apos;s not what is in it , it is what is not in it .
it &apos;s obvious that this is not the conclusion of your study .
when would the minister be contemplating on reaching out to this area .
thank you mr. chairman
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. minister .
hon. ed picco :
if you go through the report mr. chairman , you will see , for example , on the summary we talk about electrical versus fuel .
we talk about the opportunities of economies of scale .
another recommendation from the report was to integrate the petroleum products division into the new nunavut power corporation , and that would save a lot of money because of the economies of scale .
there is also the secondary stage drop type of generators .
instead of having a generator in a river you can put the generator in a lake or pond and that can generate several megawatts of electricity .
that was described in detail last week when we met with the manitoba hydro officials .
that was not a part of the report itself , studying what options are available in the generation of energy .
the report was predicated on finding out if we should separate or set up our own power corporation .
the next step for the nunavut power corporation , mr. chairman , would be to look at what mr. o &apos;brien is talking about .
but it is technical , and they say it is technically feasible .
they have not attached a real price tag for us .
that is what we need to do now , to see where we go from here .
to get from point a to point b.
i hope that helps answer the member &apos;s question .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister picco .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman , my final comment .
mr. chairman , i still have difficulty in accepting the fact that this wasn &apos;t included in such a major report .
the minister has explained himself and i will have to accept that .
i think to a certain degree we may have missed the boat .
we could have got the jump on this issue sooner than later .
i may have to ask the media about the amount of that surplus .
minister , given the fact that it would require federal dollars to take on a project like this , what would your next step be .
i know you have indicated the next step to further this along , when do you anticipate this happening .
in some ways we can get the jump on this and access some hydro from outside sources .
if we could get the jump on this we would have these companies tying into this line we speak of which would help subsidize the cost of this .
not only from an infrastructure standpoint but from the purchasing power . i think this is an issue that is critical and i think it should be dealt with as soon as possible .
i &apos;m somewhat disappointed that it wasn &apos;t included in the report .
the fact is it is not .
i would ask when do you anticipate taking the next step to review this .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister ed picco .
hon. ed picco :
in the recent mining development in the northwest territories the diamond mine , they were within 200 kilometres of the snare lake hydro project .
they didn &apos;t run an electrical hydro line from that station to the diamond mine , 200 kilometres away , to give them a power supply .
so what that means mr. chairman , is that just because we have a hydro line doesn &apos;t mean they will hook up to it .
but that is all outside the scope of the report that were talking about today .
the member did ask me when we would be doing the comprehensive analysis of the pre-feasibility study by manitoba .
in the house today i said we would be looking at that in the coming months , i would expect that it would take maybe three to four months maybe longer .
it would be inter-departmentally with the co-operation of some of the other departments including the executive and sustainable development .
so you are looking at six to seven years down the road , for that line and anything can happen in six or seven years .
that is our next step .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. picco .
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman , i don &apos;t want to say the interpreters are no good and i don &apos;t want to say the translators are no good , since we have different dialects .
when they say options in english in the translations we could not really understand part of the terminology in inuktitut .
the assembly has many rules and procedures , the person that is sitting next to me could not really understand it .
could you say the proper term for options in inuktitut .
thank you mr. chairman .
i hope they can understand what i &apos;m saying .
i &apos;m not trying to say the translators are bad it is because their dialects are so different that &apos;s why we had a misunderstanding .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. akesuk , for the clarification .
and it &apos;s not a question it is more of a comment .
thank you for the comment .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , the report indicates that one of the recommendations is that we have our own power corporation .
my question to the minister is by doing this , by having our own power corporation , will it cost the nunavut residents more or less than it does today prior to the split .
thank you mr. chairman
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. picco
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman , thank you to the member for the question .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , the minister indicated that aside from the initial start up cost that we will be faced with ... maybe two questions .
one , what would they anticipate those costs will be .
two , he has also indicated that it would cost us less than it does now , through the analysis he performed .
is the minister then indicating that we will be seeing , if this option is pursued , that we will see a reduction in power rates if this option is pursued .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , maybe for illustration purposes if the member has the report in front of him he could turn to note 1010 option a - minimum outsourcing .
he will be able to see some of the analysis for himself done by the working group and it is in the tabled report .
if he gets that then i will follow along and go through the analysis and the members can follow and see the analysis also .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo : the document is not numbered .
the number was 1010 ?
chairperson :
mr. picco
hon. ed picco : 1010 option a - minimum outsourcing .
and the answer is no .
so we have to purchase that expertise from one of the other utility companies .
we have gone now and narrowed that down to three different utility companies .
so , if the member has got 1010 , on the cost impact of an independent power corporation , he will see the cost there and follow along .
he will also see the average cost / kilowatt hour based on those cost differentials .
mr. chairman , that would mean a considerable decrease in some rates in some communities .
mr. chairman , those are exciting numbers .
those are real numbers , mr. chairman .
they &apos;re excellent numbers mr. chairman .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i must commend the minister for his ability to be able to dance around these numbers on these dazzling charts here .
he does that rather well .
he must have rehearsed that a couple of times .
mr. chairman , these numbers look good , what percentage , he said it was 1 point something , the number he talked about is supposed to be on this page .
i still can &apos;t find it .
i &apos;m just wondering what , like i asked , what would those start up costs be in a number .
not as a percentage of whatever , if i could please ask him to answer in terms of dollars and cents what those start up costs would be .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
mr. chairman , i &apos;m not trying to dance around the numbers .
the numbers are in front of the member and the members .
all i &apos;m saying is that the question was what the rate increase was .
i explained that there was no actual rate increase , and actually we &apos;ll see some rates drop in some communities .
but it depends on what level of outsourcing we do .
if we purchase all of our services from let &apos;s say manitoba hydro , then the costs are going to be more than if we get half of the services from manitoba hydro .
the graphs and the figures are in the book for deliberations or for questions .
but i &apos;ll ask the adm to maybe go into more detail on the costs , on the start up costs .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
i would like the deputy to go ahead and explain .
i forgot her name .
ms. gauthier :
thank you mr. chairman .
if i could maybe draw attention to that document note 1010 that the minister referred to earlier , it looks like there are three similar documents that go one after the other .
they map out three different scenarios .
one where you see us doing more of the work and building up the power corporation as quickly as we can for april 01 .
so that &apos;s what the three different scenarios are about .
they are all in the same chart format so that you can see how much each of those options might cost the government of nunavut .
when you look at note 1010 , option a , there are numbers on the left-hand column that go from 1-20 .
what we &apos;ve done is for the first three lines , 1-3 , that shows you what we would be paying if we stayed with ntpc for the next five years .
so you can see under years 1-5 , across the top of that chart , the cost per kilowatt-hour that you and me and every other citizen of nunavut would pay for power .
the next four lines from 4-15 are some of the costs that we &apos;ve identified in setting up this power corporation .
line 4 identifies all the one-time costs that include leaving or separating from the power corporation which totals 2 million dollars .
so if you look at line four , that totals roughly 2 million dollars .
there are legal and consulting fees , severance liability , head office costs .
not by much but there is a decrease .
year two , you look again at line 3 and you look again at line 12 , and there &apos;s a difference there again of a slight increase .
we expect that the cost for delivering power will go up every year because of inflation .
there &apos;s going to be costs when it comes to replacing a generator in a community or what have you .
there &apos;s going to be inflation costs as we go so you will notice that the numbers will go up over time but that &apos;s consistent with your regular inflation type activities .
so i hope that helps to clarify the chart a little bit more .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. gauthier .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i &apos;d like to thank ms. gauthier for her answer , for clarifying the chart .
it makes a little bit more sense .
is that correct .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
that is correct .
the member is correct .

redesign of student financial assistance system
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the goal of the transition phase was to establish systems and processes that would deliver cheques to our students twice a month as opposed to the former once a month .
in accomplishing this goal , we have answered the number one request from our student consultation .
we have also improved our bilingual communications services to students through the hiring of mary pameolik as the supervisor of student financial assistance .
this transition phase has assisted us in the development of a made in nunavut financial assistance program that will from today be known as financial assistance for nunavut students .
my staff will continue the system administration development for our new program and i look forward to reporting our progress to you in the near future .
thank you , mr. speaker .

mr. anawak .
minister &apos;s statement 62 - 1 ( 3 ) :
community based justice
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the nunavut government is committed to a system of community based justice .
this means that communities will be increasingly supported in taking greater responsibility for offenders and victims .
it also means that there will be a new emphasis on prevention and healing at the community level , rather than the formal approach involving charges , court appearances and incarceration .
in the past , the responsibility for dealing with people with problems has been removed from the communities by the formal justice system .
nunavut is now working to reverse that trend .
the department of justice has started the process of developing a new diversion protocol at the community level .
we are working on this with the community justice committees , the rcmp and the crown .
a protocol is essential if community based justice is to become a reality .
it will assist the rcmp , the crown and the communities because it will spell out their respective responsibilities , expectations and goals .
it is important to establish ground rules regarding roles and responsibilities so that there &apos;s consistency and efficiency in each community .
a diversion protocol leading to more active community responsibility would also increase the chances for healing to take place between the victim and the offender within the community .
there are a number of important factors to consider as we develop diversion protocols .
in all cases mr. speaker , diversion must have the consent of the victim .
if we &apos;re going to be doing that , there has to be counselling for both the victim and the abuser .
communities are unique in their dynamics and aspirations and vary in terms of their capabilities to handle diversions , therefore each community must be approached on an individual basis .
protocols may vary from community to community .
the types of cases handled by diversion protocols may change over time according to the capacity of each community to deal with cases .
signatories to protocol agreements will be the community justice committees , the rcmp , justice canada and nunavut justice .
nunavut justice will be responsible for assisting community justice committees to develop the capabilities to handle diverted cases and will provide ongoing support for the committees .
justice canada will play a role through funding assistance .
healing is an essential aspect of any community based solution , healing for the victim , the offender , families and the community .
people involved in diversion must be respected as individuals as each of us are different and every effort must be made to ensure discretion throughout the process .
case conferencing between the community justice committee , the rcmp and the crown should be considered as part of the diversion process .
any diversion protocol and the process to design it will be done in accordance with the principals of inuit qaujimajatuqangit .
a working group is being formed .
it will consist of the following ;
the nunavut status of women board will be consulted , as well as the department of culture , language , elders &amp; youth .
we envision model protocols that will vary to affect the needs , aspirations and current capabilities of individual community justice committees .
it may be that three or four models based on the same principles will be developed .
communities will be asked to select the model that best suits their community .
the development of diversion protocols is another way nunavut justice is working to ensure that communities have more authority and responsibility .
we want a justice system that will truly serve all nunavummiut .

federal languages agreement
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i rise to report today good news on our activities .
members of the legislative assembly , the negotiations for the canada-nunavut co-operation agreement for french and inuit languages has been concluded and signed .
this is a two-year agreement for fiscal year 99 / 2000 and 2000 / 2001 .
the total amount of the agreement is 5.1 million dollars .
each fiscal year 1.45 million dollars will go to french language programs and services .
each year 1.1 million dollars will go towards inuktitut language communities and inuinnaqtun languages .
i want to mention that whenever i say inuinnaqtun mr. speaker , that includes all inuktitut dialects .
mr. speaker , i want to briefly explain why the french services appear to be getting more funding than the inuktitut language services .
inuktitut language programs and services are funded by many existing programs .
as to the french language services , the purpose of this agreement is to ensure the provision of services in nunavut and to support community development in compliance with the nunavut official languages act .
my department has been given the responsibility for the administration of this agreement and i would advise the communities and the public to contact my department in order to access this funding opportunity .
( interpretation ) i wish to acknowledge the co-operation and contribution of the department of heritage canada , for making this funding available to the people of nunavut .
thank you , mr. speaker .

apex treatment centre
mr. mclean :
thank you , mr. speaker .
rehabilitation programs for inmates .
mr. speaker , it is well known that alcohol or substance abuse is a major factor in most crimes which lead to nunavut residents being jailed .
mr. speaker , in december 1998 , nunavut &apos;s only treatment centre was closed by the baffin regional health and services board .
the director of corrections and community justice for nunavut , ron mccormick said that the centre would be used as it was meant to be used .
this program will serve residents from all parts of nunavut since the bcc has inmates from all parts of nunavut .

funding for cultural programs
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i stand today to say i &apos;m pleased we met with the elders at noon hour and the statements of premier okalik i think should be recognised .
they are the true facts and we &apos;re working hard for the nunavut communities .
we are striving , whether we come to rankin inlet or any other community , so that before our elders pass away , these programs have to receive more funding .
we did not only discuss this but other people also had concerns which we heard .

thank you , mr. speaker .
i &apos;d like to thank the mlas .
i &apos;d like to thank the elders .
we met with the elders and through our government , if we &apos;re not going to enhance and push inuit qaujimajatuqangit , their voices in the future will be concerned about this .
we heard during lunch hour , our culture , our tradition our own nunavut is a very valuable thing to us .
the elders spoke very strongly that we have to urge ourselves in order that over the next 10 - 20 years we can address these concerns .
we have to act upon these concerns and we have to start taking action .
if we don &apos;t then we will be blamed for it .

member &apos;s statement 131 - 1 ( 3 ) :
lack of involvement of smaller communities
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i rise today to speak about my concerns for the smaller communities .
the smaller communities have to be involved , mr. speaker , for example my constituency of sanikiluaq .
i remember , when nic , john amagoalik came to our community back in 1998 , we were told that nic had recommended that sanikiluaq would have a seat at the nunavut legislature .
we were so pleased to hear that .
the sanikiluaq leaders were very pleased to hear that .
although sanikiluaq is quite far away , i know that the nunavut government will not forget that .
however , today , i would like to express my concern .
it hurts me inside .
at the arctic winter games , they forgot sanikiluaq for the trials .
the sanikiluaq residents , athletes , were not at the arctic winter games trials .
other athletes went to rankin inlet and iqaluit during the trials but they stated my constituency was too expensive to take our athletes to the trials .
i &apos;m very disappointed at not participating in the arctic winter games trials .
that &apos;s the concern i have .
last december there were athletes sent to cape dorset for arctic winter games trials but the sanikiluaq athletes . . .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
excuse me mr. kattuk .
your time is up and you have to get unanimous consent to continue your member &apos;s statement .
mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
i ask for unanimous consent to complete my statement .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
the member is asking for unanimous consent to complete his statement .
are there any nays .
you may continue , mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker , as i was saying , the athletes from sanikiluaq did not know if they were going to take part in the arctic winter games trials .
they hadn &apos;t been told whether they were going there or not .
the athletes were just waiting .
the sanikiluaq residents were told they couldn &apos;t participate at the arctic winter games trials because it is too expensive for their travel .
this is not acceptable .
i say we must represent all nunavut communities .
the smaller communities should be involved and participating along with all the other nunavut communities .
mr. speaker , today during question period i will be asking my questions in regards to that .
thank you , mr. speaker .

question about suicide
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
i would just like to explain why i asked the minister for transportation yesterday if he made the statement about suicide as a minister or as a regular mla .
i wanted to ask him some questions if he was making the statement as a minister .
i just wanted to make that clear .

member &apos;s statement 134 - 1 ( 3 ) :
nunavut social development council
mr. tootoo :
mr speaker , at the appropriate time i will be looking for unanimous consent to conclude my statement .
i tried very hard to get it into the allotted time , but i was unable to do so .
mr. speaker , the creation of nunavut was built on great hopes that things would be different if we had our own government .
inuit negotiated the land claims and held out for our own government .
mr. speaker , the land claim agreement does not say much about social issues , because the federal government wouldn &apos;t allow them to be put on the table for negotiation .
however , one of the articles does deal with social issues .
mr. speaker , nti &apos;s document released in january 2000 , entitled , &quot; taking stock ;
the report also notes and i quote &quot; in september of 1998 the gnwt proclaimed a new adoption act over the objection of nti and nsdc .
unquote .
nti and nsdc hoped for a different relationship with the nunavut government .
mr. speaker , nti &apos;s statement of position on section 3.3.2 is the following :
the nunavut government and the nsdc should develop a strong co-operative and consultative relationship in the pursuit of social policy reform in nunavut .
such a relationship should emphasise maximum participation for all organizations and individuals , and should foster a spirit of informed , creative and public debate on fundamental social problems and options .
mr. speaker , there are many areas of social policy reform that we need to undertake in nunavut .
speaker :
mr. tootoo your time is up .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker i would like to ask for consent to conclude my statement .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo is seeking unanimous consent to conclude his statement .
are there any nays .
they are no nays .
mr. tootoo you may proceed .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker and fellow colleagues .
the minister for inuit culture , language , elders and youth is developing a broad policy on inuit qaujimajatuqangit , as well as a language policy relating to the promotion and protection of inuktitut .
the minister of justice is committed to strengthening community justice .
the minister of health and social service is hoping to review many of his program areas once the regional boards are amalgamated .
mr. speaker , the government cannot act alone on these issues . it is not enough to send documents to key inuit organizations hoping for a quick response .
the nunavut social development council is not a special interest group .
mr. speaker , the nunavut land claim agreement sets up a constitutional requirement for the nunavut social development council to be involved in these important matters of language and culture .
nsdc is still a very young organization , it was only incorporated in 1996 and their offices were located in igloolik .
we need to mindful of this in our relationship and creatively look at how we can provide time , resources and support for collaborative efforts .
the bathurst mandate sets out the principles that will guide the government of nunavut , including the principle of full and willing commitment to the nunavut land claim agreement that will be the standard .
it further states that in the year 2020 nunavut is a place where the government of nunavut meets its obligations under the land claims agreement in the spirit of active co-operation .
the spirit of active co-operation , mr. speaker .
let us hope this spirit is alive today , as reflected in the clyde river protocol between the premier and the president of nti .
a relationship which also fulfils the nunavut government &apos;s legal commitment to the nunavut land claim agreement and therefore respecting the dreams of inuit and the creation of nunavut .
thank you , mr. speaker .

member &apos;s statement ( continued ) 132 - 1 ( 3 ) :
passing on cultural knowledge
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker , i apologise .
when this knowledge is not evident i know we are going to have problems such as suicides .
as a government today we have to tackle these issues so that inuit culture can be evident .
i know our young people regret their parents are not teaching them and they have just been put into school .
young people regret the fact they are unable to learn traditional culture .
our life is serious , it &apos;s not just a game .
perhaps inuit people should come up with a training program on tradition and culture .
this is what was given to us by our elders , this morning .
for us who are middle aged and the young people , there are three generations that have three different cultures .
utilising all the ways , we must come up with some kind of training program so that our young people can understand us and how we should be living .

success of nirqamut foods
hon. jack anawak :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr speaker , i rise in this house today to talk about a success story .
this success story is the keewatin meat and fish plant - nirqamut foods .
this plant mr speaker , is located in my riding of rankin inlet north and was officially opened in october of 1992 .
it was a pilot project by the nwt development corporation .
this allowed the plant to export products across north america and the orient .
this plant has exported its product as far away california .
mr. speaker , the staff are currently in the process of getting the plant ready to be inspected by a veterinarian so that they can obtain eu status .
with european union ( eu ) status mr. speaker , they will then be able to market their products to europe .
( interpretation ) this plant is very beneficial to the people of rankin inlet .
we now have 10 local hires and eighty percent of them are inuit .
they are going to be buying 120 thousand pounds from coral harbour that will be federally inspected and once that is done they will be hiring four more people to process the meat .
the employees are very hard working and they want to do the best that they can because they want to see this plant succeed .
i know that even the prime minister loved the locally made caribou jerky that was processed in the plant here .
he just loved it .
here are the names of some of the staff from the plant and i would just ask you to stand up .

utilising elders &apos; knowledge
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker . this morning when we met with the elders i truly believe their commitment to the statements they made .
i know they value inuit qaujimajatuqangit and they want to preserve it as it is really rich and they value it .
my heart is touched when we meet with the elders because i come from there and i really feel their comments .
they have lived that way and they want the nunavut government to recognize their way of life .
i know we will recognize them and we have committed ourselves to inuit qaujimajatuqangit and are involved in incorporating it .
they want to teach and leave their knowledge behind , and their language they want to leave to the young people of nunavut .
no matter who you are they want to utilise our language and as a government we are committed to them .
mr. speaker , the nunavut government has a huge task ahead of it .
but our elders &apos; beliefs and values have been stated .
i know we will incorporate their language and their comments into the system .
i want the elders to know that we will not forget them and we believe in the elders .
if it were not for the elders we would not have this government , and because of our elders we are here today .
please let &apos;s all agree with each other and hope that this legislature commits itself to the elders &apos; knowledge and wisdom , and that we will utilize it .

item 6 :
oral questions
question 211 - 1 ( 3 ) :
increased funding for fuel
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question will be addressed to the premier of nunavut , in regards to the high cost of fuel in the communities .
the nunavut government gives out money for operations and maintenance of the facilities and programs and services .
with the increasing fuel prices does that mean there is going to be an increase in the amount of funding that is made available to the communities .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. premier .
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
with the increase in the fuel prices we will be looking at more financial support .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
it &apos;s not only the hamlets that are provided funding , would you be considering giving increased financial support to the other institutions that are provided funding from the government .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i don &apos;t know about the other organizations .
thank you .

thank you mr. anawak .
oral questions . mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i did direct that question to the premier and he didn &apos;t answer my question .
but , my question was , will you be increasing the o &amp; m dollars to all the organizations or bodies at the community level .
this question is for the premier .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
the premier re-routed that question to mr. anawak .
mr. premier , you have to rise if you are going to re-route that question to other members .
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
i apologize , like i said earlier , we were anticipating the hamlets asking for increased dollars because of the increase in fuel costs .
we anticipated their needs and we do know that other people , organizations get funding from the nunavut government .
we &apos;ll be asking the appropriate departments to see if they could get an increase in their o &amp; m dollars .
i am just using the hamlet as an example .
because we anticipated the increase , we looked for the funding , and i am sure that the other organizations will be looking to the appropriate departments to increase their o &amp; m dollars .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
oral questions .
mr. o &apos;brien .
question 212 - 1 ( 3 ) :
proper spelling of names
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question is directed to the minister responsible for elders , youth and culture .
mr. speaker , in october i posed a question to the minister in reference to the spelling of names .
a number of people have contacted me in my community in regards to the spelling of names changed to where in some cases it doesn &apos;t mean the same anymore .
the same names but the spelling has been changed and doesn &apos;t represent the name that they were given at birth .
the minister said that he would look into this and get back to the house .
i am asking the minister now what plan has he developed or what has taken place since october in this regard .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister responsible for culture , language , elders &amp; youth , mr. havioyak .

mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , maybe the minister could be a little clearer on this issue .
is there any attempt been made to create a register where individuals could contact his department and get some assistance as to how to go about getting their name properly spelled .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister of culture , language , elders &amp; youth , mr. havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
we don &apos;t want to make mistakes , we want to work in a good way , the right way .
we can &apos;t just finish right away , it takes time , because we don &apos;t want to make mistakes .
we have to review all the spelling right now .
i want to reply to your question but sorry , it &apos;s not quite finished yet .
some of them are , if i find out more information on this about the names , i will let you know .

my question today is , did cabinet approve the department of justice proposal to use the treatment centre in apex for rehabilitation .
ma &apos;na .
speaker :
thank you .
minister responsible for justice , mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , the department of justice and the department of health &amp; social services have discussed this issue but at this point they have not taken it to the cabinet level .

thank you mr. anawak .
final supplementary , mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you , mr. speaker .
that brings forward another question that we all been saying for the last year or so , about rehabilitation on the land program infrastructure .
there is not much money around to build buildings and things and i am not sure what the cost of that building in apex is .
i think it was built for a noble cause and now it &apos;s sitting there empty .
does the department of justice have any plans for that building or is it just going to sit there empty and taxpayers dollars wasted .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
minister responsible for justice , mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak :
but at the same time however that doesn &apos;t mean that the department of health and social services may not have some plans for it .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
oral questions .
mr. puqiqnak .
question 214 - 1 ( 3 ) :
funding program for youth centres
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
the minister of culture , language , elders and youth said that he was working on a policy for youth .
many young people in the communities want youth centres .
my question is , has the minister established a fund to assist community groups , who wish to operate youth centres in their communities .
speaker :
minister for culture , language , elders and youth .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , i &apos;ve already answered that through the policy .
we wanted to get some clarification from the youth on how to put a policy in place for the youth of nunavut .
i believe there are two questions on funding assistance .
we have in our department a funding source for our youth .
the funding that we are working on is going to be aimed towards the elders and the youth and they are going to be helping one another .
so we have to provide some funding to the youth and we can use this funding for counselling them , so they learn our way of life .
right now we don &apos;t have a concrete plan for funding to build youth facilities , but we will be discussing this in our budget session in iqaluit .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. havioyak .
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
which departments have you been working with .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker and thank you for your question .
we will be discussing this further in our budget session in the near future .
i have met with youth groups in cambridge bay and pond inlet .
we will be reviewing this and discussing this further in our next session .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. havioyak .
mr. irqittuq .
question 215 - 1 ( 3 ) :
harvesting bowhead whales
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
yesterday i was talking about bowhead whales .
my question is to the minister of sustainable development .
what is your position in regards to the bowhead whale harvest .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
minister for sustainable development .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
yes , perhaps to explain a little .
when we deal with marine mammals it &apos;s the department of fisheries and oceans and if we are going to be dealing with any type of species it is the nunavut wildlife management board .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kilabuk .
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
although i understood his reply are you going to be supporting the harvest as the minister for wildlife issues .
my question is are you going to work hard for nunavut concerns on this .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
minister for the department of sustainable development .
mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
when we deal with marine mammals it is under the jurisdiction of the department of fisheries and oceans - the federal government and the nunavut wildlife management board .
if they request support we will assist them but we do not have that jurisdiction .
it is the nwmb that has that jurisdiction .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. kilabuk .
oral questions .
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i understand , however during our campaigning days we spoke of the issues that concern us .
i know that we spoke about issues that we can &apos;t do anything about .
the minister is responding to me that the nwmb is responsible for that , but my question is , are you going to work hard to support the nunavut needs .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
minister responsible for sustainable development .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
yes , we have been working very hard and we are not going to stop the close working relationship that we have with the nunavut wildlife management board .
we have to work in partnership in the management of wildlife and we have to work with the department of fisheries and oceans .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kilabuk .
oral questions .
mr. tootoo .
question 216 - 1 ( 3 ) :
holistic healing programs
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker . mr. speaker , my question is for the minister responsible for health and social services .
mr. speaker , the minister spoke yesterday about the need to deal with the whole person when dealing with alcohol and drug abuse .
this would imply programs that work with people on a physical , spiritual , emotional , intellectual and cultural basis .
mr. speaker , it is very difficult to imagine how a social worker trained in the south will be able to deliver such a program to inuit in our communities .
much of the teaching the elders have to offer is spiritual , cultural , social and personal in nature .
as mentioned by the other members a holistic program would require the involvement of elders and local people in the community .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister responsible for health , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , if i could just get a piece of clarification if i could .
there are different aspects to the holistic approach when treating addictions and treating problems with individuals .
which approach is the member talking about when he asks this question .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
mr. tootoo i will allow you to ask the same question , and rephrase it . mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
sorry the minister didn &apos;t understand my question .
thank you , mr. speaker . speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo . minister responsible for health .
mr. picco . hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker as the member knows we are doing that right now .
we are running one of the first pure inuit social programs in igloolik .
i believe we have five people ready to graduate with their bachelor &apos;s degree in social work .
mr. speaker , we are also doing work with our alcohol and drug counsellors using the apex treatment facility .
we are bringing them into apex and using reality based therapy , that type of treatment model .
so mr. speaker , not only are we using the holistic approach in treating alcohol as well we are using the mental and spiritual side of development of the person .
we are delivering those programs culturally and sensitively and , in the example of igloolik , training northerners , training people from nunavut to be able to deliver those programs .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
oral questions , mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker , i would like to thank the minister for his response .
he indicated that there is a social worker program being held in igloolik and reality based treatment going on in the apex treatment centre .
is it geared specifically towards nunavut or is it the same program that is being offered down south .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo , you have exceeded your two questions .
minister responsible for health .
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
well first of all mr. speaker , in the preamble of the member he asked whether we are trying to take the programs and make them nunavut or northern based .
that is what the program in igloolik is doing .
now i &apos;m not the minister for education and i don &apos;t have the curriculum in front of me or the program .
my understanding is that mr. speaker , that the social work program being run through arctic college is centring on our students who are all inuit from nunavut , specifically from igloolik .
it is an excellent program .
i believe the member probably saw an article in news north highlighting and extolling the virtues of the program .
we have been doing this for the past several months and we have been doing workshops and on the job training with those staff .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
oral questions mr. akesuk .
question 217 - 1 ( 3 ) :
training for alcohol &amp; drug counsellors
mr. akesuk :
mr. speaker my question is for the minister of health and social services .
mr. speaker , having trained staff is essential to be able to deliver quality programs .
many of the community alcohol and drug counsellors do not have very much training and very little on the job training has been provided in the past .
the workers themselves have asked for training so they can do a better job .
can the minister advise what new training initiatives are now being delivered to community based alcohol and drug counsellors with money saved from the closure of nunavut &apos;s only drug treatment facility .
thank you , mr. speaker .
thank you mr akesuk . minister of health &amp; social services , mr. picco .
the savings from the closure of the apex treatment centre , which is a misnomer , because the centre is not closed , we are just not using it for residential treatment .
we are actually bringing our employees into our centre and providing on the job and professional training there .
so i hope that actually answers the members &apos; question .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk :
thank you , mr. speaker . can the minister advise us on what new training initiatives are being developed for community based alcohol and drug counsellors in the future .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr akesuk . minister of health .
hon. ed picco :

mr. speaker , we are trying to bring some new initiatives forward but those discussions pertain to the budget .

oral questions .
mr. nutarak .
question 218 - 1 ( 3 ) :
resources for community health committees
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is for the minister of health and social services .
mr. speaker , the minister spoke yesterday of the need to treat the whole person when it comes to addictions , and his support for community based programs .
mr. speaker , we all know a person &apos;s family and community play a big role in being able to support people in making lifestyle choices .
mr. speaker , the standing committee has strongly recommended the creation of and support for community health committees .
but communities can play more of a role in health promotion and prevention programs in their community .
can the minister please advise this house what his plans are to develop and provide resources so that we can have effective community health committees created .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
minister of health &amp; social services , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i appreciate the question from the member .
earlier this week i again met with the members of the keewatin .
two weeks ago i met with the members from the kitikmeot and in december as the member knows , i met with mayors from the baffin region .
so i met with almost all the mayors in all of nunavut to discuss the plans after april 1st , when the health boards are integrated .
some of the support that we &apos;re giving them includes administrative support , logistic support , training , as well as a financial contribution .

oral questions .
mr. kattuk .
question 219 - 1 ( 3 ) :
sanikiluaq athletes at arctic winter games
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is in regards to my constituency .
today , i &apos;m going to be making reference to comments that i made this morning under members &apos; statements .
sanikiluaq would be very interested if they could be involved in the arctic winter games .
they would also like to be involved in the nunavut arctic winter games .
but i know that the co-ordinator of the arctic winter games is here in nunavut and i know that the minister is not involved in the co-ordination and the planning of arctic winter games .
but i would like to ask the minister of community government and transportation about the funding provided to the arctic winter games .
( interpretation ends ) my question to the minister , does he agree that the arctic winter games should be open to residents from all communities , even the smaller communities .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. kattuk .
minister responsible for community government and transportation , mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i feel very much for the comments made by the member .
when we were elected and when we are truly representing our communities , we have to represent everyone .
i believe that every community has the right to be involved in any of the programs , services or games because of course sanikiluaq is a part of nunavut .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. anawak .
oral questions .
mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
listening to the response , it &apos;s not adequate .
saying that sanikiluaq is too expensive has always been an excuse for a very long time and it &apos;s something that doesn &apos;t sit well with the residents of sanikiluaq .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kattuk .
minister responsible for community government , mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
everyone has a right to participate in the same services , be it health , games or anything .
sanikiluaq is a part of nunavut , but i think that because of their location they weren &apos;t involved .
i don &apos;t think we should think about the cost , the next time there are arctic winter games in 2002 , and we should include all the communities .
for example , sanikiluaq should be involved in the 2002 games and not think about the costs .
we have to start the planning process so that they will be involved .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
oral questions .
mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
thank you very much for that response but sport nunavut , do they have regulations or a policy , saying they should treat all communities equally including the smaller communities .
i would like to know that the small communities , all the communities of nunavut should be involved whether they have a large population or not .
that &apos;s my question mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
minister of community government and transportation , mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
there is no such policy saying that any community can be involved or participate .
the problem that we encountered should not even be considered .
if there are athletes in sanikiluaq , they have to be included in the trials , and i don &apos;t think that we should even have looked at the costs .
what i &apos;m trying to tell the member here is that there is no policy to not include the smaller communities .
i can use coral harbour for example .
it &apos;s a small community , but there are a lot of athletes who will be participating at the arctic winter games .
we shouldn &apos;t even include or consider the expense .
we will take that into consideration .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
oral questions .
mr. iqaqrialu .
question 220 - 1 ( 3 ) :
funding for inuktitut language programs
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is directed to the minister of culture , language , elders &amp; youth .
that &apos;s a very small amount when you look at the vast territory that we have .
i &apos;m not quite happy about the figures that are here with the money .
they are looking at the whole of nunavut .
there are no french schools .
there &apos;s only one i believe in iqaluit , and they have a french school .
the amount of money that is handed out for the french language , programs and services is larger than the one for inuktitut languages .
talking to the elders this morning , they &apos;re saying it is now an urgent matter to teach our youth and again there is no money put aside for the elders .
there &apos;s going to be nothing that &apos;s going to be coming out with the small amount of dollars that &apos;s put towards inuktitut language programs .
we have to do something about it .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
before the minister makes a response , please make you question short and to the point .
i would appreciate it .
minister of culture , language , elders &amp; youth , mr. havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
in your questions , it &apos;s very good and i agree with that .
in inuinnaqtun language , it &apos;s aimed at all the people because this agreement is for 2 years and if the funding is not enough we will try to go for more .
we have funding there for anything to do with language .
and also we have money , it &apos;s in our department and also for elders .
we can always try and get funding from other sources , and we can look at the plan .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. havioyak .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , thank you very much for making your point .
i don &apos;t think you should just look around , you should find some so that there will be adequate funds available for the elders for the teaching aboriginal languages .

question 222 - 1 ( 3 ) :
list of contracts from nunavut government
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
we are in the process of finalising the list . we &apos;ve had to work with each of the departments and try and find out every contract so it &apos;s taken a bit long .
but we hope to table , hopefully if not at the end of this week , by the end of next week . thank you , mr. speaker .
thank you mr. premier .

mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , would the premier commit to providing the house with quarterly reports on contracts that have been issued .

would the premier commit to that .

consideration in committee of the whole of bills and other matters
chairperson ( mr. irqittuq ) ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. iqaqrialu &apos;s chair is quite tiny .
in the committee of the whole we are going to continue dealing with the items from yesterday , and the ministers &apos; statements .
maybe if the minister could go to the witness stand , we are going to deal with 45-1 ( 3 ) , and the tabled document 27-1 ( 3 ) .
thank you ed picco .
if you could take the witness stand to discuss the tabled document .
we realize that you &apos;ll have to introduce yourself for the record .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister .
we &apos;re going to continue with the minister &apos;s statement and the tabled document we dealt with yesterday .
are there any comments .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
the ikuma report , under 9 , i &apos;d like to get a better clarification on the conclusion .
would they continue , would they proceed the way this ikuma report is tabled .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. minister .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
that &apos;s an excellent question from mr. iqaqrialu .
and i appreciate his question .
mr. chairman , the ikuma report was commissioned to look at various options available to the nunavut government to provide electrical power to nunavummiut .
the number two point was general policy and regulatory issues associated with power rates and subsidies that must be decided by the people and the government of nunavut .
that &apos;s what we &apos;ll be moving forward on , our own nunavut power corporation .
so , that &apos;s the recommendation the member was talking about i think .
i hope that helps answer the question .
i thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. picco .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
do i understand the headquarters are going to remain there , can you elaborate that to me and make me understand .
thank you mr. chairman .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman . mr chairman , it &apos;s a good question .
some of the options that we , i am sorry , go ahead mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
before the minister makes a statement , you should address me .
go ahead minister .
hon. ed picco :
mr. chair , excellent decision .
wise .
thank you mr. chairman , a good question again from mr. iqaqrialu .
on the location of the head office and maybe some of the responsibilities i think what he was trying to say , the head office functions .
for example , in hay river they have positions that are dedicated to gas , for example , we are not dealing with that here in nunavut .
hydro electrical power , they operate some hydro electrical power generating stations in the west and you don &apos;t have them here , those positions wouldn &apos;t be there .
on the location of the nunavut power corporation he is correct , the headquarters for the nunavut power corporation would be located in nunavut itself .
we would have an opportunity for training and the other positions that are involved in the nunavut headquarters of our corporation .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
if they could make a correction on the title of the territory .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
did you want to make a response mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman and thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
very observant of you to spot that .
so , yes laura has just made a note of it and we &apos;ll make sure that &apos;s fixed in the inuktitut copy .
thank you very much .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mla for uqqumiut .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman , my last question .
i think we should make a correction that nunavut , ntpc , i just wanted to make a clarification on that .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
would the minister like to respond to that .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
so , the member is correct on how the capital plan is spelt there and the name .
the difference being , it shouldn &apos;t be the nunavut power corporation , it &apos;s actually taken out of the ntpc one and therefore i think the terminology used is correct .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
do you have any other questions .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
my question is very brief now .
once we get the nunavut power corporation , at that time we &apos;ll take over the northwest territory part of it .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , that is a good point .
then those figures will be presented as ours .
so i would thank the member again for his suggestion and guidance in that area .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
perhaps i would like to remind the minister again , his question was very brief .
your response is quite long , you should respond yes or no .
the question requires a yes or no answer .
the second speaker , mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman i just have a few comments to make .
i know the other members have numerous questions they want put forward .
so i &apos;ll be brief .
in speaking of this report , yesterday , my comments to the minister were that i didn &apos;t see any major problems with the report .
they were at the point where they were even using diesel generators to provide power to the rest of the area .
so it wasn &apos;t that it wasn &apos;t a good idea , the mines were looking at a power link but unfortunately , the power corporation could not provide that amount of power .
thank you .
chairperson :
minister .
hon. ed picco :
yes mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
what a wise response .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman , i realize that you asked the members to keep their remarks short , but i don &apos;t think that necessarily meant non-existent .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. minister , would you like to respond .
hon. ed picco :
i guess mr. chairman , over the next three to six months would be a pretty solid time frame to be able to complete an analysis of the manitoba report .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i find that time frame somewhat long and unacceptable .
i think the basic report has been in the hands of this government since the fall .
there were presentations made in the fall to various ministers and departments , and the recent presentation that was made here this week .
there have been no significant changes to the report .
i realize that you yourself are not in a position to commit to any large expenditure and that is understood .
i think that is a decision of the house .
but , i would like to hear what your department and yourself have to say about this report .
i would like to see your response back to this house within the next two months .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
would you like to respond mr. minister .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , first of all , i have no department .
as the members know , we are in the middle right now of hiring our first employee of the power corporation , that would be the president .
manitoba hydro has come forward with a proposal that this line , this hydro line is technically feasible .
saskatchewan , for example , mr. chairman , has a hydro line that goes right to the border .
would it be cheaper to hook up that one , we don &apos;t know .
so that is the type of analysis we want to be able to look at and see other energy , viable energy reports .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
so , chairman , my next question to the minister would be , what commitment has the minister made to the minister of the power corporation from manitoba in reference to this report .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
minister , would you like to respond .
hon. ed picco :
but i did say to the member and what i did say to the minister was that the nunavut government wants an opportunity to analyze the report from our point of view .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. minister .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman . i don &apos;t think it &apos;s acceptable that the member continues to try to raise me to the point of debate on this report , the manitoba hydro report .
we are suppose to be here to study the ikuma report . the ikuma report was to take the idea to see , should we have our own power corporation .
it wasn &apos;t looking at alternative energy sources , it wasn &apos;t made to look at the manitoba hydro report .
now , between now and april 1 , 2001 we are going to try and get a nunavut power corporation up and running .
we need to select our headquarters , we need to staff up , we are in the middle of getting the president .
and i have committed to the member that we will do the analysis that is needed so that the best choice for nunavut can be made .
that will take three to six months to do that .
and i have also committed to bring that information back to the house for these members to see .
mr. chairman , i think that is quite fair .
i don &apos;t know what else i can do .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. o &apos;brien , are you out of questions now .
mr. o &apos;brien :
it is unfortunate that it wasn &apos;t .
and i think in general i am talking about not only hydro but also other alternative sources of power .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
that was just a comment .
mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , that is an excellent question .
and the reason for that is the differences of the economies of scale pointed out in the report itself .
that was an excellent question and maybe for the member , we don &apos;t see the prices going up , we don &apos;t see the current costs increase in the new nunavut power corporation .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i know that you are not going to increase the rates but what i am thinking is that annually the cost of living increases each year .
i am a bit leery about increasing the power rates , especially for the homeowners .
if the rates are increased , my constituency won &apos;t be able to afford to pay for the power bills .
since the fuel price went up us homeowners have to pay extra for our bills .
i would like to get adequate response to my question .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
the member is correct in his comments .
now , this will give me an opportunity to explain the earlier statement that i made .
creating the corporation , the new nunavut power corporation , won &apos;t cause rates to increase .
however , as the member pointed out and rightfully so , there are other inflationary factors , for example , if fuel increases and so on that may cause these rates to increase .
having our own nunavut power corporation , mr. chairman , gives us the advantage of ownership and the ability to control more of our destiny .
and when i say that mr. chairman , i should point out what i mean .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
the ikuma report , i think perhaps the minister could give us more time to read the report .
that &apos;s what i was suggesting , if it &apos;s not urgent that you give us more time to read the report .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i do have authority to defer this , but we would have to do this by way of motion .
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , the major recommendation of the report as the members know is to set up our own nunavut power corporation .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re moving forward on as i have already presented that to the standing committee and so on .
but i agree with the member , if there is more time needed for members to read the report and digest it , i have no problem with that , i welcome that .
and , i will take direction from the committee .
but the major recommendation of the report has been followed through on already .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
so that is my last remark mr. chairman .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i thank the member for his comments . i can tell he has done some good reading on the report , some good questions .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
mr. chairman , i want to have a preamble .
i &apos;ll try and keep it short .
then i want to ask questions .
thanks mr. picco for putting this report together .
&gt; &gt; applause
mr. mclean :
i commend the minister for doing this and showing the vision that we always talk about in the house .
the vision of nunavut .
i know the minister has set up a public utilities board , which i think is great .
we finally got it , and i am a firm believer that we move forward and i am proud that the minister and cabinet have decided to set up a nunavut power corporation .
because the thing that we are not hearing here , you know the west who is our partner right now , are they going to subsidise us .
i don &apos;t think so .
but that &apos;s about all the praising i &apos;m going to do with mr. picco at this point because i think he needs a little thing .
mr. chairman i &apos;d like to ask my questions now .
is that a relatively close figure , so will it cost us 3 million dollars to run the head office in nunavut .
so we are saving 1.5 million a year in head office costs by establishing our own power corporation , is this correct .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , first of all i would like to thank and sincerely thank the member for his earlier comments .
the work on the power corporation itself has been the work of the cabinet and indeed the members themselves because we have been apprising them and getting their direction and so on .
i think the members themselves need some thanks for that too as well as my cabinet colleagues .
now , on to the questions , mr. chairman , the member is right , creating the corporation itself won &apos;t cause rate increases but other inflationary factors may .
for example the price of fuel and so on .
but having our own power corporation gives us the level of control that we don &apos;t have now for example the low water rider in yellowknife .
on the questions on page 44 , 106 , the member is correct .
that &apos;s very astute of mr. mclean to pick that up .
again those costs will depend on what level of outsourcing the government of nunavut puts in place with the new power corporation .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you .
enough of the niceties here . there &apos;s a two million dollar leaving penalty that will be incurred regardless of when nunavut decides to go on it &apos;s own .
was that something that was decided before april 1 , 1999 and by who .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you . mr. minister .
hon. ed picco :
mr. chairman that two million dollar leaving penalty was before this government took office .
it was part of the discussions , the on-going negotiations between nti the gnwt , ntpc and the oic .
and that &apos;s correct mr. chairman , the western coalition was involved at that same time .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
how much long term debt are we going to assume .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. minister .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , the share of the debt is based on the total ownership of the power corporation .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. picco .
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. minister .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , there is a three-step methodology in deciding the split in assets and liabilities of the power corporation east and west .
for example we have what we call stranded assets and those are the physical power plants themselves on the ground .
we have the assets which would include , mr. chairman , the oil in the storage tanks , because someone paid for those and they have a value and those would also be there .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
ms. gauthier .
ms. gauthier :
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. gauthier .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. minister .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
i &apos;d say to the member that there has been no discussion at the government level about ending the power subsidy program .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. chairman .
the territorial power subsidy program at this point i think is in the neighbourhood of 2.6 million .
am i correct in saying that .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
so , in an essence the statement by the member is correct .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. chairman .
so you are saying that what you have told me is that the subsidy rate subsidises the power bills for all of us .
now on that topic how do you , how does fmb figure out what kind of a subsidy they are giving us .
is it based on a power rate in yellowknife .
or is it going to be based on a power rate in iqaluit or is it going to be based on a power rate in arviat .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman we will be continuing the territorial power subsidy program based on the yellowknife rate up until the point we have an opportunity we have to re-evaluate the tpsp .
the tpsp , as most members know , was put in place almost 21 years ago .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
that &apos;s all the questions i have mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
in the report itself on page 22 of 106 you can see how that paying for power and a nice flowchart that has been developed by the ikuma report , the working group works .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman is it the goal to reduce the total subsidy cost or reduce the rates being passed onto the customers .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , the member is correct .
the ikuma report actually went into some detail on the territorial power subsidy program and so on .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman the minister indicated they are looking at it fourteen , sixteen months down the road to review the subsidies .
i &apos;m just wondering what process will be used in reviewing the rate subsidies between now and then .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , the ikuma report really didn &apos;t detail , i guess what the member may be asking for but the cabinet hasn &apos;t really decided what to go for on this .
you know we want to get the power corporation up and running and that was the major thrust of the report and that was the recommendation that we accepted .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , courtesy of the good offices of the premier , he has mandated and set up the nunavut public utilities board .
i believe the chairperson of that board is actually from here , in rankin inlet , mr. mercer .
so any move by this government to increase the rates or indeed eliminate the territorial power subsidy program would have to go before the public utilities board .
so , i think it &apos;s safe to assume mr. chairman , that the government of nunavut would consult on their rates and indeed the power subsidy itself .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , the ikuma report also recommends eventually combining the petroleum products division in order to eliminate the duplication of services .
mr chairman , does the minister have any indication of a time frame that is being considered for the integration of those services .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman that is an excellent question that has come up before when some people have reviewed the report .
i just want to go back on the question of the power subsidy .
the power subsidy itself of course is not brought forward to the public utility board .
one of the largest purchasers of fuel in nunavut is the power corporation .
it would probably make sense as it was pointed out in the report , that some integration in the areas of operation of government be integrated .
it may be something that may be reviewed over the next several months as we get more inline with the setting up of the corporation .
and i &apos;ll ask laura to add further comments to that .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
ms. gauthier .
ms. gauthier :
thank you mr. chairman , if i could direct the members &apos; attention to the summary document page one and two .
one of the goals that cabinet endorsed is goal number four which basically looks at a conservation ethic that would be promoted within nunavut and consumers themselves .
so that whole area , while we are trying to get the power corporation up and going it is not deemed to be critical enough .
we look at focusing our energies at getting the utility up and operational for april 1 .
thank you mr. chairman
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , while developing their report the team had nti participate in the development of it and i would like to commend the minister for involving them in it .
what i would like to ask the minister is if there are any specific issues that they raised in regards to this process .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
so i don &apos;t think that was the case .
thank you , mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , at present ntpc is exempt from the provisions of article 24 .
i would like to ask the minister if the nunavut power corporation will be as well .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman that is an excellent question .
so that will be one of the issues that we will look at .
i would suspect mr. chairman , that the power corporation , boards and agencies of government of nunavut would follow some of the articles of the land claim .
that would be my opinion , but again we would have to look at that after we set the power corporation up .
of course right now the reason ntpc doesn &apos;t follow them is because ntpc is a trans-territorial company .
it operates in other jurisdictions other than just nunavut .
of course the majority of shareholders are located in the western region , or the northwest territories our former partner .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman , mr. chairman , i guess as the minister had indicated that the he involved nti up to this point in the development of the ikuma report .
will nti continue to be involved in the development of the corporation .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. picco
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , it wouldn &apos;t be involved in the actual setting up of the corporation because that would be the mandate of the government itself .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i have a question but i would like to make a comment for the minister and his team who did a tremendous job making this report .
i know it takes time and effort to make this thick a report .
also , i feel we need a corporation in our region that is fair and square for all nunavummiut .
that we can have say to it , because at this point we have no say for example on power cut off notices which are only in english .
so if we have our own corporation in our region it will also be under the nunavut government , we can also have a minister .
i would like to say that we need it the sooner the better .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. picco do you want to make a comment .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman . i would like to make a quick comment .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman i &apos;m glad i can have an opportunity to make a comment before the time is up .
in the ikuma report , if we can look at the ikuma report on page 111 in the inuktitut part .
in english it is just a5 .
looking at the numbers in there , if we look at the communities and we look at clyde river .
if i look at the figures here , this is going to mean a deficit for clyde river .
using the ntpc system , clyde river will be in a deficit for three million dollars even though we are quite small in size and we don &apos;t have any economic opportunities .
looking at the three million dollars this is a huge deficit for clyde river and they will have to pay for that deficit themselves .
we want to get our own nunavut power corporation and i have been supporting that idea because i feel that the three million dollars will have to be paid in clyde river .
that is up to a 30 to 40 percent increase .
if we did get our own nunavut power corporation would we be able to correct this increase .

hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , the member if anything is persistent and with the same the same persistent questions , and i give full credit for that .
i have answered this question , i don &apos;t know how many different ways and different times .
i thank him for giving me the chance to answer this question for the 74,892 time .
just kidding .
just kidding .
so i hope that gives the member some level of comfort on this question .
again , thank you mr. chairman , and thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
do you understand his response mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i was just wondering if that is reflective of the actual dollar value of debt actually spent or incurred within the nunavut territory .
thank you mr. chairman
chairperson :
mr. picco
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , that is a good question .
what i can say to the member is the amount of debt that we would take a portion of is based on what we own which has been agreed to previously .
so our percentage of the debt is the percentage of ownership we have which is approximately 33 percent .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
also , there are problems in iqaluit right now with the increased capacity we are going to need to upgrade the facility there .
i &apos;m sure there are a number of old plants operating within nunavut right now that are going to need to be redone over the next little bit of time .
i guess i &apos;m just wondering if this long-term debt , is it our long-term debt , or was it debt from capital projects developed in the west over the number of years .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. picco
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman and thank you to the member for clarifying that .
for example , if you look at the power plant in baker lake maybe the capitalisation costs have been paid ten years ago which is the actual cost of putting that plant in place .
so you wouldn &apos;t be able to look at that as a long-term debt of the corporation because it has already paid for itself .
that would be very hard to figure out and that is one of the reasons that the debt itself is based on the share ownership east and west .
so in our case we take 33 percent of that debt .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , maybe the minister can correct me if i &apos;m wrong on determining the value of assets that we have .
once a plant is built it has a life expectancy of say 25 years and it depreciates every year .
so i guess i would like to take a look at that if there isn &apos;t a better way of doing it .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr chairman , the three step methodology is inclusive of and includes the capitalisation costs .
we think that the structure that is in place is fair to nunavut , that we take 33 % of the value of our share , we take the value of that debt .
again it has to follow the three-step methodology that is in place and we will have to take that into account so that we can make sure that is done correctly .
again that would be reviewed with the offices of the minister of finance to make sure that we weren &apos;t being short-changed , i &apos;m sure , as he looks at me inquisitively .
laura , would you like to add anything more to this .
mr. chairman , ms. gauthier would like to add to that .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
ms. gauthier .
ms. gauthier :
thank you , mr. chairman .
in hopes of maybe clarifying the three step methodology process , as much as i &apos;ve rehearsed it myself , to me it still seems fairly complex at times .
so we came to them for a methodology on how to split ntpc assets when it looked like we couldn &apos;t continue on a joint arrangement as part of those negotiations with the gnwt .
so , what this three step methodology really does is it separates all those physical assets east and west , so what &apos;s on the ground stays east and west .
those stranded assets so all of the power corporation that has been valued inside of nunavut will stay inside of nunavut and all of those in the west will stay where they are .
the next step sort of looks at those assets that you can &apos;t really divide on a geographic basis .
so that next level of how you get to that final formula , that &apos;s using that ratio that &apos;s identified in the transition agreement .
and then the third sort of category are those things that you really can &apos;t , they &apos;re sort of soft assets and liabilities that are fuzzy if you want to call it that .
and those are also using the formula that &apos;s set out in the transition agreement .
so that &apos;s just to help provide a bit more clarity to the actual methodology so that hopefully that will address mr. tootoo &apos;s question .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
is that it for comments .
comments .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
one last question , mr. chairman , just in regards to the rates .
you know there &apos;s a couple of pages in here on the rates .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. picco , possibly you want to respond to that .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
there are several options under rates that we could look at .
one would be the status quo that we have , basically what &apos;s there to stay in place , and uses the community based rate approach .
so we know there &apos;s a problem with that .
we could go to zones .
that &apos;s another option , that &apos;s called zones .
or we could look at what greenland does .
they have what &apos;s called a postage stamp rate .
that &apos;s one rate for everyone in the whole area .
so there are different things that could be looked at .
as a government , again we have to get the power corporation up and running .
we need consultation with the premier , through the public utilities board process .
there might be an opportunity there for setting rates and so on and so forth .
it is a complex issue .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
any further comments to the report .
are we agreed then . 45-1 ( 3 ) and 20-1 ( 24 ) i believe there &apos;s a mistake in here .

corrections planning committee report
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
members are aware that the nunavut corrections planning committee released it &apos;s final report last fall .
i provided each member with a copy of the report and i invited comments .
today i would like to inform you that the department of justice has been reviewing the committee &apos;s recommendations and has been preparing a plan to implement as many of the recommendations as possible .
in some cases we can act quickly .
for example , we are working to put in place three dedicated community corrections officers , who will supervise youth and adults with respect to probation , parole and conditional sentencing .
a program manager will also be hired .
this will allow more offenders to return to their home communities under properly supervised conditions .
in many cases up to now there has been no option except to keep these individuals in jail .
we need more resources to implement our complete community corrections plan .
but at least now we can make a start .
( interpretation ends ) other recommendations will take longer to put in place .
for example , the construction of a joint federal / territorial jail is being discussed with the federal government , but will not happen immediately .
the corrections planning committee stressed the need to ensure that corrections in nunavut is community based .
the baffin correctional centre is holding a number of offenders who should not be there .
many of the inmates at the bcc are low risk and will be able to heal and reintegrate into their communities , if we can provide the proper supervision and programs in the communities .
community corrections officers would not only work with offenders but with their spouses and families .
this way healing and reintegration can really happen .
my department is taking the recommendations of the corrections planning committee very seriously and we are moving in the right direction .
thank you , mr. speaker .

minister &apos;s statement 66 - 1 ( 3 ) :
change of name , status of women to qulliit council
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
today i stand because i want to give you the current status of the women &apos;s council in nunavut .
the council , which was officially appointed in october 1999 , met for the first time in iqaluit from february 1 to the 3rd .
they laid the groundwork of their initial plan and activities .
nine board members were appointed to the council .
( interpretation ends ) during this meeting rebecca kudloo was elected as the president , daisy keenainak and joan kalaserk were elected as vice presidents of the council .
congratulations to the new executive and i wish them well .
mr. speaker , this was the first meeting and the council accomplished many difficult tasks .
the members reviewed their mandate under the act and came up with a series of goals and objectives .
one of the critical issues they discussed was how to respond better to the needs of nunavummiut .
( interpretation ) the council also discussed the public image of the status of women due to the change to nunavut .
the status of women name has created some intimidation .
( interpretation ends ) the council discussed how to create equality between women and men .
the council made it very clear that they needed to support men in order to enhance inuit qaujimajatuqangit .
mr. speaker , the status of women has a new name , and from this day on they will be known as qulliit .
if you look at qulliit it can only work if both men and women take responsibility for its maintenance .
the man &apos;s job was to get the blubber for fuel .
the lighting and the maintenance of the light , warmth and other uses , is the responsibility of the woman .
let &apos;s give our support to qulliit as they move forward to represent the people of nunavut for a healthier and more equal way of life amongst our people .
thank you , mr. speaker .

item 3 : members &apos; statements
member &apos;s statement 139 - 1 ( 3 ) :
mobile treatment programs
mr. mclean :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , there are often many factors in a person &apos;s life that may have contributed to an addictive lifestyle .
experiences of children of sexual abuse , suicide , family violence , residential schools and grieving and loss that have gone without counselling and support .
mr. speaker , we appreciate the fact that the minister felt the treatment centre in apex cost too much per person .
but in the past there have been efforts to develop mobile treatment centre programs and grieving and healing programs that could be delivered in the community and on the land .
mobile programs can be developed in inuktitut and be delivered in the local dialect .
they can be more appropriate to the land based healing tradition in the inuit culture .
they can be targeted to youth , elders , women and men .
they can build on the work and capacity of local drug and alcohol committees .
communities across nunavut have often had to purchase such programs from southern providers .
before the treatment centre in apex was closed , they had held one mobile program in igloolik .
a consultant &apos;s report evaluating the centre recommended they increase their mobile treatment program .
thank you .

member &apos;s statement 140 - 1 ( 3 ) :
day care facility for gjoa haven
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my member &apos;s statement today is about day care in gjoa haven .
as a decentralised community we are very fortunate that new jobs are being created in gjoa haven .
we are working hard to ensure local people can get those jobs .
if people from my home community are to take up these new jobs they will need a safe , reliable day care program where they can take their kids when they go to work .
some of my constituents are planning to get training for these new jobs .
they will also need a day care so they can go to school .
right now there is no day care in gjoa haven .
however , mr. speaker they are very close to getting a new day care building in gjoa haven .
today , in my member &apos;s statement , i would like to outline the history of this project and make some suggestions on what needs to happen next .
several years ago our nutuktiyakangoik society tried to run a program out of a surplus building .
but they found that the old building could not be used because the building did not meet the health and safety requirements for a day care centre .
then our community found out about a program that could provide capital dollars .
that program was administered by pauktuutit - the national inuit women &apos;s organization , on behalf of the human resources department of the federal government .
we got approval from pauktuutit to take that approach .
a budget of 255 thousand was set and approval was given to purchase and deliver the materials , build the pad and design the modifications needed to meet day care standards .
the materials are now in our community and they have been sitting there for a year and a half .
unfortunately , it turned out the cost of the ventilation control . . .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. puqiqnak you have run out of time .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
mr. speaker , i would like unanimous consent to continue my statement .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. puqiqnak is asking for unanimous consent to finish his member &apos;s statement .
are there any nays .
thank you .
mr. puqiqnak , go ahead .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
however , the mechanical work on the centre will have to be done by an outside firm .
this will add a lot to the cost .
pauktuutit still has a just under 100 thousand dollars committed for this project through hrdc .
we fear that this funding may lapse on march 31 , 2000 .
pauktuutit no longer administers the program and the responsibility has been given to the kitikmeot economic development corporation who administers similar hrdc funding .
i understand that approximately 500 thousand is available to the kitikmeot area for childcare programs .
our challenge mr. speaker , is therefore to come up with 73 thousand dollars , which is needed to complete this project .
the building has been carefully designed to meet the special requirements of a day care .
it will be a perfect building for our needs .
kitikmeot development corporation has told the people of gjoa haven that they will have to contribute to the 73 thousand dollar cost for the extra plumbing and heating .
i understand the gjoa haven development corporation may be willing to contribute some of this cost , but cannot assume the full costs .
i would like to see that everyone gets together to take the final step to complete this project .
if each of these groups would commit , this would be just in time to assist people who would be seeking decentralised jobs or training , so they can obtain these jobs .
we have the building design .
the material has been paid for and delivered , and we need under 100 thousand dollars available to make the next steps happen .
to build this day care .

mr. tootoo
member &apos;s statement 142 - 1 ( 3 ) :
day care funding
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , as my constituency grows our community childcare facilities are facing growing pressures .
today there are 189 licensed childcare spaces available and six child care centres .
each of these centres are at capacity and have waiting lists of thirty to sixty children .
all are facing extreme financial pressures .
childcare workers are finding it almost impossible to find affordable housing .
all of the child care centres are finding it more and more difficult in recruiting and retaining qualified child care workers .
one of our centres caters to students .
the students experience difficulty qualifying and delays in receiving their day care subsidies .
also the department is not allowed to pay the subsidy directly to the centre on behalf of the students .
i would like to thank the minister of housing , the hon. manitok thompson for recently using creative approaches to assist the aakuluk day care centre to help them to remain solvent .
mr. speaker , i thank the minister of education for meeting recently with the iqaluit childcare association .
i am pleased he has agreed to review the concerns they presented to him .
i urge him to look for new ways to proceed or to provide accessible and affordable childcare in our communities .
i have some specific advice for him .
review and overhaul the childcare funding formula to make sure operations and maintenance dollars are adequate for current costs .
consider ways to enhance benefits for childcare workers through the formula .
revive early childhood education programs based on the co-operative model through arctic college .
this will reduce our dependence on childcare workers in the south .
review and streamline the process for approving subsidies for students .
allow subsidies to be paid directly to the child care centre with the consent of the student .
mr. speaker , when we are making maximum efforts to educate and employ inuit to work in our new government , those employees who have children are under increasing pressure to find childcare spaces .
something must be done or we will soon end up with less childcare spaces just when we need more .

recognition of baffin crisis line volunteers
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i wish today to speak to the counsellors because the counsellors , caregivers especially face very hard challenges in the communities .
i notice this especially when i live in iqaluit .
i would like to recognize the caregivers .
there is a crisis line which is open from 9-5 in iqaluit for the people who want to speak to somebody .
the nunavut crisis line started in 1989 .
at that time the cbc crew considered how they could help people prevent suicide .
they got together and they formed the baffin crisis line .
in inuktitut it is called kamatsiaqtut .
they use volunteers in the evening there are not too many volunteers , volunteers are needed .
i think we have to recognize these people who require assistance .
we have to recognize the volunteers too who are caregivers and they want to help the nunavut people very much .
they even help the people from outside of nunavut .
people from outside nunavut even call the baffin crisis line , the calls come in from whitehorse even , and we hardly recognize the baffin crisis line , the volunteers there .
i would like to recognize them , i respect them , especially sheila levy and harold fletcher who volunteer their services there .
i know that there are not too many volunteers there , and we need more volunteers at the baffin crisis line and they give themselves freely to help other people in nunavut and elsewhere .
i just want to recognize these people .

( interpretation ends ) oral questions .
mr. iqaqrialu .
question 224 - 1 ( 3 ) :
treatment centres in communities
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is directed to the ministers of health and social services , and justice .
mr. speaker , if you attend a court day and hear the cases in almost any community in nunavut , almost every criminal case has alcohol involved .
almost every case of violence has alcohol involved .
many cases of theft involve alcohol or stealing things in order to purchase alcohol or drugs .
bootlegging , being drunk in a public place and the list goes on .
mr. speaker , almost every lawyer and most judges wish there were programs to deal with this and quite often we have people requesting assistance .
mr. speaker , there are people that attend court and therefore , so many people end up in jail a long way from their home , family and community .
my question to the minister is , could there be a way to solve these needs .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister responsible for health , mr. picco .
mr. picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , it was quite a lengthy preamble to that question , could the member be more specific in his actual question .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. picco .
i will give the member an opportunity to rephrase his question .
please keep your preamble as brief as possible so we can get the question right away .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
with almost any kind of social problem the inmates who are incarcerated are sent down south .
possibly my question is , in our communities is it possible to build treatment centres in the communities .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. picco .
mr. picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , that is a good question .
so that is the kind of work that we are doing right now mr. speaker .
trying to build that capacity at the local level .
the apex treatment centre and the one member had a statement on it earlier today , and there were some questions on it yesterday , that model has not proved to be successful .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. picco .
mr. tootoo .
question 225 - 1 ( 3 ) :
justice programs at apex treatment centre
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question is to the minster responsible for health and social services .
mr. speaker , what i would like to ask the minister is exactly when did they submit the proposal to cabinet .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. picco .
mr. picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
so i can &apos;t actually say what the actual date was that any specific proposal was or was not actually brought forward to cabinet .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
oral questions .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i guess i was just wondering , in the fall it had been reported that there was a proposal submitted in september and they are just waiting for cabinet .
a proposal was waiting for cabinet approval in september .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister responsible for health , mr. picco .
mr. picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
there has been no proposal brought forward to cabinet about the usage of the apex treatment centre .

thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister responsible for health , mr. picco .
mr. picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , maybe the concern is what is being reported in the media and so on .
there has been no proposal brought forward to cabinet on the usage of the treatment centre in apex .
so i hope that helps answer the member &apos;s question .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :

thank you mr. tootoo .
minister responsible for health , mr. picco .
mr. picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
there have been discussions by the department of health with other groups by the way in the community of iqaluit to see what the best usage for the treatment facility is .
those things haven &apos;t occurred yet .
so the discussions are at the senior level of government and when a decision is made , then that decision will be announced .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. picco .
oral questions .
mr. kattuk .
question 226 - 1 ( 3 ) :
treatment programs for inmates
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is one i brought up earlier regarding corrections for individuals that are sent to jail .
we have heard that the treatment centre was being closed in nunavut , and in other areas .
my question is that i just want to get an update as to what they are doing with the treatment centres .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak . mr. kattuk .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. anawak , minister for justice .
hon. jack anawak : i cannot really say what programs are available .
ron mccormick is the individual that is working on this and it is not just counselling services for the correctional centres .
we are trying to think of ways to improve counselling in all areas . but we are working on this currently .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr anawak .
mr. akesuk .
question 227 - 1 ( 3 ) :
overcrowding and safety in schools
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is directed to the minister of education .
the schools in the communities are very over crowded , not just in cape dorset or kimmirut but in all communities the schools are overcrowded .
they don &apos;t have enough space to hold their classes and i &apos;m wondering if we are breaking any safety regulations like the fire safety regulations , because the classrooms are overcrowded .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. arvaluk , minister for education .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
mr. speaker , these have been reviewed by the fire marshals and they do often work with representatives from education , and health services are often doing reviews of any safety hazards .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
oral questions .
mr. iqaqrialu .
question 228 - 1 ( 3 ) :
update on clam diving project in clyde river
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i have a question for the minister of sustainable development .
my question has to do with a broughton island issue if there has been something done about that item .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
perhaps mr. iqaqrialu , you could rephrase your question so the minister can understand it .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
mr. speaker , we are often told to make our questions short but when i do this i &apos;m often told to rephrase my question .
my question has to do with the clam diving project . what has happened .
can i get an update on what they are doing with that .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
minister for sustainable development , mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
mr. speaker i will be very brief .
in nunavut , clam diving projects number about sixteen individuals who have the certificate for diving .
when the clam diving project goes ahead they need to make sure the divers have a higher level - a level 2 diving certificate in order for them to go ahead .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
oral questions .
mr. irqittuq .
question 229 - 1 ( 3 ) :
home care for new born children
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
my question is directed to the minister of health and social services .
in my constituency of igloolik there is a woman who gave premature birth and the baby could not suckle so they fed the baby intravenously so there would be normal development of the baby .
the mother was taught how she should handle her premature baby .
the husband was not happy with the process .
my question , does the department of health provide training to a parent and then is the parent required to provide that special care to the child .
speaker :
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
so i &apos;m not aware of the exact case that the member is taking about .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. picco .

mr. alakannuark .
question 230 - 1 ( 3 ) :
repairs to public housing unit , repulse bay
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
my question is for the minister responsible for housing .
in repulse bay , i would like to know if there is going to be a housing review done for that community .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
minister responsible for housing , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
are you talking about the private homeownership program or the social housing , or are you talking about contractors that construct these houses .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. thompson .
mr. alakannuark i will give you another chance to rephrase your question please .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
social housing .
thank you , mr. speaker
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
minister responsible for housing .
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i understand your question .
this is a question that was brought up in our session in iqaluit and we dealt with it right away on the day you asked that question .
i called vitaline depateie , who works for the housing corporation and she called your community and told them to correct the problem that was occurring in repulse bay .
they worked directly with the local housing authority to rectify the matter .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. thompson .
oral questions .
mr. tootoo .
question 231 - 1 ( 3 ) :
nunavut seat on canada post board and council
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question is directed to the premier .
mr speaker , last spring i asked the premier in regards to the outrageous increase in postal rates , if nunavut had a representative on the canada post board .
i would like to ask the premier at this time if he is able to provide me with an update on that .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. premier , mr. okalik .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i &apos;m not clear on what the question is .
is it the board , or the canada post council , because there are different boards and councils for canada post , i just want a clarification .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
mr. tootoo please rephrase your question .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to thank the premier for clarifying that .
so , does nunavut have anyone , whether it is on the canada post board or canada post council that can represent the interests of nunavummiut at that level .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you , mr. speaker .
as of today there are two boards .
the first one is the northern postal service customer council , which is an advisory council and mr. david simailak from baker lake is a member of that council .
however , the body that really determines the operation of that crown corporation is the board of directors and currently there is no representative from northern canada .
each region of the country is represented on the board of directors for the crown corporation .
so i share the concern of the member and will forthwith write a letter to the prime minister requesting membership on the board of directors for a representative from northern canada .
i will be raising the matter with my colleagues from northern canada in whitehorse next week .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr premier .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i would like to thank the premier for taking this issue and running with it and i wish him the best of luck .
mr. speaker , i heard on the news over the last couple of days that there have been representatives from canada post touring northern communities to hear views and concerns of the residents .
mr. speaker , i am wondering if the premier would try and ensure that these representatives hold some type of public hearings or meetings in nunavut and not just in northern quebec .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr premier .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you , mr. speaker .
so i invite anyone from nunavut to take part in this hearing .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to ask the premier if we could try and have this council come to iqaluit and hold some hearings there as well .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. okalik .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you , mr. speaker .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. okalik .
mr. tootoo , final supplementary .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , one other thing i would like to ask is i understand that it is not our council and we don &apos;t have any control over where they meet .
mr. speaker , i know the cost of travel here , a round trip from rankin to iqaluit is probably over two thousand dollars .
mr. speaker , if someone wants to attend and intervene in this meeting for the average person it is almost impossible because of the cost .
i &apos;m wondering mr. speaker , if they choose not to hold meetings in other locations in nunavut will there be some way in subsidising people that wish to attend that meeting .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. okalik
hon. paul okalik :
as i stated in my prior answer we will try to ask the council to hold hearings in iqaluit for example .
perhaps elsewhere but i &apos;m not aware of any funding provided for intervenor status to travel to another community for canada post .
i &apos;m sure written submissions will also be accepted .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
mr. o &apos;brien .
question 232 - 1 ( 3 ) :
update on task force on housing
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question is to the minister responsible for housing .
i would like the minister to update the house on the status of the report that is being compiled by the task force on housing .
thank you
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister responsible for housing , ms. manitok thompson .
ms. thompson :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the task force as you know was created october 1st and their mandate was going to finish at the end of march .
the housing task force still has meetings .
their finish date was march and we haven &apos;t seen the final report or recommendation , because they are still meeting .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you ms. thompson .
reminder to the minister , we do have interpreters , so you don &apos;t need to repeat your answer in inuktitut .

mr. o &apos;brien :

speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister responsible for housing , ms. thompson .
ms. thompson :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , as you know we have not discussed the budget yet and therefore , that is a budget item and i cannot speak to it at this time .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you ms. thompson .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i &apos;m not referring to the budget .
we have spoken openly here in the house about the projected surplus , it is well documented in the media , that we all know .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
two questions .
minister responsible for housing , ms. thompson .
ms. thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i know that there has been a great concern about housing since the nunavut government was established .
i know that there are many people who are quite concerned about the housing crisis , and i know that it is the nunavut government &apos;s priority , housing is their priority .
if we did have a projected surplus , i know that we are very concerned about housing , but the projected surplus will only be used in next year &apos;s budget .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. thompson .
mr. kattuk .
question 233 - 1 ( 3 ) :
nunavut involvement in gun control challenge
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is in regards to gun control and if the nunavut government is involved .
the response i got was that the nunavut government has no jurisdiction over gun control .
so therefore , i would like to ask the premier if the nunavut government is going to be involved in the gun control issue with the federal government .
speaker :
thank you mr. kattuk .
mr. okalik .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
this court case now is only for provinces and nunavut is not a province , and we don &apos;t have that kind of jurisdiction , so therefore we were unable to participate .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
do i understand then the territories have less authority and power than provinces .
is that why we are not involved .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kattuk .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
but we were too late because the nunavut government was not established at that time .
so therefore , we were unable to take part in the presentation of evidence and voice our concerns .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
mr. okalik .
oral questions .
mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
perhaps it &apos;s not a question but i want to get clarification because the inuit people have been surviving by using rifles .
they have been using rifles for survival , and with all the legislation , it hinders the hunters , and some of the regulations hinder our very way of life .
so therefore , the nunavut government should be involved .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kattuk .
mr. okalik , government premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
as i have stated before , this was dealt with before the nunavut government was established , and it was in the courts before nunavut was established .
we were unable to be involved , if there is going to be another court case like that in the future we are going to be involved .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier , mr. okalik .

mr. iqaqrialu .
question 234 - 1 ( 3 ) :
funding for cultural instructors
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question was directed to the minister of culture , language , elders &amp; youth yesterday .
i would like to ask that question now .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu . minister responsible for culture , language , elders &amp; youth .
mr. havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i thank you mr. iqaqrialu , for your question so the people can be informed .
we also talked about this week that we will be dealing with the elders and youth for them to work together .
but again , let me mention that the money that we will be providing for the programs is for each community .
i would like input from each community in regards to this .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. havioyak .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the elders don &apos;t even know how to fill out application forms , and you were talking about giving contributions when they apply through application forms .
if that is going to go that way , it is going to hinder the elders because they have no way of applying .
they can &apos;t fill out application forms , why can &apos;t you just contribute this funding to the communities and get directors in each community .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. havioyak , minister responsible for culture , language , elders &amp; youth .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
this issue will be ongoing .
if you wish to fill out an application form to apply for funding , you can go to our department for assistance .
so , i would like to inform the member that there are government staff that can help .
when the elders had their conference in october , i stated that the elders and youth can help each other in promoting the culture in the communities .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. havioyak .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
if it is going to remain that way there are going to be people who can fill out application forms and there are other people who cannot fill out application forms .
with the gnwt we always had to apply for funding through application forms , it seems like it is not going to change here in the nunavut government .
as nunavut residents we have to find ways to help people .
i think it is time we help people as the nunavut government .
i was wondering if you are willing to give the funding to the communities directly .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister responsible for culture , language , elders &amp; youth .
mr. havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
i think the whole nunavut , we are trying to help our communities .
that is my job .
i want to help whoever applies for funding from other communities , so we could know what they are asking for , what kind of programs .
that is how i want to give contributions .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. havioyak .
your last supplementary , mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
if that is going to be the case i will not be happy about it .

speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of finance . mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , no , the simple answer is no .
no departments have been told not to spend any money , they have to continue to operate and to provide services for the constituents throughout nunavut that we all represent .
and as i indicated , our projected surplus is a projected surplus as it stands now .
so , i mean , factors are already taken into consideration as far as what the expected expenditures would be up until march 31st .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .

mr. speaker , once again , i will say that it is a projected surplus .
we expect , our estimates are that there will be a surplus on march 31st .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i guess mr. speaker and the minister can correct me if i &apos;m wrong , a supplementary appropriation is a change in any budgeted amount that has already been approved by this house .
there is a little bit of room to manoeuvre there .
i was wondering if those departments that we said are a priority of cabinet , and they said it , why can &apos;t we do something with those funds this year .
thank you , mr. speaker .

item 19 :
consideration in committee of the whole of bills and other matters
chairperson ( mr. puqiqnak ) ( interpretation ) :
this seat is very low .
what is the wish of the committee .
lunch is ready for the members , what is the wish of the committee .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman i would like to take a 1 hour break .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
we will return at a quarter to one .
members you are free to go .
&gt; &gt; committee recessed at 11 : 50 a.m. and resumed at 12 : 45 p.m.
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you very much .
our sound is back and since today is friday , during committee of the whole , i would like everything to proceed as smoothly as possible .
first of all i would like to ask you what you would like to do at this time .
what &apos;s the committee &apos;s wish .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman the members would like to proceed with bill 9 , an act to amend the judicature act and other acts in relation to judges .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
okay then , we deal with bill 9 , an act to amend the judicature act and other acts in relation to judges . agreed .
okay , bill 9 , an act to amend the judicature act and other acts in relation to judges . we &apos;ll be dealing with bill 9 today .
the minister of justice could say his opening comments mr. anawak . bill 9 - an act to amend the judicature act and other acts in relation to judges - consideration in committee
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
it &apos;s okay , we &apos;re all inuit .
just call me jack .
thank you , mr. chairman .
this proposed bill amends the judicature act to provide for the nunavut court of justice to be headed by a chief justice rather than the senior judge .
as an inuk there is not much of a difference between the word chief justice and senior judge .
in the provinces , the head of the trial court is a chief justice , however in the three territories , this is not the case .
instead of a chief justice , we have a senior administrative judge who is the senior person in the administrative level .
chief justices are appointed as chief justices while a senior judge is the judge who has been a judge for the longest period of time .
the chief justices are appointed from anywhere , from the public .
these changes require federal legislation as well as territorial legislation .
under the constitution , all our judges are federally appointed .
as well , i have spoken to the federal minister of justice about this .
this bill makes the necessary changes to nunavut &apos;s laws .
those changes would not be brought into force until the necessary federal changes are also made .
the nwt has also changed legislation to change to a chief justice . their amendments are not in force yet .
they also would be brought into force when the federal changes are made in both the nunavut and territorial cases .
( interpretation ends ) the second change the bill makes is more minor . currently judges of the court of appeal can be sworn in by judges of the nunavut court of justice .
this will make our law the same as the northwest territories .
( interpretation ) thank you , mr. speaker .
i could go up to the witness chair .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister , mr. anawak .
i believe that there are some comments to be made .
mr. o &apos;brien , i believe you have a comment to make before the minister goes up to the witness table .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , the standing committee on community empowerment and sustainable development has reviewed bill 9 , an act to amend the judicature act and other acts in relation to judges .
yesterday the committee had the pleasure of meeting with the minister of justice and his officials to discuss this bill .
mr. chairman , while i do have a few questions regarding the bill , for the most part it is very straightforward , the committee is very comfortable with it .
for the most part , i think we &apos;d like to see this bill go through in a very efficient manner .
so i do have a few questions although the minister did touch on a few of some of the questions that i have in his statement .
for the record , i &apos;d like to direct my question to the minister while he is in the witness chair .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
the minister and his officials can go up to the witness table .
i will give you the opportunity .
thank you .
mr. minister , if you would introduce your officials to the rest of the members please .
hon. jack anawak :
mark spakowski , who is our legal advisor with the department of justice .
he &apos;ll be here with me .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
questions or comments to bill 9 .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
minister , you &apos;ve indicated that there has to be some changes at the federal level in order for this bill to take full effect .
can you tell the members if these changes at the federal level do not take place , what impact will that have on the name change .
chairperson :
mr. minister .
hon. jack anawak :
however if for some reason it was not to go through then really , this law would remain until such time as the federal government tabled .
as i mentioned earlier , the northwest territories has done this and is just awaiting the federal legislation to change to start calling their senior judges chief justice .
qujannamiik .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
minister , so it &apos;s safe to say that until the federal government makes their amendments , what we &apos;re doing here cannot come into force until those amendments are made .
having said that , do you have any idea as to what the timing is for these changes is .
we know that in some cases it could take years to get something through the house of commons .
do you have any idea as to the time frame .
chairperson :
mr. minister .
hon. jack anawak :
thank you mr. chairman .
at the same time , just let me say that if for some reason the federal government did not move soon , then our act would just remain there until that time .
as i said , i &apos;m quite confident that the necessary changes will be made .
again , because this is a relatively minor change .
qujannamiik .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
just one more question .
minister , once all the t &apos;s are crossed and the i &apos;s are dotted , we &apos;re going to move on this then you get to the actual selection of the chief justice .
how will that individual be selected .
will it be on seniority or at the discretion of the federal government .
and the reason i bring the question forward , that if it &apos;s on seniority , you may not necessarily get the best person for the job as far as suitability .
so , my question is , how will the decision be made .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. minister .
hon. jack anawak :
as i pointed out , the chief justices are appointed as chief justices , not as the senior judge of which ever jurisdiction .
so i &apos;m quite confident that in consultation , the federal government in consultation of course with the department of justice of nunavut would select whoever the chief justice was going to be .
however i should point out that at this time , if this thing were to go through today , the senior judge of nunavut would be designated as chief .
i would also recommend that as well at this time .
as i said , if this were to go through now , it would be the senior judge of nunavut going on to become the chief justice .
qujannamiik .

thank you mr. minister .

jp &apos;s of the communities will then be under the chief justice .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. minister .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
no .
the jps are appointed by us but the communities make a recommendation to us before we appoint that jp .
what it says here is that the chief justice is responsible for the supervision , they won &apos;t do the appointing .
they would only be responsible for the supervision .

minister &apos;s statement 50-1 ( 3 ) regarding the fuel price increases . comments .
general comments .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i &apos;m wondering if the minister has anything as far as opening remarks to say to this or is she prepared to go to the witness table with some of her staff .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
madame minister , do you have any opening remarks .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i could go right away to the witness table .
i don &apos;t have any other comments to make in regards to the increase in fuel prices .
there &apos;s some very technical information so i would like to ask one of my officials to come sit with me at the witness table .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
do you agree .
the minister can go to the witness table along with her officials .
thank you .
before we begin i would like to recognize someone in the gallery .
we have a guest here today , author michael kusugak .
he is a well known artist and writer throughout nunavut , canada and the world .
he has also been instrumental and supportive to the school curriculum , therefore , i would like to recognize mike kusugak from us as the nunavut government .
thank you .
minister thompson if you can introduce your official for the record .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
my official is from the petroleum products division , finance comptroller , roy green .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
general comments to the minister &apos;s department .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , in the minister &apos;s statement that was tabled , she had mentioned the price stabilization fund in there of 5 million dollars .
i would just like maybe to ask the minister if she or her staff could clarify how this fund works .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo . minister .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i would like mr. green to answer most of the questions for this is quite technical , if the members would allow me to .
chairperson :
mr. green .
mr. green :
the limit was established at a maximum allowable limit of plus or minus 5 million dollars .
chairperson ( mr. irqittuq ) :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , mr. green indicated how it is set up and how it works .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. green .
mr. green :
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
hunter
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
and i wonder if he could indicate how they came up with that amount of 5 million dollars .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. green .
mr. green :
it is something we have been operating with for the past 27 years .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i see this , maybe if i &apos;m wrong , or could be corrected , is basically like a subsidy fund that has been in place since 1972 .
i would imagine , i know things have changed a little since 1972 as far as cost of living , and everything has gone up .
i am wondering why , or if , the department is taking a look at increasing it , or hasn &apos;t taken a look at increasing that amount .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. green .
mr. green :
petroleum products have been able to live within the stabilization fund for the most part for the past 10 years or so .
in order to clarify the stabilization fund , a little bit of terminology , so people can really understand basically what it is .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , as i said , mr. green &apos;s comments kind of lead into my next question .
is this stabilization fund is what &apos;s enabled the department to maintain the prices that are out there , charged to the public for fuel .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. green .
mr. green :
thank you mr. chairman .
at division the balance of the stabilization fund was at it &apos;s maximum limit of 5 million dollars .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
so basically what you are saying is that , if we would have raised the stabilization fund from 5 million to 7 million dollars , the prices could have stayed the same .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. green .
mr. green :
thank you mr. chairman .
that is correct .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
was that an option that was looked at or not , prior to increasing the prices and if it wasn &apos;t why .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. green .
mr. green :
thank you mr. chairman .
it was one of the options that we looked at .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i don &apos;t know what stopped .
the reason for that was to meet the needs that are out there .
chairperson :
mr. green .
mr. green :
thank you mr. chairman .
so what we did do is we looked at the overall subsidies of products that were being subsidized .
but when we looked at the stabilization fund we were looking at what it could sustain for this year and what impact the 5 cent increase would have on the next fiscal year .
so at that point in time that is how we decided to proceed with the 5 cent increase .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
my last one for now is , i guess who has , just in simple terms , who has the authority to change that amount of the stabilization fund .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
if there are any amendments that need to be done or changes , i think the members are aware that it could be done through the members , through the legislative assembly .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
the prices i think are the highest in our community and they complain about not having enough money for hunting , food or grub , and this a big concern in our community .
my question is how can the hunters be assisted or subsidized with the fuel increases being implemented .
chairperson :
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
we feel for the hunters , but it has been implemented , it had to be done .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
this isn &apos;t really a question it is a comment from the hamlets .
i understand that the hamlets are concerned about homeowners .
they have to pay for electricity , fuel and insurance and they have to pay for mortgages .
when a person is a homeowner there are a lot of expenses that have to be paid .
i &apos;m just concerned about them because with this fuel price increase i know it will effect them .
this is mainly a comment .
with prices being so high in the north it is very hard to keep up sometimes in paying expenses .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
any comments or responses , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
i think he stated it was a comment , and i understand what he is saying .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i think this question was brought up earlier but i didn &apos;t really understand the response .
the question was , who implements the fuel price increases .
that &apos;s my question , i didn &apos;t really understand the response earlier .
chairperson :
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
the fuel price increases are made through the fmb .
when the minister &apos;s cabinet is dealing with the budget they are called the fmb .
there was a global fuel price increase and when this happens it is approved by the fmb .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i think i understand the response now .
as a minister you are the ones that have implemented the fuel price increases following the global fuel price increase .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
fuel increases have been implemented all over the world .
you understood my response and that &apos;s correct .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
while you are dealing with this issue in the years to come it seemed that this was implemented without any consultation with the regular members .
in the years to come is that the way the cabinet is going to work , without getting any input from the regular members .
chairperson :
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
are we going to be informed about these things without having any input from the members .
chairperson :
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
if that is increased or if there were more funds that could be used or put into that fund , the members could look at finding more funds from different departments .
that would be one way to increase the fund .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
as members of the legislative assembly , we are going to have to work together to make sure that these changes are done properly .
that &apos;s just a comment we are going to need to communicate with each other to ensure these regulations are done properly .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i will give the minister of finance a chance to respond . mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
it wasn &apos;t in response to the question .
i was considering raising a point of order , mr. chairman , but i won &apos;t .
what i wanted to do was raise a question on a comment that mr. hunter made earlier .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo would you like to respond .
we are running out of time and i will give mr. tootoo a chance to speak but there are other members that haven &apos;t had a chance .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
as mr. kelvin knows that if departments go over they can come forward with a supplementary appropriation after the fact to make up for those over expenditures .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. ng .
point of order
hon. kelvin ng :
point of order , mr. chairman .
the honourable member referred to me as mr. kelvin on two occasions .
i don &apos;t know if it was intentional or not , but i will ask that he properly address all members of this house .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
in the house i would like to remind all members that we cannot use the first name of a person , please keep in mind that we address members by their surnames .
mr. tootoo .
point of order
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
then i too would like to raise a point of order that the honourable member for cambridge bay referred to me by my first name earlier as well .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i am sure that everything is okay now since both of you have raised points of order .
at this time we will have mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na , mr. chairman .
so if i ask a question , it &apos;s because of my ignorance , not because i am trying to be smart .
thank you mr. chairman .
but continuing on , my questions are just simple questions that i think should be easy .
when we purchase fuel , do we go to one wholesale supplier for a bulk purchase of fuel from one supplier , or is it bought from two or three suppliers .
chairperson :
mr. green .
mr. green :
thank you mr. chairman .
we had a three year contract signed with ntcl to buy the bulk fuel for the government of nunavut .
so this contract doesn &apos;t expire until october 15 , 2001 .
so this was the first year of the three year contract , wherein ntcl purchases and transports the fuel into nunavut .
chairperson :
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. chairman .
do they deliver fuel to every community in nunavut .
do they have the contract for every community in nunavut .
chairperson :
mr. green .
mr. green :
thank you mr. chairman .
yes they do .
chairperson :
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
if they have a three year contract does that include the purchasing of it .
chairperson :
mr. green .
mr. green :
thank you mr. chairman .
the contract with ntcl is to purchase and to transport the fuel into the communities for the next three years .
basically what happens is that we now know what the transportation costs will be for the next two years of this contract .
chairperson :
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na itsivautaq .
so the difference in the fuel contracts would be on the freight delivery .
chairperson :
mr. green .
mr. green :
thank you mr. chairman .
that statement is correct .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
anything else mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
no .
just ballpark this figure .
what is the average cost per litre for delivery in nunavut .
i know it is different in pelly bay and in arctic bay and arviat , but what is the per litre cost for delivery of fuel into nunavut .
chairperson :
mr. green .
mr. green :
thank you mr. chairman .
but if you include the bulk sales to iqaluit then the baffin region would be 16 cents a litre .
chairperson ( mr. puqiqnak ) ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
is that why the high cost compared to the 13 cents a litre here in the keewatin .
mr. green :
that is a correct statement .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
please recognize the chair if you are going to be making comments .
it is very hard to go through the chairperson but in order to carry out our proceedings , please recognize the chair before you make any comments .
i would appreciate that .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na itsivautaq .
when you talk about 13 cents a litre into the keewatin , does that include the freight from winnipeg to churchill in that price or is it brought around via montreal .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. green .
mr. green :
thank you mr. chairman .
that includes the route charges as well . so basically the 13 cents in the keewatin is from churchill into the keewatin region .
chairperson :
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na itsivautaq .
i was rudely interrupted by my colleague across the house there and i misunderstood the answer .
so you said that it is 13 cents a litre from churchill into the keewatin .
what &apos;s the rail charge from winnipeg to churchill , do you know .
chairperson :
mr. green .
mr. green :
thank you mr. chairman .
the rail freight is 4 cents a litre .
chairperson :
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na itsivautaq .
that &apos;s good information .
there &apos;s one other question that i have and i have a few more so i would like to thank my colleagues for letting me ask .
what &apos;s the administration costs , roughly , in the neighbourhood , i don &apos;t need it down to the dollar , for administering pol in nunavut .
like what are the head office charges for administration .
chairperson :
mr. green .
mr. green :
thank you mr. chairman .
the headquarters , finance and administration costs are 2 million dollars .
so it &apos;s around close to 5.5 million dollars in headquarters expense .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
i would like to inform the members here that we will be recessing here at 2 o &apos;clock and it is now 2 o &apos;clock .
at this time i would like to thank the two officials who have been here and ask the speaker to return to the chair .

ministers &apos; statements
minister &apos;s statement 67 - 1 ( 3 ) :
mining in nunavut
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i want to speak today on a topic of great interest to the people of the kivalliq , but also of interest to many communities in nunavut .
that topic is the development of resource minerals .
presently the mining industry in nunavut consists of two zinc mines , nanisivik and polaris , which employ 430 people and generate revenues of 225 million dollars a year .
the lupine gold mine is expected to reopen in the coming months and employ an additional 325 people .
they may not be all inuit people but there will be 325 people employed .
over the past two years 125 million dollars has been invested by the private sector in exploration for minerals in nunavut .
mr. speaker , a number of developments have resulted in making nunavut one of the best regions in the world for investment in mineral exploration .
the signing of the 1993 nunavut land claims agreement and the creation of the nunavut government has lead to great interest and excitement in the mining world about the potential that exists in nunavut .
this year we increased funding to the nunavut prospectors program to invest in the most important source of early information on mineral deposits .
in september in partnership with the government of canada we opened the canada / nunavut geo-science centre , which will build an information base on which investment decisions will be made in nunavut .
next week i will be participating in the prospectors and developers annual conference in toronto where nunavut will have its own trade show booth .
i will be able to meet with the investors .
some of the mineral projects have been discovered recently and nunavut showed tremendous potential here in the kivalliq region .
here in the kivalliq region the meladine and meadowbank projects show great potential .
the question we now must ask ourselves is , are we ready to take full advantage of these opportunities .
the participation of nunavummiut in the mining and mining related jobs is presently quite low .
to achieve these goals we need above all to work with industry and inuit organizations .
thank you , mr. speaker .

minister &apos;s statement 68 - 1 ( 3 ) :
justice of the peace training
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
last october i reported that the department of justice was about to start a training program for justices of the peace .
i am pleased to tell you today that our justice of the peace administrator , mr. neil sharkey , held intensive training sessions for jps in november and december .
he continues to train on a one on one basis and has organised more sessions for march and april .
it is important to ensure that we have enough jps in our communities to carry out the work .
presently we have 53 active jps throughout the territory . we also have 17 inactive jps who are still qualified but who are taking a break from their duties for one reason or another .
there are jps in 24 communities . however all 28 communities in nunavut are served because some jps travel as required .
there are 10 new applications from individuals wishing to become jps , and the chief judge will be deciding on these soon .
we are doing very well in terms of our numbers , but we must continue to recruit new jps in the communities to ensure that we have full coverage of all communities .
our goal between now and 2002 is to have a total of 100 active jps in nunavut .
this would allow us to have three in each of the 25 smaller communities and another 25 who would be divided among the three larger centres of rankin inlet , cambridge bay and iqaluit .
it is important to have at least three jps in the communities for a number of reasons .
first , we need to be sure that there is always a jp available .
second , so it will be possible to sit together and hear cases .
supporting each other is important and sometimes two heads are better than one .
third , having at least three jps in communities will help to avoid conflicts where a jp might be asked to preside over a case involving a relative as the accused or victim .
recruitment of new jps is an important task and neil sharkey has made it his priority this year along with training .
for example , he was recently in rankin inlet to discuss jp recruitment with the community .
he is working closely with chief judge brown on this .
as new jps are recruited they are assessed for their training needs and then trained by mr. sharkey and others .
in order to assist the process , mr. sharkey is producing a new training manual for nunavut jps that will ready in march .
finally , i will say that our priority is to hire inuktitut speaking jps .
mr. speaker , i am pleased to tell the members that our justice of the peace recruitment and training program is making good progress towards its goals .
thank you , mr. speaker .

staffing capacity and iep update
hon. kelvin ng :
mr. speaker , i raise today to update members of the legislative assembly with the third quarter staffing capacity and inuit employment statistics within the nunavut government .
overall mr. speaker , our inuit employment rate is 44 percent .
since i last updated this house in october , our overall capacity has increased by 2 percent .
in the nunavut government departments staffing capacity has increased to fifty-nine percent with an inuit employment rate of forty-two percent .
based on the data we received capacity in the boards and agencies decreased slightly to eighty-seven percent with an inuit employment rate of forty-six percent .
mr. speaker , our staffing has been aggressive in initiating ninety-eight competitions during this quarter representing an increase over the previous two quarters .
our inuit employment plan is designed to specifically target training programs to prepare inuit for nunavut government jobs .
later on today mr. speaker , i will be tabling these statistics and our government &apos;s inuit employment plan in the house so that all members may review it .
in closing mr. speaker , i believe that if we all work together on a common goal , we can have a government that is representative of the people it serves .

mla &apos;s trip to repulse bay
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
today i rise to report to you that we went to repulse bay with my colleagues and i &apos;m glad some of the members of the legislative assembly could make it to repulse bay .
i &apos;m very happy they came along with me and i would like to thank premier okalik and minister jack anawak for coming to our community .
later i started thinking when we got close to repulse bay that all of us were inuit members and i was so proud and happy about that .
there was not even one qallunaaq although i &apos;m not against qallunaaq .
i would like to apologise to our minister of health and social services because there was no room for him on the plane .
i &apos;m very sorry about that and perhaps some time in the future i would like to go to repulse and pelly bay with the minister .
also the hospitality was great in repulse bay and once we landed there we went to the hotel and then to the school gymnasium .
they had a feast waiting for us . everything was well prepared for us well ahead of time and the people were happy to see us .
you could really see it in their faces that they were happy to see us .
after that in the evening we went to the community hall and all the members came along and the hospitality was great .
the hamlet council was incredible and i would like to thank all the inuit people of repulse bay .

baffin leaders summit in hall beach
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i rise today to tell you of the baffin island leaders meeting held december 6 to 9 , 1999 .
my home community of hall beach was very pleased to be the host of the baffin leaders summit .
i would like to thank the baffin leaders for choosing hall beach for its meeting , and thank the community and the hamlet for welcoming the leaders .
also , i would like to thank the cabinet ministers who attended the meeting including premier paul okalik and minister ed picco , minister james arvaluk and minister donald havioyak .
i would like to extend my thank you , although some of you only stayed for half the day .
mr. speaker , we had a very good meeting and later today i will be tabling twenty-three resolutions passed at the leaders summit .
they cover a broad range of subjects from transportation to health care .
i would like to mention motion number eleven about ongoing support for the baffin leader summit .
the motion points out that it is not clear who is responsible for providing ongoing support of the baffin leaders summit .
we have to get this co-ordinated and find out who will be providing support .
motion number eleven makes that statement .
previously the department of community government has helped organise and provide follow-up for the leaders &apos; summit .
in motion eleven the baffin leaders summit recommended that funding be provided for the baffin leaders summit .
they made a motion that the next meeting would be held in may .

mr. speaker , i rise today to talk about why the nunavut government was established .
our nunavut government was established for that very reason , mr. speaker .
i stand today because the elders are dying at a rapid pace and they have to apply for funding .
our elders &apos; programs have to be applied for and still the government is not changing its mind .
mr. speaker , i will be asking a question during the oral question period to the minister of culture , language , elders and youth .
i think they can change this policy .
mr. speaker , this is very important to us .
we should amend the policy so the elders won &apos;t have to apply for funding . as soon as possible .

cost of private housing
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker i rise today to point out a concern from my community of sanikiluaq .
it is in regards to access to private housing that is provided to my community .
today it is very hard to operate and maintain a private home with the cost of living rising .
i can use a few examples of monthly expenses .
when you have an access home your payments are dependent on your salary .
you also pay for your oil and heating , water , your telephone and for other monthly expenses .
mr. speaker , the inuit who are employed need support and the reason they applied for the funding was because they wanted to help themselves .
but they need to have support also because they want to go hunting not only for their family but their whole community .
it is very important for the nunavut government to do this because i &apos;m representing the people of my community and also i will be asking this same question during oral question period .

thank you , mr. speaker .
first of all i would like to thank the member for akulliq who gave us the opportunity to go to repulse bay .
however today i want to talk about life in rankin inlet .
most of the communities in nunavut are original communities , with very few newer residents from the outside .
however , rankin inlet and iqaluit are where there are people from all over the country .
rankin inlet was established as a mining town .
we are very pleased that we have it very well co-ordinated .
there are still some miners in town , and i &apos;m very glad our town could be well established even though we have all kinds of people from all over the keewatin region .
we are very proud of the people who live here in rankin inlet , and there were some people who first came here when rankin inlet was starting to get established in mining .
there are quite a few of them here even though the mine closed a long time ago .
they went through very hard times but were able to get back on their feet again .
it was very hard for them when the mine closed down but we were able to keep the community going .
there are a lot of private businesses that were established in our town .
i just wanted to make that statement to say how proud i am of rankin inlet .

today mr. speaker , i would like to talk about the youth .
as parents we all know and worry about our young people as to where they go at night .
i know we all feel that as parents .
we worry about our young people and we know our young people need recreational facilities and they need counselling facilities .
i would like to acknowledge a private facility called aupaluktuq qullak and kativik , right across form the catholic church .
mr. speaker , or young people can hang out in these facilities where they won &apos;t get bored .
mr. speaker , it is evident that the parents have to spend money on their children because their children want to spend money in these places .
but these places i just mentioned have rules like no smoking , drugs or alcohol . the young people who are in school have a curfew time .
i would like to acknowledge these facilities for helping the young people so that the young people could have places to hang out .

in my communities many people are trying to survive through handicrafts and carvings .
the soapstone mine is quite far from our communities .
it is very hard to go and get a job at the mining campsite .
it is unsafe .
this coming summer there will be inuit people working in the mine .
we need to rectify the matter with the minster of sustainable development .
i would like to invite him to go down to the mining site and investigate that site because it is not very safe .

qikitarjuaq clam harvesting
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i would like to make a return to a question asked by mr. iqaqrialu on february 23 , 2000 .
mr. speaker , it was brought to the divers attention that in order to engage in commercial occupational operations , individuals must have a valid commercial occupational diving certificate from a recognised training facility .
certification obtained through a sport or recreational diving program is not considered a valid certification for commercial occupational diving .
unfortunately , these four divers held recreational diving certificates .
mr. speaker , the safety officer stated that if the divers were diving for compensation they needed a commercial occupational diving certification with the canadian standards association .
the divers agreed and asked for a letter stating this .
the safety officer completed an inspection report containing an order to cease operations and to obtain certification .
this will enable them to resume their commercial clam diving operation .

federal airport capital assistance program .
hon. jack anawak :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i have a reply to a question asked by the honourable member from baker lake on february 23rd , 2000 .
during preliminary discussions with transport canada staff in january , both the department and transport canada identified projects that could be supported with funding through the federal airport capital assistance program .
the department uses federal selection criteria to assess projects with high potential for acap funding approval before initiating a request for proposals for design .
applications for these projects must contain the detail engineering design referred to in the request for proposals since the proposal forms the basis of the acap application .
given the regulatory and safety requirements , funding for this design work has been identified in fiscal year 1999 / 2000 and will be recoverable from transport canada on approval of acap application .

support for smaller communities
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i have a reply to a question that was asked by the member for uqqumiut .
the question is in regards to support for smaller communities .
mr. speaker , i would like to provide a response to a question posed to the premier on february 21 , 2000 .
the question is regarding the nunavut government &apos;s plan to provide for the smaller communities who are not receiving decentralised government services .
in his remark the premier noted that the department had been working with smaller communities in developing community plans .
i would like to provide the member with further information on these initiatives .
other smaller communities such as whale cove , arctic bay and sanikiluaq have recently begun these community-planning initiatives .
the aim of these community-planning exercises is to encourage leaders to begin the process of setting realistic economic goals and place a plan to achieve them .
these programs are frequently used by communities to match funding from other programs such as those that are now being offered in nunavut by the government of canada .

return to oq 50 - 1 ( 3 ) : contracting information
hon. paul okalik :
thank you , mr. speaker .
as the information requested is compiled in almost ten pages of documentation , i will not read them into the record at this point .
instead , i will provide you with some of the background information and table the compiled information at the appropriate time on the order paper .
the information is broken down into nine contributing departments .
some finance staff were and are very new to their jobs .
our computer systems do not account for consultant contracts separately from other contracts or other financial information .
some divisions and functions have moved from one department to another during the period requested .
some departments have moved locations several times since april 1st resulting in disruptions in their physical records .
in determining which contracts should be included in this response , departments were asked to use the definition of consultant as set out in the oxford english dictionary .
consistent with the department of justice , they do not include contracts for lawyers who were felt to be distinct from the information requested .
the values associated with each contract are either values to date on existing contracts or maximum values .
they may include travel , sub-contractors , fees , translations and other disbursements .
the value given is therefore often well in excess of the funds actually received by the consultant for the services personally provided .
when looking at this review of consulting contracts , there are a larger number of contracts than this government would like to see .
some of the root causes of this include , there are many vacancies within the public service and many of the consulting contracts are used to fill these vacancies .
the vacancies caused urgent need and short time frames do not always allow time to publicly tender a contract .
the lack of knowledge and experience among the gn public service with contracting procedures are due partly to the fact that the public service is relatively new .
the costs of advertising are very significant .
for example on a simple ad , the advertising costs are around 2 thousand dollars .
members will have the opportunity to review the data for themselves .
but having said first that the level of sole sourcing exceeds those that my cabinet colleagues and i feel are desirable in the future .
of the 104 contracts , 20 % are valued under 5 thousand , and 60 % have values up to $ 25 thousand .
current contracting procedures permit sole sourcing on a number of bases , including allowing dms to sole source consulting contracts up to $ 25 thousand if the advertising costs would be excessive .
that provision appears to have been used in a number of instances .
of the contracts over $ 25 thousand , 65 % were obtained through a public process while among the 10 most expensive contracts , 90 % were subject to a competitive process .
it is hard to compare this information to other practices in other governments , as that information is not available in the same form .
part of the question for us should be not how it compares to other governments but how it compares to the process we want and require as a government .
beginning april 01 , 2000 , a number of measures have been approved to respond to this concern including ;
public works will create a process to provide quick access to common advertising by the nunavut government of upcoming consulting contracts in both inuktitut and english .
this will provide easy access for consultants to obtain details of such contracts .
two , public works will make lists of pending contracts available to all communities in nunavut , and provide information and connect interested parties with departments seeking contract services .
relevant ministers will report quarterly to the legislative assembly and publicly report on the government &apos;s progress beginning on april 1 , 2000 .

item 6 :
oral questions
question 237 - 1 ( 3 ) :
changes to elders funding policy
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is directed to the minster of culture , language , elders &amp; youth .
the nunavut government was established so we could make our laws reflect nunavummiut .
our elders are dying at a rapid pace and still they have to apply for funding rather than allocating funds to the community for elders &apos; programs .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister of culture , language , elders &amp; youth , mr. havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
in regards to the allocation of funding for elders , we are following the normal policy for applying for grants .
we have a policy in regards to the applications .
the one we are using is the gnwt &apos;s policy through the oic and we are using these policies right now .
we are going to leave those and get new policies that we are going to set up that will be available april 1 .
we are working on making a policy right now .
we are going to be listening to you and everyone that wishes to contribute information to the policy .
thank you .

mr. speaker , i thought i had replied to the member .
i replied to it on friday , there is no position paper or option paper gone to cabinet .
i can &apos;t comment on what some senior government official says in a newspaper even if you table it in the house .
no proposal has gone to cabinet concerning the apex treatment centre .
what has happened mr. speaker , is that , as a government , and has a department of health and social services , we are reviewing the options for the apex treatment centre .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :

speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of health , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i just wanted to correct what the member just said , it has gone outside my department .
as i said , it was done with consultation with the department of justice , so it did go outside my department with the department of justice .

oral questions .
mr. alakannuark .
question 239 - 1 ( 3 ) :
status of inuit qaujimajatuqangit
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question is for the minister of department of health and social services .
mr. speaker , much has been said by the minister and others about the importance of inuit qaujimajatuqangit , and the involvement of elders in the work of the government of nunavut .
members continue to ask for it to happen , but we don &apos;t see much evidence .
the minister has said as much .
one of the reasons we wanted nunavut is because we wanted to try more things the inuit way .
this is a great opportunity for us to try to do things differently .
mr. speaker , can the minister advise us how his department is going to develop culturally based programs involving the elders and the counselling people with some of these difficulties in their lives .
are you going to be involving the elders more .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
minister responsible for department of health and social services , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , first i would like to thank the member for his question , it is an excellent question .
some of the exciting things that we are doing , including here in rankin inlet , using a birthing centre incorporating inuit qaujimajatuqangit and that type of thing is going forward .
thank you , mr. speaker .

oral questions .
mr. puqiqnak .
question 240 - 1 ( 3 ) :
inuktitut writing systems
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question is directed to the minister of culture , language , elders &amp; youth .
mr. speaker , we as nattilik residents have our regional office in cambridge bay and kugluktuk .
we have an inuktitut writing system but everything is not written in inuktitut .
for example , when you are a minister of culture , language , elders &amp; youth , your ministers &apos; statements are always in english and they should be translated into inuktitut .
since this is your department &apos;s responsibility , most of the documents are not translated into inuktitut while it &apos;s your position .
do you have inuktitut translators , mr. speaker .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
point of privilege , mr. havioyak .
point of privilege
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
all the material is usually translated into inuktitut and inuinnaqtuun and before they are given out they are usually written translated .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
i think the member is talking about the documents that are being sent to the hamlet councils , perhaps if you would like to clarify mr. deputy speaker , mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , although we come from the same region , our dialects are different .
i apologize if i did not make you understand .
what i am trying to say is that we have regional offices in cambridge bay and kugluktuk .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
minster for culture , language , elders &amp; youth , mr. havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
in kugluktuk and in cambridge and also in kitikmeot region some time , i know that documents are supposed to be translated .
all the documents are supposed to be translated into inuktitut and inuinnaqtun .
i need to hear this kind of thing from all of you , so i could know .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. havioyak .
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
on april 1st when the nunavut government was established we celebrated the first of april for establishing nunavut government .
we are the aboriginal peoples of our region , of our land and our own writing system .
we should be using our own writing system , especially in kitikmeot .
the inuktitut language is not used as much as the english language .
we see a poster there , they welcome us to rankin inlet , and it is only in english .
the department should encourage and preserve and enhance the inuktitut language and automatically if you are going post notices to include inuktitut syllabics .
so , i am asking you , i am encouraging you to use that .
thank you , mr. speaker .
it is only a comment .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
i did not hear a question .
i want to remind the members of the legislative assembly that you should make your preamble brief because your preamble utilizes the question period .
so , make your preamble short during the question period .
thank you .

thank you , mr. speaker .
in regards to my colleague &apos;s comments and the member &apos;s statement .
i understood from him , that the access home bills vary from each other and sometimes they cannot really afford to pay for the bills .
i know that this is a concern .
in regards to his question , we could look into reviewing this for the private homeowners that cannot afford to pay for the bills , for their access housing .

it will be a bilateral process , with us the gn side doing our own consultations and nti doing their own consultations .
it &apos;s a process we hope to complete as quickly as possible and so we will waste no time seeking input from you and any other interested party at every opportunity we can .
if that does not answer your question i &apos;d be more than happy to answer further questions .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :

i will allow that same question .
minster of culture , language , elders &amp; youth , mr. havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i think i &apos;m finally understanding your question .
as i was saying , we and nti will be meeting to pool together our resources and every time that we do , you will be given the information that is brought forward .

my question is when will the information be made available .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
minister responsible for culture , language , elders &amp; youth , mr. havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :

they are having problems paying for their house rents , they &apos;re having problems paying for this and that .
my question to the minister is , will he consider looking at the cost of living in nunavut and increasing social assistance for the social assistance recipients .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
mr. speaker , of course i would , but those income support recipients are not the only ones having hardship .
yes , i will look at all those requirements , not just for the income support but for everyone else who depends on government programs .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
oral questions .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na uqaqti .

during a meeting last fall in iqaluit on iq , delegates called for co-operation with nti or that gn determine the plans for iq and form a task force to work on iq issues .
we approached nti on how best to organize this task force and who should be on it , should it be from the government or from the inuit .
how are we going to set up the inuit qaujimajatuqangit and what kind of task force we would need to work on the inuit qaujimajatuqangit .
before this task force is selected , we will be informed as to who will be on the task force .
are they going to be selected from the government or from the public .
we are aware that nti will also select the people that they want to see on the task force .
this is how it is now .
i believe i answered the question .

thank you , mr. speaker .

insurance for social assistance recipients
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i might make my question long , but i will try to keep it as brief as possible .
this question is for the minister of social services .
my question is going to be coming from the understanding that i got from my community .
we have , instead of getting monthly social assistance , they are put to work .
my concern is that it might become a safety issue .
if one of these social recipients should get hurt , can you tell us what the status is today .
thank you , mr. speaker .

is there a possibility of reviewing the whole process so that you could make it easier for the social recipients .
thank you , mr. speaker .

mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
could the member rephrase his question and be specific .
could you clarify your question please , mr. member .

mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
thank you mr. minister arvaluk .
people who are out in the workforce get paid every two weeks .
the people who are on social assistance are paid once per month .
to make it easier on these people is it possible for them to get bi-weekly cheques .
thank you .
speaker :
mr. arvaluk .
mr. arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
it depends on the individual &apos;s circumstances .
some of the social recipients get weekly cheques if they are not managing their money properly .
thank you .

there are some recipients who owe money to the department of social services , i don &apos;t know how , they have no idea why they owe money to social services .
and they &apos;re paying for their debts .
could you give an explanation mr. minister .

mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
well in my community we are not informed why we have to pay back the monies to social services .
it doesn &apos;t seem like anybody knows why we &apos;re paying money back , or maybe it was an error on the department &apos;s part .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
i don &apos;t hear a question .
unless the minister of education would like to respond .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i didn &apos;t hear a question , but i seem to be getting the feeling that the member is giving us direction to look into the matter .
i could look into it , possibly it would even be better that as he is a member of the legislative assembly , he could have investigated the matter and let me know .
i &apos;ll get them to look into it and i &apos;ll write him a letter , and let him know why they &apos;re paying the money back .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
we &apos;ll take a brief twenty-minute break .

mr. tootoo .
item 9 :
replies to opening address
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my reply to the opening address is a little lengthy , and i apologize for that up front .
but as regular members we don &apos;t have , we have to take advantage of every opportunity we can to express our concerns and issues for the record .
when i ran for office , i committed to work hard to hold the government accountable and to pursue the key issues of housing , education and healthcare .
the commitment i made to demand more openness and accountability in government has meant that i have asked a lot of questions .
this may not have pleased everybody .
but i am getting a good response from constituents .
this is the first time that iqaluit has been represented by more than one mla .
my two colleagues from iqaluit and the legislative assembly have demanding cabinet portfolios .
i am pleased that i have been receiving lots of advice and requests for information and support from my constituents .
i don &apos;t dwell on whether people live in the geographical boundaries of my constituency or not , i am open to anyone in iqaluit .
i believe that in my fast growing community , we must all work together .
i value the times that i have been able to collaborate with mr. picco and mr. okalik on issues concerning our constituency .
this past year has been hectic .
committee work has been demanding .
i have also had the privilege of travelling around the north .
everywhere i go i hear the same priorities and concerns .
one of the concerns i hear everywhere is our government &apos;s ability to do the job .
the throne speech describes the transition to nunavut as astoundingly smooth and says that credit must be given for the hard work required to make this happen .
i absolutely agree that our public servants have worked very hard to ensure that core programs and services are being delivered .
but at every turn i hear that we as a government lack the capacity .
while i agree that not having a fully staffed government presents tremendous challenges , we cannot allow ourselves to rely on this as an excuse .
in housing mr. speaker , i look at housing as an area of top priority for our government .
right now the baffin district office of the housing corporation is at roughly half of its regular capacity and that has been the case for some time .
it seems that many very important housing programs have been reduced and starved .
routine maintenance budgets are down and the money to undertake major preventative maintenance for our ageing housing stock is no longer there .
when i look at the journey taken by many of these employees through the transition to nunavut , i can see why we have lost capacity and good staff .
first there was the well-intended move to achieve greater efficiency by integrating housing with the department of community government &amp; transportation .
a lot of key people and positions were lost in this transition .
then in another well-intentioned effort to refocus resources , certain responsibilities were shifted to public works , telecommunications &amp; technical services .
i think it would be fair to say that the results were chaotic .
housing programs are simply not functioning .
we examined these problems openly , candidly and in detail in the committee of the whole for several days last year .
i expressed my view that there was historically a good reason for establishing a separate housing capacity in government in the early 1970 &apos;s .
at the time housing programs were fragmented and dysfunctional .
when buried in a larger department , housing tends to take a back seat .
now there are indications of a stand alone nunavut housing corporation that will be created .
a new president has been hired .
i believe that with the priority we have all placed on housing in our government , public housing , homeownership programs and technical support services for the communities should all be under one roof .
i would like to commend the regular members of this assembly for not losing sight of the priority of housing .
i am happy that the standing committee called a special meeting last fall and agreed that it was critical that the new housing units should be built using this year &apos;s anticipated surplus .
one of the consequences of the priorities placed by regular members on housing was the creation of the minister &apos;s task force on housing .
i am pleased to be a member of that task force .
the task force has worked hard to submit its interim report before christmas .
the report made one basic recommendation that time is short , build 100 public housing units this coming summer .
the task force made recommendations on the size of units , two bedroom units , based on what we knew of community needs .
we also recommended allocations based on the needs information that was available .
i believe the clear theme of the interim report of the task force was urgency .
i say let &apos;s get on with it .
i quite frankly i can &apos;t understand why the government is not coming forward with plans to build these houses now using our budget surplus if necessary .
i expected something would show up in the supplementary estimates that were recently approved .
why do we have to wait for the budget session .
we have all agreed that housing is a key priority .
it &apos;s in the bathurst mandate .
the nwt housing corporation had a two year budget cycle for planning and building new social housing and homeownership units , which worked well in nunavut with the sealift schedule .
now we have a very short window of time to get things happening before sealift .
planning , tendering , site preparation and selection and construction .
i am getting very worried that we are running out of time .
if we do run out of time before the new building season , then let &apos;s at least do something .
let &apos;s provide our communities more support for housing through our local housing authorities and associations .
we know they are seriously underfunded .
there are other areas of housing which need attention .
for example , we need a comprehensive housing community needs assessment .
the last survey was done in 1996 and there have been questions asked about whether it was done properly .
i am sure that if an idea like this were to come forward in a supplementary estimate it would be welcomed and i think the time for talk is over .
let &apos;s do something .
the importance of education , mr. speaker .
education is a huge department .
education is a key to achieving life long opportunities .
i believe the earlier we teach our children the better .
what it means for our society is that many of the problems that we are facing can be avoided if we provide critical learning and life skills to our children in their early years .
i believe these are fundamental questions we must address in nunavut .
how can we enhance our early childhood education programs .
how can we better support and enhance child care programs as quality programs that will assist in the development of our young children .
i know the minister of education has been occupied on the issue of internal restructuring , which has resulted from the dissolution of the divisional boards of education .
as i said in the budget session last year , i don &apos;t believe that many of our constituents are overly concerned with this organizational issue .
what they want to know is how the education system will improve and become more efficient and effective in nunavut .
they want to know how soon one of the bathurst inlet mandate goals , namely improving the student teacher ratios , will be achieved .
they want to know when we will have a trade school in nunavut so our apprentices won &apos;t have to go so far away for training .
they need to know that funding arrangements for the schools will be changed so that these types of trades programs will be provide on an ongoing , predictable basis .
i know that the minister has developed short term amendments to the education act and is working in consultation with many stakeholders on fundamental changes to the education act for nunavut .
however , with all respect to lawyers and policy makers , mr. speaker , amending the education act does not mean that things will get better .
it takes more than amending the act to ensure that inuktitut become integrated into the classroom and the curriculum .
it will take more than changing the law to deal effectively with the issues that are everyone &apos;s concern , such as class sizes , improving academic success and reducing teacher turnover .
i think this is at the root of the concerns of the nunavut social development council , being left out of what they consider a process of meaningful consultation on the new education act .
the nunavut social development council has a mandate under the land claim agreement , to participate in the design of new programs affecting people .
we need more than structural change and even amended legislation to make a difference .
let us look at reform of programs or creating new programs .
let us not be afraid to do things differently .
so much of our future depends on how we provide support and inspiration to our children in their formative years .
this is a critical issue .
as i said in my member &apos;s statement last week , looking at the pressures on every childcare centre in iqaluit , let &apos;s make sure these very important programs succeed .
let &apos;s take immediate steps to provide more support for early childhood education .
we need to begin training northern residents to become childcare workers .
we need to overhaul and enhance our policies for grants and contributions for non-profit child care societies .
the good news is that our legislature and our government have signalled that education will be one of the two core priorities of our new government .
now we need to figure out how we can make a difference , now we have to figure out how we can make it better and this work is urgent .
i will not offer a detailed prescription for our ailing education system today , mr. speaker , however i would urge the minister to make changes happen .
i wish him to be bold and i wish him to be creative .
he must not be afraid to do things differently .
i am confident that the support will be there from our legislature if the minister can develop new and better programs aimed at improving our education system in nunavut .
my constituents tell me that is something that has to change .
improving health &amp; social services mr. speaker .
i am encouraged that we have made some progress in health &amp; social services .
the nunavut nursing program has started and new financial incentives are in place to attract and retain nurses .
our region has been waiting for this facility since before the health transfer in 1988 .
a new hospital should allow more procedures to happen closer to home in our region rather than sending people south on expensive medical travel .
we have to make sure this one is done right because it is going to have to last a long time .
we have to make sure we continue to make progress with the new hospital .
we spend 20 million dollars a year on medical travel .
we have to find ways to reduce this onerous expense .
mr. speaker , i believe that voluntary groups and non-profit societies are the key to operating successful and credible programs in health &amp; social services in our communities .
there is no way the services they offer would be done as effectively or efficiently by government departments , yet many dedicated community groups seem to be in a perpetual state of financial anxiety .
our homeless shelter in iqaluit is feeling extreme pressures with the surge of population growth in iqaluit .
they seem to be suffering from one financial crisis after another .
fortunately , organizations like the qikiqtaaluk corporation and nti are expressing their concern and their social conscience .
they are backing up their concerns with dollars and other forms of real support .
i think we should welcome these partnerships with inuit organizations .
the baffin larga facility in ottawa was a major commitment of qc and nunasi in providing greatly improved services for baffin residents who must travel to ottawa for medical care .
i am pleased to see that we are finally making progress in getting baffin residents access to this excellent facility which i had the opportunity to visit last year .
we must see alcohol , drug and substance abuse as symptoms of the need for healing and wellness .
they cannot be treated in isolation , they must be dealt with in the context of the whole person .
we know what does not work .
we understand why it was necessary to close the only alcohol and drug treatment centre in nunavut .
now we have to design programs which work for the immediate needs of our people .
the need to do things differently .
mr. speaker , a word about my home community of iqaluit .
our community is dealing with the pressures of rapid growth and change .
we are also doing our best to meet our responsibilities as the capital of nunavut .
i see our town council is dealing with this crushing burden .
it seems like a number of serious issues are facing our community all at once .
i think that in the run up to division the gnwt put off dealing with a number of crucial issues in our community .
the sewage , water , land development should have all been in hand .
now council is working very hard to deal with these tough issues like the utilidor hook up costs in the lower base which are effecting some of my constituents .
these issues , like those in other communities are arising at a time when we don &apos;t seem to have as much public money as we had in the past .
the cost of living is rising at every turn .
we can &apos;t cut services further without real risks to people .
there are no immediate prospects for new revenue from ottawa .
our developing economy can &apos;t afford tax increases .
i think the only thing we can do is ask some hard questions about the way that we do business as a government .
are government departments as efficient as they might be .
can the service departments of our government be organized differently .
can we find ways to do things differently so as to be more effective and efficient .
can we manage our human resources in a way which promotes more productivity and improved morale .
can we make better use of our abundant natural resources to create employment and wealth in our communities .
can we identify fundamental values of inuit and apply those values to make our new government different .
can our government change so that it can adapt and survive in a harsh physical climate , the way inuit adapted and survived for thousands of years in an unforgiving arctic environment .
the bathurst inlet mandate sets out important goals and objectives , its fundamental task is to put people first in examining whether there are ways of doing things differently .
i urge our cabinet to be creative and innovative .
question the old approaches .
question the old models .
question the old way of doing things .
i know that the standing committees of this legislative assembly are resources cabinet can rely on .
provided you approach us in a spirit of partnership , open communication and mutual respect .
if we are to put flesh to the bones of the bathurst inlet mandate , we have to first ensure that we are as efficient and effective as we can be .
this can only be done by re-examining and if necessary , challenging every assumption that has gone into the design and operation of our new government .
now as we approach the end of the first year of our new government , it is time to ask these tough questions , which i think need to be asked .
in closing mr. speaker , i wish to say in reply to the throne speech , that the bathurst inlet mandate contains many noble goals and commitments .
since the vision we have had time to settle in , time to get on our feet as a new government .
now we have to take the bathurst inlet mandate and make it real .
the time for talk is over , we need action , now we have to get to work . thank you , mr. speaker .

chairperson ( mr. puqiqnak ) ( interpretation ) :
good afternoon all of you who are getting homesick and thinking of home .
we are going to be going into committee of the whole .
we discussed minister &apos;s statements , 50-1 ( 3 ) .
fuel price increases .
did you want to go ahead with the discussion .
i didn &apos;t hear you .
did you want to go ahead with the fuel price increase debate .
comments to the discussion at hand .
any comments .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , maybe in this discussion we would ask if the minister responsible for petroleum products would like to take the witness table with her staff for further questions .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) :
you are a little bit ahead mr. tootoo .
madame minister and her officials can go up to the witness table at this time .
welcome to the committee of the whole .
we would like you to introduce your officials .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
the person beside me is roy green with finance , or who deals with finance and is very knowledgeable about fuel issues .
chairman ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. thompson .
any questions .
comments .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , if we could kind of pick up where we left off on friday , we were talking about the revolving fund , or the price stabilisation fund of 5 million dollars .
i guess that is just the result of the differences , result in the increase in the fuel prices .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. green will be responding to the questions
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you . mr. green .
mr. green :
thank you mr. chairman .
the stabilisation fund opening balance was 2.2 with a forecast for 11 months . for the year-to-date we &apos;re still living within the 5 million dollar limit .
at this point in time it looks like the balance should be around 4.5 at the end of this current fiscal year .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. green .
mr. green :
thank you mr. chairman .
so , we are in the process now of accumulating this data so once we pull this report together we will be looking at what options are available to us .
one may be looking for some surplus revenue being placed back in the stabilisation fund .
another option may be to look at the limit for the short term and i can &apos;t say at this point in time if there would be any further recommendations for retail price increases .
but that would be part of the report that we will be submitting to the financial management board regarding fuel prices .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. green .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i would like to thank mr. green for his answer .
either , one , we pay down the stabilisation fund to allow some more flexibility or else we increase it .
in those options , what would be the process that things would have to go through in order for that to happen .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i am just wondering if that would be the process that would have to be followed on that , that it would come here for our approval .
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. green .
mr. green :
thank you mr. chairman .
but basically that &apos;s the process that we are using now .
the commissions that we pay for the fuel delivery contracts don &apos;t expire until august 31st , 2001 .
so basically we have no control over those cost components .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
the members are aware , but i would just like to clarify that we are dealing with 51 - 1 ( 3 ) , fuel price increases , minister &apos;s statement .
just so that we could proceed smoothly .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
the work that we are doing , we will be consulting with the public as we go along .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
i just have a few questions , chairman , for the minister and her staff .
in reference to the subsidy that is looked after by the minister &apos;s department , it is in excess of 9 million dollars for the petroleum products division .
under commercial it indicates that there is 1.61 million dollars in subsidy under commercial .
that breaks down into jet a-1 at 425 thousand , and also av gas at 162 thousand .
can the minister and her staff explain this type of subsidy as to actually who it is going to and stuff .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. green .
mr. green :
thank you mr. chairman .
i guess i should probably try to explain this 9.6 million dollar subsidy that has been talked about for the past week .
basically what that 9.6 million dollars includes is the total costs of delivering the service to nunavut .
what i should clarify here is that petroleum products acts through the petroleum products revolving fund act that was established in 1972 .
that fund is used to finance the inventory and the accounts receivable and this is where the o &amp; m expenses are paid .
so it is applied through this particular fund .
ppd &apos;s mandate is to recover all of it &apos;s operating costs , not the full costs , not all the costs are passed through the revolving fund .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. green .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
that was quite a long dissertation and explanation of what i was looking for , and i &apos;m still not sure whether you answered my question or not .
going back to the my question , in reference to talking about commercial , and i see another category in the same column under federal government , 196 thousand 6 hundred and 91 .
can you explain why there would be a subsidy listed under the federal government .
mr. green :
once again the subsidy ....
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. green .
could you please wait until you are recognized by the chairperson , i don &apos;t want you to forget that .
thank you , mr. green you can go ahead .
mr. green :
thank you mr. chairman .
sorry .
all i can tell you in terms of ppd &apos;s mandate , our mandate is to recover the operating costs from the retail prices .
so i am not sure if i have given you the information that you are looking for .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. green .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
i will go as far as to say that i think you did .
i think you answered my question .
is that what you said .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. green .
mr. green :
thank you mr. chairman .
that is correct .
mr. o &apos;brien :
what is the ...
chairperson :
mr. o &apos;brien i have to recognize you before you speak .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
minister what is the intention of your department in reference to these contracts coming to an end .
how , maybe you could elaborate on exactly what this means by the tendering process and all contracts , in reference to the delivery ending in 2001 .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. green .
mr. green :
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. green .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
there is somebody with their hand up , mr. arvaluk , point of privilege .
hon. james arvaluk :
i think we should get a briefing first in the caucus before we use up the public time in those questions , i don &apos;t know , that &apos;s my point of privilege .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
as i have stated earlier on , we are dealing with 51 - 1 ( 3 ) , fuel price increases and that &apos;s what we are dealing with .
so i think each and every person has a copy of that .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
i am not going to respond in detail on the minister &apos;s point of privilege or order , or whichever it was but i take exception to it .
this is why we are here .
so this is where i am coming from and i guess that was my next question .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
when the fuel prices went up our staff was given direction to review the prices in regards to mr. tootoo &apos;s question in regards to looking at the recommendations .
my staff will be reviewing the recommendations and looking at how we can deal with it better .
the review will start and from that , we are just using a system from a previous government as the nunavut government .
so at this point in time we will review it because we are mandated to , we were directed to review that .
at this point in time i cannot respond to you right now , but in regards to the figures , mr. green can respond to the technical questions .
so i will refer the question to mr. green in regards to mr. o &apos;brien &apos;s question .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you madame minister .
if you would like to respond , mr. green .
mr. green :
thank you mr. chairman .
with the question that was raised whether the commissions that are paid for the fuel delivery contracts were put into the costs of the fuel , it is .
it is part of the price that we need to recover from the retail sales .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. green .
i have other names on my list .
please wait patiently for your turn .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i would like to get further clarification on the stabilisation fund .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
if you &apos;d like to respond either the minister or mr. green .
hon. manitok thompson :
thank you mr. chairman .
this 5 million dollars is for a stabilisation fund .
we can &apos;t go over the 5 million dollars , it &apos;s a policy .
what did you say about the health hazard .
we don &apos;t understand his comments and you were talking about we don &apos;t understand how health is relevant to this topic .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. iqaqrialu could you clarify your question please .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i don &apos;t know if i can make myself clear but the health department has a 20 million dollar deficit .
i was wondering if we could get another 10 million dollar deficit .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i want to explain to you we don &apos;t have health issues here on the fuel price issue .
perhaps either one of you could make a comment .
i know that we &apos;re not dealing with health issues or health and social services at this point in time .
madame minister .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
the deficit of health boards is totally different from the stabilisation fund .
perhaps you should ask that question to the finance minister or the minister of health and social services .
you should be directing your question to either one of these ministers because we &apos;re dealing with fuel price increases .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you madame minister .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
now i understand that it &apos;s not going to have an impact on the deficit .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i didn &apos;t hear a question .
thank you .
mr. mclean . mr. mclean :
thank you mr. chairman .
and on that , a fuel price increase affects us all .
i have to go back and stand in front of hamlet councils and htos and my constituents justifying and i &apos;d like to have information so that i can pass it on to people .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re probably spending a lot more time on it than we have to .
but it really impacts the hunters and trappers and everyone in the community so i appreciate your answers .
so i &apos;m going to ask quite a few chairman and this is for my own information .
my colleague asked a question on the jet fuel and av gas . are we subsidising air fuel at the pumps in nunavut to the airline companies .
thank you .
chairperson :
thank you mr. mclean .
mr. green .
mr. green :
thank you mr. chairman .
in terms of the av gas , no , the actual value is 151 thousand .
chairperson :
thank you mr. green .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. chairman .
on the jet a1 and the 100 av , do we have to do this .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. green .
mr. green :
thank you mr. chairman .
in reference to your question , no we really shouldn &apos;t , don &apos;t really have to do this .
this is something we can look at .
that is one area that maybe we can take a look at .
probably look at increasing the price in the future to recover our operating costs .
chairperson :
thank you mr. green .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
do we subsidise the power corporation &apos;s fuel too .
thank you .
chairperson :
thank you mr. mclean .
mr. green .
mr. green :
thank you mr. chairman .
we &apos;re actually subsidising the inventory ferrying charge because it &apos;s in there .
thanks .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. green .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
okay , so you &apos;ve answered my question there .
wouldn &apos;t it be wise that the nunavut government and the power corporation bought fuel together .
because the volume would probably give them a better deal in buying it .
and how come we &apos;re letting the power corporation who is an arm of us go out and do a special deal when their volume is not as much as us .
does that make economic sense that we have the government buying two lots of fuel , when they could buy it all together at once .
is this correct .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. mclean .
mr. green .
mr. green :
thank you mr. chairman .
so , because of the power corporation &apos;s decision to re-supply six communities outside of petroleum products , we actually put up our transportation costs for those communities .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. green .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. chairman .
to me that just doesn &apos;t make sense as a businessman .
my next question is on the price of fuel here , i think it &apos;s $ 0.83 / litre at the pump .
i think you would probably have that here .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. mclean .
mr. green .
mr. green :
thank you mr. chairman .
i &apos;ll just run the costs so you can make note of those .
the total cost is around 90 cents to rankin and we &apos;re selling it for 83.25 cents .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. green .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
my last question and final question , how much of an increase do you think we &apos;re going to have this year by october that &apos;s going to be passed to consumers .
just a rough ballpark . will it be 5 cents , 6 cents a litre in october , november .
thank you .
chairperson :
thank you . mr. green .
mr. green :
thank you mr. chairman .
so to tell you at this point in time how much we can expect to pass along to the consumer , i wouldn &apos;t be able to tell you at this point .
all i know if we had to recover operating costs , the minimum we would require would be 10 cents .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. green .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. chairman .
so if i &apos;m correct here , we &apos;re looking at a minimum of 5-10 cents a litre price increase in the fall .
that &apos;s to sort of prepare my constituents and myself for the likelihood of that happening in the next six months .
thank you mr. chairman .
that &apos;s all i have for now .
chairperson :
thank you mr. mclean .
mr. o &apos;brien then mr. tootoo .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
i &apos;ll try and be brief in my questions .
i think you indicated minister , that there were six contracts outside of the normal tendering process for fuel .
one in particular is the power corporation .
what difference of fuel per litre .
chairperson :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. green .
mr. green :
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
thank you mr. green .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. chairman .
is there a possibility of doing that sooner so that we can get these savings in place .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
madame minister .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
we cannot break the contracts , we &apos;ll have to wait right to the end .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister , mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
i was referring more to the contracts that went out with the power corp .
with those six areas .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. green .
mr. green :
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. green . mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
i don &apos;t think i made myself clear , and that &apos;s my fault not the minister or staff .
that was the area i was referring to .
how long are we tied into those agreements in reference to , the decision was made prior to the nunavut government coming into affect .
it was made by the last assembly , the last cabinet minister or financial management board to allow the power corporation to deviate from the norm and buy their own fuel .
we accepted that arrangement , maybe not knowingly that it was going to increase , or maybe we did , in such a significant manner .
so that was the area that i was referring to .
so i guess my concern was how do we get around that .
and the sooner the better .
then i think it will go a long way to making our jobs a little easier so that the people in the communities understand why the cost is up .
so , i would like the minister to commit to that in order to simplify the documentation .
a one or two page document so the people in the community could see for themselves and they could go through and understand it .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien , madame minister .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , there are quite a lot of numbers that you have to deal with in regards to fuel prices .
we will work on getting easier to understand information out to the communities .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you madame minister .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , a few questions .
i just want to go back to one that i didn &apos;t understand earlier and just to make that point along with glenn .
i &apos;m just trying to wrap my head around all this information because i will have to explain it to my constituents .
i think as everyone is seeing it is not a very simple straightforward issue .
it is very complex and that is why we have all these questions .
we are just trying to understand it .
that is what i see this being about .
we do really need to understand this and i don &apos;t believe we are wasting public time in doing this .
just one quick question on the dnd and the federal government subsidy of what looks like just over 200 thousand dollars .
is that an actual subsidy or did you indicate that we would be recovering that from the federal government .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. green .
mr. green :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairperson .
but it is a cost to the government of nunavut to deliver this program unless our mandate is changed so we can start recovering the full cost of services for some consumer groups .
right now that mandate does not exist .
we have to change our mandate in order to collect the total cost to certain consumer groups like the federal government and the department of national defence .
but at this point in time the petroleum product &apos;s mandate is only to recover its operating costs .
not all the costs of delivering the programs .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. green .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
so now that i understand , we are subsidising the federal government for their fuel .
i think they should pay what it costs us for the full service of that delivery and i believe the same with the airlines .
they are passing on everything to the passenger .
you can look at the freight rates and how much the prices of tickets and cargo rates have gone up in the last two years .
but i really believe that we should pass those full costs on especially to the federal government .
you say it &apos;s not in your mandate .
what would have to happen in order for that to be included in your mandate so we do recover all those costs from the federal government .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. green .
mr. green :
the only concern i &apos;ve got with some of the other commercial groups .
for example for the airlines if we pass on a 5 cent increase to the airlines then they turn around and increase the prices by 7.2 .
that means it is still going to be a cost to the consumer and nunavut if we pass some of those costs to some of those commercial groups .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. green .
we are running out of time here it &apos;s almost six o &apos;clock .
mr. iqaqrialu i &apos;ll give you an opportunity .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman for giving me the opportunity .
i thought that mr. mclean had a very good question regarding whether or not there was going to be an increase in fuel prices this fall .
that &apos;s how i understood it , so i kept it as short as possible because it is almost six o &apos;clock .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
perhaps the minister or her official will answer .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , there was a question of whether there was going to be an increase in the near future .
we don &apos;t know but it is very likely and we are trying do a review and we will be putting together some recommendations for your review after .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you madame minister .
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i have a number of other questions , but recognising the clock maybe i will ask if we can move to report progress and continue with more questions tomorrow .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :

point of privilege
speaker :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
specifically the member &apos;s point of privilege concerned alleged inaccuracies in the cbc radio &apos;s morning news coverage of questions asked during the previous day &apos;s sitting .
the question of whether the media coverage accurately reflected the temperament of members on this issue is not one which the speaker can reasonably comment on .

minister &apos;s statement 71 - 1 ( 3 ) :
arctic winter games
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i would like to inform the house that team nunavut has been selected and is preparing to attend the
2000 arctic winter games in whitehorse between march 5th and 11th .
there are 1,700 participants that will represent nine contingents from the circumpolar regions at the games .
members of nunavut &apos;s first contingent to these games went through a number of qualifying rounds to make the team .
regional trials were attended by 900 athletes and coaches - that is about 300 per region .
of those , 535 qualified for the territorial trials .
the final composition of team nunavut is as follows : 199 athletes , 29 coaches , 12 mission staff , 6 cultural representatives , 3 chaperones .
that makes a total of 249 members for team nunavut in whitehorse .
mr. speaker , i believe that their hard work and dedication will serve as an inspiration to other nunavummiut who aspire to attend these games in the future .
their efforts to date should make us proud to see them representing our territory and competing in the colours of team nunavut for the very first time at these arctic winter games .
the government of nunavut is proud to support them in its efforts to fulfil the bathurst mandate initiative of promoting healthy communities .
mr. speaker , i ask members to join me in congratulating team nunavut 2000 and wishing them good luck .
go , nunavut , go .
thank you mr. speaker .

mr. kilabuk .
minister &apos;s statement 72 - 1 ( 3 ) :
climate change
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i would like to speak today to express a growing concern of nunavummiut .
i am referring to the topic of climate change and the effects it will have on nunavut and nunavummiut in the years ahead .
mr. speaker , when we hear people talk about climate change , they are referring to the build up of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere , and these gases interfere directly with our climate .
people who have studied climate change believe that human activities are upsetting a natural balance that has existed in our atmosphere for thousands of years .
the source of this problem lies with the world &apos;s heavy use of energy .
attached to my statement today are two charts that i saw for the first time when i attended the canadian council of environment ministers meeting in alberta in december .
environment canada scientists have developed projections on climate changes in canada over the next 80 years based on our energy consumption levels continuing at today &apos;s level .
mr. speaker , these tables show that in roughly half of the nunavut territory , the average winter temperatures over the next 80 years are projected to increase between 15 and 20 degrees .
scientists are also predicting that rain and snowfall will increase in nunavut as a result of climate change .
it is estimated that nunavut accounts for less than 1 % of the national greenhouse gas emissions for canada .
so we have a unique point of view on climate change .
we are one of the smallest contributors to the problem , but one of the biggest recipients of its impacts .
mr. speaker , i have asked my department officials to begin working with other agencies in nunavut on a greenhouse gas reduction strategy .
we will also be accessing the government of canada &apos;s climate change action fund to increase public awareness in nunavut on climate change .
finally , mr. speaker , in march i will be participating in a meeting of canada &apos;s energy and environment ministers .
this is the forum where canada &apos;s plans for addressing climate change are discussed .
in the days ahead , this house can expect me to report back on our progress on all three initiatives .
thank you mr. speaker .

mr. picco .
minister &apos;s statement 73 - 1 ( 3 ) :
expansion of the rankin inlet birthing centre
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , at the moment , the midwives and maternity workers in the rankin inlet birthing centre give care to all pregnant women in rankin inlet .
that is an average of 60 clients per year .
they are able to deliver about 30 babies per year to those women whose pregnancies are considered low risk .
when they complete their training , which should take about 3 to 5 years , these individuals will then be ready to become registered midwives , whose qualifications will be recognized across canada .
i want to take a moment to offer my encouragement and support to nowyah williams and diane tiktak as they pursue their dream of becoming registered midwives .
mr. speaker , throughout history , midwives have played an important part in the birthing process for women and their families in many cultures including inuit .
there is no doubt that doctors and hospitals offer important life saving equipment and skills necessary during crisis deliveries .
but mr. speaker , the services provided by midwives go far beyond the moment that the baby is born .
they begin their work early in a woman &apos;s pregnancy and they continue to provide care after the baby is born .
midwives work to promote and protect women &apos;s health while providing care , support and education to the women and their families .
mr. speaker , in only a few years the rankin inlet birthing centre has grown from a pilot project serving one community to become a midwife service for the kivalliq .
mr. speaker , this centre has been recognized nationally by other professionals as an excellent model of community based midwifery .
i commend everyone at the centre and the keewatin regional health &amp; social services board for their commitment to this program .
we will continue to observe the rankin midwifery program and expect this to be an excellent model for future projects across nunavut .

today i rise to thank the people of rankin inlet for their outstanding hospitality and especially shawn maley and sandy kusugak for their tireless hard work in organising this event .
the two weeks we have been here has made me realize that the nunavut government is definitely closer to the people .
the busy social schedule was great , even though i could not attend all the events .
it was great to hear the concerns of the elders , youth and hockey players .
my observations of my fellow colleagues , they seem to have enjoyed themselves and the kivalliq is a warm place , weather aside .
i want to thank the premier , cabinet , fellow mlas for agreeing to sit in rankin inlet .
i had an opportunity to see a lot of old friends .
mr. speaker , i hope the practice of moving the legislative assembly at least once a year to another community continues , so we can hear the concerns of the people of nunavut .
mr. speaker , i would like to say that a few announcements were made during this session that are very important to the citizens of nunavut .
manitok thompson , minister of housing , on the continuing efforts of the housing task force .
minister kilabuk on his efforts on community mobilization .
minister ng , on his surplus and his inuit employment plan .
the premier &apos;s statement on decentralization and training .
last but not least , minister picco &apos;s statement on our very own nunavut power corporation .
mr. speaker , these may not be ground breaking announcements but they affect all the citizens and the people of nunavut .

rankin inlet birthing centre
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
sometimes they would stay away from home for two months or more and would leave their family behind to go have their baby down there even though they were very healthy .
there are many people who have been born in manitoba from the keewatin region so therefore , i would like to thank the minister and keewatin people for supporting the kivalliq birthing centre .
we are very appreciative of getting the birthing centre .
i would also like to thank the stewards taking the midwifery training course .
in this way we can regain our traditional way of life .
i would like to thank the minister of health and social services and the staff at the nursing station and the midwifery centre and the elders for the training part of it .
thank you .

hamlet of clyde river financial status
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
before i go on to my statement , i would like to thank the residents of rankin inlet for their hospitality and their suggestions and their concerns that they have passed on to us .
mr. speaker , i rise today to draw the house &apos;s attention to this serious financial situation facing the hamlet of clyde river .
this morning i received a letter from the senior administrative officer at clyde river , concerning the hamlet &apos;s deficit position .
mr. speaker , i will be tabling this letter today and i would encourage the minister of community government and transportation to consider it seriously .
mr. speaker , we hear a lot about capacity problems in the territorial government .
but we cannot forget the capacity problems facing the hamlets .
these problems are not of their own making , and the residents of the smaller communities should not have to suffer simply because they want to live in their home communities .
thank you , mr. speaker .

during question period i was told to talk in the english language and i wasn &apos;t pleased with this .
i want to point out to you that from kugluktuk and in western kitikmeot , we speak inuinnaqtun , it is our language .
i want you to know that sometimes we have difficulty with our own language as yet , west kitikmeot .
but we are proud of this language and i want this western kitikmeot language of inuinnaqtun to be known .
in regards to the other item , last night they put up a talent show and i was proud of that and we saw lots of people who were drum dancing and singing .

mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker i rise today on this , the last day of the rankin inlet sitting of the legislative assembly .
mr. speaker , we began this sitting during a week of cold winds and grey clouds .
perhaps it is an omen that we conclude under the light of a clear afternoon and a blue sky that heralds the imminent return of spring .
i would like to thank the people of rankin inlet once again for their hospitality to us all and for their interest in our proceedings and for their community events that we all enjoyed .
this has been a memorable experience for us all .
mr. speaker , i would like to mention the elders group that spoke so eloquently at the hearing of the standing committee ajauqtiit on the review of the elections act .
once again , mr. speaker the comments we heard that day remind us all that the wisdom of the elders can guide us on these issues .
this was inuit qaujimajatuqangit in action .
mr. speaker , i would like to conclude by thanking you for presiding over a spirited sitting here in rankin inlet .
as an assembly we &apos;ve discussed and brought into the open a number of initiatives and issues .
it has been gratifying to see the public has been in frequent attendance .
we now look forward to reconvening in iqaluit in just three weeks time to begin the budget session which i am confident will be a lively one .
it has been a long time for many members of this house to go without the support of their loved ones .

location of nunavut power corporation headquarters
mr. mclean :
thank you , mr. speaker , this will be the last time i will rise in rankin inlet .
the minister responsible for our very own nunavut power corporation .
for the record can the minister advise the house today where the headquarters for the new nunavut power corporation will be located .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
minister responsible for the power corporation , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i believe that i will be hearing many more questions from mr. mclean over the coming months and years and i for one am looking forward to that .
mr. speaker , i can confirm the assumption that we are working under is baker lake will be the headquarters for the new nunavut power corporation .
indeed i believe the premier has written a letter to officially say that to the mayor of baker lake .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you , mr. picco .
oral questions .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
we will be dancing in the streets in baker lake tonight .
can the minister answer the next question .
what are the minister &apos;s best estimates for how many headquarters positions will be located in baker lake .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
minister responsible for the power corporation .
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker that is an excellent question .
to see what level of capacity that we will build over the next couple of years .
that will determine mr. speaker , how many jobs will be moved to baker lake .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you .
is the minister able to explain to me if the power corporation is going to have any type of training program now .
or will it be implementing one shortly , because my understanding is that the head office function will be set up by march 2001 .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
minister responsible for the power corporation .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker in the ikuma report we briefly touch on the training aspect for the nunavut power corporation .

they can include on the job training .

mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker , it &apos;s nice getting those types of answers , mr. speaker .
are there more subsidies that are like that , that we don &apos;t know about .
i would like to ask the minister if he would commit to doing a review of the subsidies that are out there and put a time frame to it .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister for finance , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , yes i can commit to doing a review to see exactly what subsidies that we have across all departments .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
oral questions .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker i appreciate that response from the minister of finance .
i would like to ask if he could commit to a time frame as to when we could possibly look at seeing this type of report .
i would think the budget session is coming up already in three weeks .
mr. speaker if i could get an idea of a time frame on that .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr tootoo .
minister of finance mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker it might be appropriate during the budget review of some department if they ask questions on what they would have .
i don &apos;t want to give too early a date , given that it takes a bit of work on behalf of all departments and the government as a whole .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
oral questions .
final supplementary mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr speaker , maybe i could ask the minister as we saw yesterday there are subsidies that are going to non-government agencies and companies .
also our subsidies in the report that we saw yesterday from the committee of the whole , it shows that we subsidise a number of our own government departments and corporations .
i &apos;m wondering if those too will be looked at .
if there is a better way of providing that subsidy .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister for finance , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , in trying to put together the information we would try to be as comprehensive as possible and try to cover all aspects of where the subsidies are going .
whether it is to a crown corporation or a non-governmental organization or other levels of governments .
we will try to be as comprehensive as we can in trying to put together that information .
thank you , mr. speaker .

mr. puqiqnak .
question 252 - 1 ( 3 ) :
level of eye care
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question is for the minister for health and social services .
mr. speaker , residents of taloyoak have recently expressed concern about the level of eye care that they are currently receiving .
at present eye doctors only come to the community for a few days at a time .
this is not enough time to allow for appointments of all those who need them .
people are going without the necessary care they need .
mr. speaker , my question is for the minister .
why do eye doctors spend so little time in communities like taloyoak .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
minister of health , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
from my understanding mr. speaker we signed off an agreement with the nihb , which are the non-insured health benefits on april of 1999 .
at that time we were only allowed to offer a fixed number of days of service based on the population .
a larger community like cambridge bay would get three visits a year .
so , i hope that helps to answer the question .
speaker : thank you mr. picco .
oral questions .
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker , and thank you for the quick response .
when we talk about three days , yes i know they could stay in our community for three days .
but what is the department doing to improve the level of eye care to the residents of smaller communities .
so that it can be better co-ordinated .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
minister for health and social services , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker , again a good question from the member .
right now the contract that we signed with the nihb tells us how many days we can serve a community and so on .
that is set by the federal government , and that is the uninsured health benefits .
that contract or agreement is up 2001 and we will be working to increase those days for our smaller communities , and indeed for all our communities in nunavut .
so we can have more days allowed for eye care and eye care exams .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco . oral questions .
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker , when can the residents of taloyoak expect to see an eye doctor .
i see you will be looking into it next year for the smaller communities .
i know the smaller communities will be looking to see the eye doctors stay in the communities for a longer time .
when can the residents of taloyoak expect to see an eye doctor in their community on a more regular basis .
thank you , mr. speaker .
hon. ed picco :
now i would expect speaker , that the eye team would have already been in taloyoak and i would believe another visit would be coming up .
i can confirm that with our kitikmeot board office in cambridge bay to see when the next visit for the eye team is expected .
again through the contract of nihb , the federal government that pays for these services tells us how many days we can get and it &apos;s based on the population .
so for a smaller community , like i said , it &apos;s for at least two visits a year of three days each .
we are going to try , when that agreement comes up , to bring that total up so that the smaller communities and even the larger communities can get more service under that contract .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
oral questions .
mr. iqaqrialu .
question 253 - 1 ( 3 ) :
climate change
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i would like to direct this question to the minister of sustainable development in regards to the climate change .
first of all , i would like to say that i grew up as a hunter and having to stay outside all the time .
i too can notice the change from the past to the present .
the weather did not just start changing .
it started warming up quite a long time ago and it kind of cooled down in the mid years as i was growing up .
in your statements you have stated that scientists have done research on the climate and i could tell you that the elders know the environment very well because they have lived it .
why have you not involved the elders in the climate change study .
that way you could use inuit qaujimajatuqangit to study how the weather pattern is from the past to date utilising the elders .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) : thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister of sustainable development , mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the scientists have done studies for quite a number of years .
they &apos;ve been keeping close watch on the climate and weather and they now understand that the weather is getting warmer .
i just tabled the federal government scientists &apos; reports so that was part of my minister &apos;s statement .
to date , we have not made any plans about whether we should use the elders on global warming .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kilabuk .
oral questions .
mr. nutarak .
question 254 - 1 ( 3 ) :
pension payments
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i was going to direct this question to the premier , but perhaps i should direct it to the deputy premier .
mr. speaker , the elders are not receiving their elders pension for quite a long time and today we have no other means to survive except by getting some money .
i know that these elders don &apos;t have jobs .
they receive their pensions too late .
i know that this is the federal government &apos;s responsibility and it &apos;s in their jurisdiction .
so therefore , i would like to ask the deputy premier if the nunavut government could take the responsibility over the old age pension cheques .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
deputy premier mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker the member is correct , it is a federal program and because of that they have responsibilities for the payments but that is a very specific problems on timing issues .
certainly it is an issue that we could raise on behalf of all our constituents so if it is a universal problem then we could try to deal with it .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :

question 255 - 1 ( 3 ) :
federal budget
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question is again for the minister responsible for finance and administration .
mr. speaker , i &apos;d heard that the minister of finance was interviewed on the radio regarding the federal budget address .
i would like to ask the minister if he would take the opportunity to formally advise the house as to any preliminary reaction from yesterday &apos;s budget .
thank you , mr. speaker .

there will be an analysis from our department of finance and administration on the federal budget &apos;s announcements yesterday .
right now i &apos;m in the process of having it translated and it &apos;s almost complete .
i was going to provide a copy of that to all the members of this house .
it summarises the initiatives in respect of tax reduction and some of the investment initiatives announced in the federal budget .

thank you mr. ng .
oral questions .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , does , i know i just asked the minister if he plans on responding to his colleagues at the federal level .
is that something that &apos;s normally done if they &apos;re happy with it or not .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister responsible for finance , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i think there will be a response coming forward this afternoon as a result of that premier &apos;s conference .
but historically , no , finance ministers themselves don &apos;t normally , without having a scheduled meeting with the federal finance minister , bring up these things in person .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
oral questions .
mr. mclean .
question 256 - 1 ( 3 ) :
hunters &apos; compensation budget
mr. mclean :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question today is to the minister of sustainable development .
can the minister confirm to me that the hunter &apos;s compensation budget for all of nunavut is 15 thousand dollars .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
minister of sustainable development , mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i can confirm here that the 15 thousand dollars is directed towards that .
you &apos;re correct .
speaker :
thank you mr. kilabuk .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
mr. speaker , 15 thousand dollars is not a lot to help out the hunters in nunavut if they have any kind of acts of god or any problems .
is the minister looking at reprioritising some funding in his department and increasing that funding because 15 thousand dollars in my opinion would only take care of one person in nunavut .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
minister of sustainable development , mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
it will be reviewed , we &apos;re reviewing it at the moment and at the next legislative assembly we will be discussing this once everything has been reviewed .
speaker :
thank you mr. kilabuk .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. speaker .
he answered my question .
so we can expect to see a new policy in place that will reflect the change in needs in nunavut .
that this policy will be put forward in the next sitting of the house .
i think that &apos;s correct .

return to wq 3 - 1 ( 3 ) :
gjoa haven water contamination
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker i have a return to a written question asked by the honourable member from gjoa haven .
the first five questions were asked by mr. puqiqnak and the rest are by the department of health and social services as additional information on this very serious issue .
mr. speaker ,
1 .
what is a blood worm ?
the larvae that are in the gjoa haven water supply are not what we would call a blood worm in english .
they are the larvae of the common midge fly .
2.what size are niviagait larvae ?
the larvae are approximately mr. speaker , a half inch long .
3 .
where do the niviagait larvae live ?
they live in lakes , ponds and water reservoirs throughout the world .
4 .
what do the niviagait larvae eat ?
the larvae feed on water plants and water animals .
5 .
how often do the niviagait reproduce ?
answer , they do not reproduce , mr. speaker , the larvae transform into niviagait and the niviagait mate and the female lays eggs in the water .
the eggs hatch into the water and the larvae can grow over winter in the bottom of lakes , ponds and water reservoirs .
6 .
are they resistant to chlorine ?
chlorine does kill the niviagait larvae .
we &apos;re not sure how long it takes to kill them .
it might depend on the temperature of the water .
the niviagait larvae are not harmful to human health .
7 .
what are they ?
they are flies similar to mosquitoes .
they are common everywhere .
they are found near lakes and ponds and water reservoirs and they can be observed in great swarms during the warmer ice free months .
they differ mr. speaker , from mosquitoes in that they do not bite .
8 .
what are the consequences to human health of having them in your domestic water supply ?
they don &apos;t pose any risk to human health .
9 .
why is this problem happening in gjoa haven ?
all water reservoirs in nunavut contain these larvae .
at least two communities have reported finding them in their domestic water supply in recent years .
this problem often arises when a community is outgrowing the water reservoir .
when the water is pumped out of the reservoir some bottom sediment is taken up at the same time .
since that is where the niviagait larvae live , they get taken up with the rest of the sediment .
10 .
what is the role of health and social services in this issue ?
it is the role of health protection personnel to identify the causes of such problems and determine the effect on human health .
the root cause of the problem lies within the mandate of another department of government .
it is passed out to that department &apos;s action .
interdepartmental action is necessary to identify potential problems and work together for the benefit of all the people in the communities .
it &apos;s beginning now to come to a conclusion .
i would also like to thank the mayor of gjoa haven .
i spoke with him last friday about this issue .
and again , mr. speaker , we are trying to do what we can .
mr. anawak &apos;s department has been working very hard .
the problem as i understand has almost been rectified , as i understand .
that screen is coming in .
thank you , mr. speaker .

item 9 :
replies to opening address
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i &apos;m pleased to reply to the commissioner &apos;s address .
this has been a very busy year for me getting to know what an mla is all about .
the first thing i learned is that being an mla means never having enough time at home .
right after being elected we started work .
in the past year , i &apos;ve only been home a few weeks before i had to get back on the road for committee work and travel .
i was given the privilege of being chair of the government operations committee .
i &apos;m also a member of the ajauqtiit committee and the management services board .
i wish to thank my colleagues for entrusting me as one of the co-chairs of full caucus and recently to be asked to be chair of regular caucus members .
i &apos;d also like to thank my constituents for being so understanding about why my work load means i don &apos;t have as much time to be in my constituency as i would like .
sometimes they are surprised to see me in town for more than a few days at a time .
mr. speaker , my family too are getting used to me being away although it is hard on my two little girls it is also hard for me to be away from them .
over 100 miles from cape dorset , this important asset of soapstone is important to people from both kimmirut and cape dorset .
sadly a young man was killed at the quarry last year .
i want the minister to see this important site and then work with us to help make it safe .
our constituents are also anxious to see the hon. manitok thompson and show her our housing needs so i would like to invite her too .
when i look at housing pressures in my home community of cape dorset , it is obvious that housing relief is needed right away .
( interpretation ends ) it is plain to see from the one bedroom list and one person required a three bedroom unit , there are at present no houses available in cape dorset .
no one who has a house is moving out .
this list will only grow .
the director of housing and public works , mr. bob workman , tells me that there are still quite a few applications to be processed .
there are also a lot of people who aren &apos;t even bothering to apply for housing since they know that no housing is available .
these are often young people who want to be on their own but are forced to remain with their relatives .
community learning centre .
education is also a top priority in my constituency .
i attended the annual general meeting of the district education authority of cape dorset recently .
one of the community &apos;s biggest concerns is that we have an urgent need for a community learning centre .
right now the community learning centre has been taking up space in the school and space for the high school is too small .
this course is needed if we are to have local people ready to take up those new jobs . the new community learning centre has been planned with full community involvement .
( interpretation ) the new building design includes a full arts and crafts studio .
cape dorset artists are famous around the world , our young people must learn the skills of the older artists who have put cape dorset on the map in the art world .
the west baffin co-op has been very involved in the planning of the new community learning centre and the co-op will help train local artists in this new arts and crafts studio .
( interpretation ends ) mr. speaker , our planned community learning centre is a story of frustration and delay . our community was expecting this important building to have been completed in 1999 .
the community learning centre was in the gnwt capital plan and was approved to go ahead . i have seen the project brief .
project briefs are prepared for projects which are about to commence . the project was even given a number and a code .
a project team was put together and here is the planning which was approved . 1997 - geo-technical survey , design and tender . 1998 - site preparation , 1999 - construction .
thorough community consultations took place on what should go on in the new centre , a good site was selected , an architect was hired and the design was begun .
it seems that no one was available to do that work in cape dorset that summer , although some work was done on the site .
a project officer was assigned to the building , funds were carried over for 1999 and then nothing happened .
mr. speaker , no one seems to know why this very important project for our community suddenly stalled in 1999 .
i am not blaming anyone , maybe it got lost somehow in the division process .
arctic college officials tell me that the learning centre in cape dorset is still a top priority for the baffin capital plan .
i am not so concerned about what went wrong , that is water under the bridge , i just want to work hard to get the project back on track .
so while we wait for this project to be brought back to life the adult students are without the advantage of internet access and upgraded computers .
the other reason to build the new centre is that the present clc is taking up space which is very much needed for the high school students in peter pitseolak school .
both our community schools are full , the junior high school , sam pudlat school , had 215 students last year and this year we have 251 . thirty six more students .
the high school , peter pitseolak , is also full . it has 240 students , 25 more than last year .
the anticipation for the year 2000 / 2001 is that this will get even higher if the decentralized positions are filled from other people from outside of cape dorset .
mr. speaker , when the new community learning centre is built it will free up class space which is very much needed in the high school to offer learning programs .
mr. speaker , i hope that i have convinced you all and especially the minister of education , that this community learning centre is really needed in cape dorset .
it &apos;s needed to train adults and it &apos;s needed to free up much needed space in peter pitseolak school .
mr. speaker , cape dorset water pipe line .
cape dorset also has another urgent need and that has to do with the water supply .
mr. puqiqnak knows that a safe and reliable water supply is very important in every community . we are not the only community who has a serious problem with our water supply .
our water comes from &quot; t &quot; lake which is about a mile away , and several hundred feet above our community .
water is delivered by pipeline and the problem is this line is over 20 years old with galvanised iron . mr. speaker , this problem has been known for some years .
the hamlet tells me the pipeline was due for replacement in 1998 / 99 in the gnwt capital plan . for some reason it never happened .
( interpretation ) now the problem with the pipeline is getting worse .
hamlet employees try to clean this rust out of the system by flushing the pipe at the bottom , recently five pounds of rust was taken out of the bottom of the pipe line .
one day there was eleven pounds of iron and sediment that had to be taken out of the bottom of the pipe .
also the pipeline itself is not in the best of shape . the hamlet cannot use spare connectors to repair the pipe anymore .
repairs are being made with duct tape .
the heat trace has to be turned off and that section of the pipe taken apart and taken to town for defrosting .
this costs a lot , and we are lucky there haven &apos;t been more serious freezing problems .
several times we had to use the water from dead dog lake , while frozen spots in the pipe were cleared .
that lake is shallow because the river was re-routed .
we have to pump very close to the bottom of the lake in winter to get the water .
the pump stirs sediments on the bottom making it undesirable and unsafe .
we need an external heat trace , and the heat trace also requires a lot of electricity , up to 200 thousand dollars per year .
our sao tells me that total maintenance costs were about 300 thousand per year .
we need a new pipeline laid out with a proper rate of slope .
mr. speaker , i would like to thank the minister for sending in senior public works and community government officials to look at this situation .
i am very hopeful that they have put in place a plan to fix this problem soon .
i also know that the minister of community government is well aware of these problems and this is something that i will be looking for with great interest in the coming budget session .
community breakwater in cape dorset .
another important project which seems to have been falling by the side of the road in cape dorset , is the community breakwater .
mr. speaker , our community has a marine economy .
our people depend on water not just for hunting and fishing but also for a source of soapstone .
we have a pretty big tide and on certain days with strong winds our boats cannot get proper shelter in our harbour .
last year a storm damaged a lot of boats and the peterhead boat owned by nuna parr dragged its &apos; anchor in the wind and was so damaged that it has not sailed since .
lake winnipeg boats turned over , motors and all were lost as well .
the solution mr. speaker , is a breakwater .
my constituents know exactly where the breakwater should be built since a lot of planning and discussion has gone on over the years .
mr. speaker , this breakwater will cost money but it will save our community &apos;s vessels from costly damage in our severe fall weather .
kimmirut arena .
mr. speaker , the story of the effort to get an arena is a long story of frustration and hard work .
since the gnwt announced a program to build arenas and encourage healthy lifestyle opportunities for youth in all communities including the smaller communities , our citizens have been waiting for their arena .
the people of kimmirut have been very pleased to see smaller communities such as whale cove and chesterfield inlet get arenas , we are happy for them .
i was pleased to see that even a smaller community of whale cove has a full sized arena .
kimmirut , whose population was 397 in 1996 census is still waiting .
i was going to say that the people of kimmirut are patiently waiting , but mr. speaker , their patience is running out .
the problem has been made worse in the confusion which has occurred in the division process .
our arena project was in the gnwt capital plan just before division .
in fact kimmirut arena has been in the gnwt capital plan since 1990 .
the next thing we knew everything was under review .
the mayor of kimmirut , mickey akavak , has been working very hard on this arena project .
previous mayors of kimmirut have worked on this project .
three previous mlas have worked on this project .
mayor akavak has shared some highlights from his extensive files on this project mr. speaker .
the files show that the arena was in the gnwt five year capital plan for 1987 .
at that time it was scheduled for completion in 1992 / 93 .
it was delayed again to be built over two years in 1995 / 96 and 96 / 97 .
mayor akavak was shown a project brief in may 1998 .
this was a signal to him that the project was finally going ahead .
the arena was also in the last five year capital plan for the gnwt .
it was to have been completed in 1999 .
the hamlet is still waiting .
the mayor &apos;s thick file also contains many letters written about this much sought after project in kimmirut .
one letter in particular expresses the view of constituents very well .
it was written by the mayor of broughton island , mayor lootie toomasie to mayor akavak and dated january 30 , 1998 .
i would like to quote from this letter because mayor toomasie clearly described the tremendous benefit that he felt having this facility in your community .
he said , &quot; over the past two years the arena here in broughton island has been a centrepiece of activity and social interaction .
at this point in time we have on average 150 to 250 people per night &quot; .
but a new sewage lagoon was on this list .
this is because the new sewage lagoon , classed as regulatory requirement , met the department &apos;s criteria for high priority capital items .
mayor akavak and his council feel that youth and recreation are even more important than a new sewage lagoon .
the mayor tells me that there seems to be growing vandalism in kimmirut which involves young children .
mayor akavak says that even some of the younger children seem to be frustrated having heard that the arena was coming in 1999 .
the kimmirut hamlet council has considered this carefully .
they are all so anxious to have their new arena that nothing else is more important .
the mayor has also pointed out that the hamlet council recently agreed to go with the soper lake arena location , because of complication in the hilltop location .
clean up of the site is required and the new location will be a lot less to develop .
having waited so long the council is hopeful that the arena will be built in one year when it is approved .
mr. speaker , i would like to recognize the efforts of the hamlet council in kimmirut to reduce their local government expenditures over the last couple of years .
our government should finally reward the residents of kimmirut with their long awaited arena by building it this coming fiscal year .
kimmirut housing pressures :
kimmirut is also facing serious housing pressures .
this is particularly acute with young people .
their population is growing fast but no public housing units are available .
as kolola pitsiulak , the manager for kimmirut housing association told me , this causes social problems like overcrowding and higher utility and maintenance costs .
the housing association did a rough survey last october .
this was not a comprehensive needs assessment but it gave me a picture of the pressure on the local authority .
right now there are ten approved applicants on the waiting list who need one or two bedroom units , and a further four applicants who are waiting for approval .
mr. speaker there are a large number of kimmirut residents who are eligible for housing but have not applied because they know there is no housing available .
the housing authority did a survey that identified a total of 24 needed one or two bedroom units .
there are also three who were identified as needing three or four bedroom units , but are not eligible mostly due to arrears .
the local housing authority recommends that if new units are to be built , the need of each community should be taken into account in deciding what should be built .
the kimmirut housing authority does not want to be told this is what you will get without consultation in kimmirut .
the association recommends that the housing corporation should consider multiplex one bedroom units .
kolola pitsiulak noted recently that the interest in home ownership seems to be declining .
this aggravates the housing shortage in kimmirut .
in decentralised communities where new housing is being built for the new government staff this often provides relief for the local housing authorities since public housing tenants sometimes move into the new housing .
however , small communities like kimmirut don &apos;t have that advantage .
the local housing association is also facing a continued pressure on its o &amp; m budgets .
as mr. pitsiulak put it in a recent letter to me , o &amp; m budget funding is shrinking while the expenses of doing business are rising .
the latest example is the increase in the price of fuel announced in january 1 , 2000 .
the shrinking o &amp; m budget has also meant that local housing authorities have been unable to give their hardworking employees pay increases in kimmirut .
the local housing authority employees are stuck at 1993 pay levels .
mr. speaker , in closing , i have outlined the strong priorities placed on education and housing for my constituency , in both communities .
as well kimmirut is wanting its new arena and cape dorset is in great need of a breakwater .
i look forward to working with the cabinet and my fellow mlas to achieve these goals for my constituency .
thank you , mr. speaker .

review of local fuel delivery contracting procedures ( withdrawn )
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
the motion that you just read , we don &apos;t have a copy .
it will have to be handed out to the motion .
does everyone have a copy of the motion .
if everyone does have a copy of the motion then that is okay .
but we need a copy of that motion at the head table .
thank you .
the motion is in order .
comments or questions to the motion .
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
it states in the motion here to undertake a review of contracting procedures for local fuel delivery . i think it is the government that sets the price of fuel .
the price of fuel is already set . i don &apos;t think the contractors set the price of fuel .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
can anybody who is knowledgeable about that respond to the motion .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i don &apos;t believe that is the case in every situation in nunavut .
in some cases there are independent suppliers that aren &apos;t regulated and they can raise the price up from what they purchase it from the government .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. anawak if you would like to make another comment .
hon. jack anawak :
this question is that i don &apos;t think that there are that many people out there .
the majority of people who deliver the fuel are contracted to the government .
i suspect the only ones are in iqaluit .
all the others the government would set the price of gas at the pump .
i would think this problem would be localised to iqaluit .
chairperson :
thank you mr. anawak .
maybe mr. green would you elaborate and make clarification on this .
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
what mr. anawak just mentioned is true .
the only place that is different is where local iqaluit people use that procedure .
but the contractors are not usually the people who will set the price on fuel delivery .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , minister for petroleum products .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
i would like to ask this question but i &apos;m not sure who i should ask this too , but the contractors in iqaluit are still under the ruling of the government .
as canadians , what is the fuel or oil price procedures and this is how i perceive the motion is meant to be read .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
there is a motion on the floor moved by mr. tootoo .
the minister and her officials have made a clarification .
are there any comments our questions .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairperson i would just like to clarify as to why we put the motion together like that .
in every community there is a set rate that the government sets for the fuel .
however , if you run out of fuel there are additional charges such as call out charges and etc .
i was looking at those types of things .
we want to make sure that the consumers best interests are looked after throughout this process . thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) : thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. arvaluk . hon. james arvaluk :
i am not disagreeing with the principle of the motion rather this motion would recommend to the government to interfere with the private enterprise pricing system .
that is the only question i have .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i don &apos;t believe that we are trying at all to say the government would at all interfere in private contracts .
i think we are just saying to take a review of the procedures and to ensure that all those factors are considered .
i &apos;m not talking about trying to interfere or anything like that .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. anawak
hon. jack anawak :
thank you mr. chairman .
basically , when the government contracts out fuel delivery services and gas delivery to all the communities , the contractors determine their hours .
i wouldn &apos;t want to interfere if some entrepreneur buys from the contractor to sell after hours , let say after hours of the other gas stations .
i wouldn &apos;t want to interfere as long as the price remains constant , as the government sets it to the contractors .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you , i think there is going to be a movement and i &apos;m detecting it in this region .
their will be a movement outside the pol contractors that will want to get into distributing gasoline and petroleum products .
if these individuals are successful at doing this then there is not going to be any regulation on what they can sell the price of gasoline or home heating fuel for .
we are the ones who come under fire for this .
and i know we are going to come under fire for this .
that is a problem i see coming .
i know there is no standard there , because i did the checking myself .
i don &apos;t know what the standard is in chesterfield inlet , but they are all different , to my recollection .
that is a direct hit to the consumer and we have heard that in the house what the price of home heating fuel and gasoline is .
i know that from first hand experience that this is happening in this region .
because i &apos;ve talked to bankers about it and it is a concern to them .
i think that is what this motion is getting to .
we &apos;re not trying dictate to the private sector , but what we are doing here is let &apos;s have uniformity across the board .
because , i know that if the minister and her department checked in this region , that the disparities are huge .
it is no secret that a lot of people in nunavut live paycheque to paycheque .
some people do not have six or seven hundred dollars to purchase fuel at the minimum requirements .
so i think that is what we are getting at here in protecting the consumer .
i don &apos;t think we want to quash the private sector .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. mclean .
minister anawak .
hon. jack anawak :
again , i would agree there needs to be some kind of a guideline to the contractors on call out charges after hours .
but on this particular motion , to me , it is fine it if you are able to interpret that motion to mean that .
but basically what this does is talk about the price i pay at the gas station .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i believe that the whole concept of this motion was that when the nunavut government awarded fuel contracts that it would consider the lowest possible bidder .
i think it is no secret if it costs us more to do something that cost will be passed on to the consumer .
so i guess that all we are trying to say here is simply that .
these things should be taken into consideration as key factors during the selection process .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister thompson .
hon. manitok thompson :
thank you mr. chairman .
when mr. tootoo mentioned the motion we understood what he was trying to get us to do .
we agree with what his motion was earlier .
maybe just the wording of the motion should be changed a bit to address what his concern is , because we can do that as a department .
we can review the fuel contractors call-out charges , and pricing procedures for private operators .
it is probably just the wording of the motion that is confusing people or the members .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
if there is to be an amendment to the motion you will need to do it officially through a proper motion .
more comments mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
have it re-worded so everyone is happy with it , and then deal with it when we reconvene in iqaluit .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
i will ask you now if you are withdrawing the motion .
mr. tootoo :
yes mr. chairperson .
i will withdraw that motion now .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
the motion is withdrawn .
committee motion 45 - 1 ( 3 ) :
affordable fuel prices
mr. tootoo :
mr. chairman then i have one more motion .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
the motion is in order .
to the motion .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you .
the only problem i have is that most of the prices whether it &apos;s fuel or consumer goods , all the prices that most of us cannot afford .
i am just wondering what is the aim of keeping fuel prices at a level most us can afford to pay .
what is it eighty cents , fifty cents .
i guess what will happen is that the fuel prices per barrel around the world will continue to increase for example , then we continue to subsidise fuel prices more and more .
something else has to give .
because the government will have to increase the limit of the five million dollar buffer zone in order to increase that price stabilisation fund ceiling .
then do we cancel the building of a school , or cancel something else in the government programs .
because it will require a few million dollars to keep that cap that is requested in this motion .
so i have these two questions mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
mr. tootoo .
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , again here the intent of this motion is to ensure that people can afford to buy gasoline to go hunting .
say we don &apos;t subsidise fuel anymore will it continue to go up and up .
will the people on income support , will the minister responsible for income support provide extra funding to those individuals to buy that fuel , as the cost of living is going up .
it is the same thing with the municipalities .
the money is all coming from the same place .
so if we are not going to subsidise it from one level the money is coming from somewhere else .
the way that the public of nunavut are being paid and the way the municipalities are funded is adequate .
if there isn &apos;t any control then it must come from somewhere .
those are the areas and people we need to protect so they can do that .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
i find this motion to have a very narrow vision .
because you cannot govern the budget process through the price stabilisation fund alone .
you cannot have the government basing their operations on the fuel prices .
you have to look at all your programs and set your priorities .
the problem i have here is that everything will be based on how the price of fuel rises and lowers around the world .
i am having a hard time when i &apos;m looking at the government performing the budget process under that motion .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman . chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman . i think i understand what the members are trying to move but there &apos;s some contradictions in the different motions .
and what someone doing minimum wage can afford will be different than what someone else can afford . so who decides that .
chairperson ( interpretation ) : those questions were already brought up and please keep to the motion at hand .
chairperson ( interpretation ) : thank you picco .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. picco , i will give you the opportunity to make a comment but i have another name on my list .
hon. ed picco :
i &apos;m not saying that at all .
and if you reduce the subsidy to a business , they &apos;re going to have to recover their costs somehow .
i &apos;m not here to debate , i &apos;m asking you a question and you can come back and clarify .
i &apos;m not here to argue with the member , and if the member wants to talk about elders and so on and so forth , i agree him and everyone agrees with that .
mr. chairman , this is the same debate all across canada , deciding what people can pay .
we &apos;ve seen the prices of fuel increase , we don &apos;t generate fuel here in nunavut , we have to buy it at the world market prices .
those costs are outside what we can control .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. picco .
i will give this person an opportunity to ask a question .
i think it will be easier . mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
if we should decrease the subsidy , then they will just pass on the increase to the customer .
i can use the example of an airline where if there &apos;s an increase in the fuel , then they will increase the price to the consumer .
we as a government , we &apos;re not in opposition , we are a consensus government .
we have feelings and we &apos;re not going to make a drastic increase in the rates .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
we &apos;re starting to talk about the same issues over again .
there is a motion on the floor .
it can go either way .
it could be carried or defeated .
because we &apos;re talking about the same issues , i would like to ask mr. tootoo to keep the process going and not ask the same questions .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , maybe to try and bring the debate to a close is if i can suggest an amendment to the motion .
it &apos;s a very small one .
again the intent of what we &apos;re trying to do here with our recommendations is to focus on where the need is .
mr. chairman , the amendment there is adding , trying to keep the fuel prices at levels that people can afford to pay .
i believe some of the concern from the other side of the floor is that it would force the government to keep prices at a certain level .
i think this would help to alleviate those fears .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
before i give the two other people an opportunity i would like to give these two an opportunity .
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
people who are making the comments , they &apos;re just debating back and forth , they are the same people .
we have been talking about the fuel price increases for the last three days .
we know where these motions are coming from .
we &apos;ll do our best to review every aspect of our department in ppd . thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo .
i apologise , mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. chairman .
everybody &apos;s pretty well said what they had to say .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
there has to be an amendment to the motion .
we &apos;ll take a few minutes break while we &apos;re drafting the amendment . we &apos;ll take a ten minute break .
&gt; &gt; committee recessed at 5 : 13 p.m. and resumed at 5 : 27 p.m.
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
we can now start returning to our chairs .
we were almost done .
we can proceed .
thank you .
the amendment to the motion can be read mr. tootoo .
committee motion 46 - 1 ( 3 ) :
amendment to cm 45 - 1 ( 3 )
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman i move that motion 45-1 ( 3 ) be amended to add &quot; trying to keep &quot; after at and delete the &quot; keeping &quot; .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
questions to the amended motion .
james .
hon. james arvaluk :
i &apos;m not fussy over the changing of words because &quot; trying &quot; and &quot; recommend &quot; are the same thing to me in this case .
the only thing that i want to clarify here is that the government is already trying to do these kinds of things .
i think this is clear from this side that we don &apos;t expect to vote against a motion the way it is written .
i just want to make those clarifications .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
i &apos;m all alone and it seems like if i wasn &apos;t chairing i would have a lot of comments to make .
questions to the amended motion .
we don &apos;t have a quorum at the present with the regular members .
do you wish to vote on the amended motion .
we don &apos;t have a quorum .
at this point in time we have no quorum in the house .
i am confused now as to what to do .
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , maybe if we just break for five minutes and just have some discussions .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
yes it would be good to complete this item but when they &apos;re asking questions to us we are always available but because we are asking questions they are walking out .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
we can only deal with the amended motion .
as a government it seems like we &apos;re just going around in circles .
we have to conduct ourselves orderly and we have to respect each other .
to the amended motion are there any comments .
if there are no more further questions or comments to the amended motion , all those in favour of the motion .
thank you .

mr. premier if you have opening comments or remarks .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
the nunavut government and nti have been working hard in regards to nni .
we have established a committee as we have stated on february 22 .
this nni is trying to abide by article 24 of the land claims agreement .
this 27-1 ( 3 ) is trying to reflect the land claims agreement .
we would like to give further support to the private sector in nunavut .
this nni was prepared to follow the business incentive policy to date , but we want to start coming up with a new policy .
i would like to let you know that if we are going to be implementing this then we are going to need to start as soon as possible .
we will have to consult with nti again if we are going to make amendments .
to conform with article 24 we are open to hearing and getting input from my colleagues .
also at this point we are pressed for time but i would like to be open to all of you .
i don &apos;t think we will be able to hear all the comments from the interested parties .
but i will make my office available to my colleagues if they have any comments .
so , that is the objective of this nni .
i also would like to state that if we are going to be utilising the government funding of the nunavut government , we have to give further support to the communities &apos; private sectors .
if there are any comments or questions then my office will be open .

hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :

maybe the tabling of the document is good enough and i would request to adjourn for the day because of the fact that we are running out of time .
we can &apos;t question anything at the moment we will have to adjourn the meeting .

they have input on the nni proposal but nobody recognized the clock from here , and it seems that we are just going all over the place here .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :

arctic winter games / hodgson trophy
hon. donald havioyak :
thank you , mr. speaker .
although we are approaching our first anniversary as a territory , it was at these arctic winter games that nunavut was able to inspire real pride amongst nunavutmiut .
our premier , honourable paul okalik who attended the opening ceremonies at the takhini arena along with several other visitors and spectators from nunavut .
we all agree watching the nunavut team marching into the arena was an emotional experience for us all .
as you know the next arctic winter games will be held in iqaluit and nuuk in the year 2002 .
i took great pleasure in noting that 26 members of the iqaluit host society attended the whitehorse games .
while there , they worked hard to learn from these games and are now in a good position to move forward with the planning of the iqaluit-nuuk 2002 arctic winter games .
during the seven days of the competition , 249 nunavummiut represented our territory in whitehorse .
in all , team nunavut brought home 34 hard earned ulus-11 gold , 10 silver , 13 bronze .
i would like to point out that the most successful medal total was in the arctic sports category , where team nunavut won 12 ulus .
mr. speaker , in addition to the ulus there is one major honour that was bestowed on team nunavut .
the hodgson trophy is an award that was earned by each and every member of team nunavut .
and it is an award we should be very proud of , because it exemplifies the ideals of fair play and team spirit .
in closing , mr. speaker , let me once again on behalf of our government extend our congratulations to all our athletes and team members for a great team effort .

returns to oral questions
return to oq 195 - 1 ( 3 ) lho funding
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker , and if my parents are watching i am smiling at them .
i have 4 returns to oral questions , mr. speaker .
the first return is to an oral question that was asked by mr. tootoo on february 22 , 2000 .
mr. speaker i rise today to provide a response to that question posed to me by mr. tootoo .
the member asked if my deputy minister had any plans to make a submission to reallocate funds to the local level of housing association .
local housing organizations are formula funded .
the formula is based on objective and measurable criteria including the number of units managed by the local housing organisation &apos;s portfolio and the economic condition of the community .
this is determined by the potential revenue and the costs to operate in the particular geographic location
therefore , we cannot consider reallocations of the government surplus .
( interpretation ends ) as stated in the bathurst mandate any surplus funds obtained to improve the current housing staff would be a positive step towards addressing nunavut &apos;s current housing situation .
thank you , mr. speaker .

return to oq 160 - 1 ( 3 ) fuel purchase process

there was another question asked by mr. tootoo on february 17 , 2000 .
mr. speaker i rise today to provide a response to the question posed to me .
the member wanted to know what process is used when there is purchases for petroleum products for nunavut .
ppd has signed a 3 year contract with ntcl to purchase and transport fuel for nunavut .
this contract expires on october 15 , 2001 , with a renewal option for a further 2 years .
the transportation costs will remain fixed for the duration of the contract .

returns to oral questions .
minister arvaluk .
return to oq 248 - 1 ( 3 ) income support program
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker , i would like to reply to the question that was asked by mr. iqaqrialu , the mla for clyde river , on february 28 , 2000 .
regarding to the income support program , the income support program operates on the principals that we need to provide financial support to those individuals in need .
also , we need to encourage as many people as possible to maintain and enhance their independence .
the main way that income support clients maintain and enhance their independence is through productive choices .
there are three types of productive choices for income support clients where safety and worker injuries could be involved .
those three types are where the client is enrolled in secondary or post secondary training program including work experience .
the client is engaged in hunting , fishing or trapping as their major source of income .
also , the third one is if the client is doing volunteer work for an agency or institution in the community .
in the specific interest of volunteer work we understand each agency or institution the volunteer works with is responsible for applying to the worker &apos;s compensation board to cover this type of unpaid worker .
an information bulletin in english and inuktitut has been sent to our regional offices for distribution to income support workers .
we have already distributed to the income support workers and the workers have been advised to verify whether the volunteer agencies have applied for coverage to the worker &apos;s compensation board .
as income support clients are not employees of the program .
i believe the other aspects of the question can be better dealt with the minister responsible for the worker &apos;s compensation board .
thank you , mr. speaker

oral questions .
mr. o &apos;brien .
item 6 :
oral questions
question 257 - 1 ( 3 ) :
office space for decentralization
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question , i &apos;m not sure if it should be directed to the premier or the minister for education .
about three weeks ago i posed some questions to the premier i believe in reference to the decentralization of arctic college jobs to my community of arviat .
there was concern that there wasn &apos;t enough office space available to accommodate these thirteen positions and that it may take somewhat longer to provide that office space .
i would like to ask the minister or the premier about this letter they received about three weeks ago and if there is any progress in this area .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
as the member knows the department is committed to decentralization of all activities .
cabinet has decided that nunavut arctic college would change location from rankin to arviat in support of the cabinet restructured decentralisation plan .
the exact details on the nunavut arctic college move to arviat is still with cabinet and the department cannot and should not comment until cabinet releases this information publicly .
over 50 % of all education headquarters positions are to be located outside of iqaluit .
yes , the government of nunavut is planning to decentralize employees this year .
until the budgets are approved no final decision as to numbers and destination is practical .
we have committed to some but other places we are still working on .
as soon as those are available i am confident that the government will be making a decision soon .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister , mr. arvaluk .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i am certainly not questioning the commitment on behalf of the government .
i think we have all heard in this house both the premier and the minister of education make very firm commitments to decentralising positions to my home community .
i am sure the ministers can understand that there is some interest as to when these jobs will be decentralized .
so i would ask the minister if he could confirm when , a timetable when the people might expect an answer as to your decision on the timing of these decentralized jobs .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister responsible for education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
mr. speaker , i just told the member already that we are working on this .
we have stated that it will be in 2001 for mainly two reasons .
that has to be confirmed by arctic college .
it has been committed to arviat , it is just that we have not yet determined what kind of office space or workstations will be available in arviat .
the letter from the mayor in support of the member is one of the considerations that this government will be looking at .
we are looking at different options as to what is the best and cheapest way possible that we will be able to transfer the arctic college to arviat .
but i can assure the members that we have already committed within the year 2001 and this is our timetable .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister arvaluk .
member for arviat , mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i seem to be getting some conflicting responses to my question .
i raised this issue in the house in february in reference to the timing of the transferring of these positions .
i raised the issue many , many months ago and had the minister of education confirm in this house that these 13 positions would be in place in arviat by july 1st , 2000 .
i since then heard that there were some difficulties in securing office space and it was not available .
i posed the question in february to the premier and the premier indicated to me that if office space were available it shouldn &apos;t be a problem in relocating these positions to arviat .
now the minister is indicating that it will be in the year 2001 .
mr. speaker , i am trying to get a clear-cut answer to this question that i am posing here .
the issue is very important to the people of arviat .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you , mr. speaker .
we had a plan for july 2000 , the member is correct .
it becomes a problem in trying to move in july 2000 .
the government responded and instructed me not to go beyond december 2001 .
if we can move earlier that will be great , i am not telling the member that our plan is now 2001 but the plan is up to this time .
i hope i will need less than that but any kind of consideration for alternate office space to accommodate arctic college will be considered by this government seriously .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk . member for arviat , mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i don &apos;t hesitate for a minute to say to the minister that i do understand and i believe that the commitment is there .
i think that was made very clear by the minister and the premier .
but on the other hand there was a commitment made to myself by the minister and his office , also in this house and also by the premier that the problem was office space .
that &apos;s the issue here .
we have now provided an option for office space , so to me i think it is very simple .
that was the issue , you have confirmed that was the issue in february in the house in rankin inlet .
we have now come forward with an option that is viable .
so i suggest to the minister that there shouldn &apos;t be any difficulty or roadblocks in transferring these positions .
i am not sure how many are coming from this area , how many are moving from the east , i don &apos;t think all the positions are transfers from other areas .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you , mr. speaker .
we have been in discussion with public works .
i have not yet been advised about the recommendations that have been made about the accommodations that we will be moving in to .
that is being analyzed by the people over there .
as soon as we receive the letter from arviat , i will ultimately have to discuss it with cabinet when the recommendation has been given to me by the department .

member for pond inlet , mr. nutarak .
question 259 - 1 ( 3 ) :
decentralization to pond inlet
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is directed to the minister of education .
i read in the nunatsiaq newspaper that in pond inlet if we were to move some positions to communities it would be too costly .
i took it that this particular person didn &apos;t want to move to pond inlet .
somebody will have to relocate to my community .
i am just wondering if we could get some kind of training program in place for those people in my community .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
mr. speaker , we have made a commitment to decentralization and the internal operations as to who will move and who will not move has not been finalized , except for the divisional board .
if the member is talking about the divisional board that has been finalized but for the other positions respecting about the money matter that will also have to wait until the budget is read .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
member for pond inlet , mr. nutarak .

i guess we have to be really looking at our time here .
according to my understanding the planning is going to take a lot of time , according to his answer he said they would strike a subcommittee working with nti .
mr. speaker , my question is , have they already planned and started the committees for this .

mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :

overall cost increase of transporting fuel
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question is for the minister responsible for public works and services .
i would like to thank the minister for providing a cost breakdown per community for fuel and the transportation costs for last year .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister responsible for public works , telecommunications , technical services &amp; housing , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
perhaps if he could clarify his question . there are 26 communities in nunavut that actually get their fuel transported so i would like for him to clarify his question .
in my response to his question it states that the diesel went up by 1 cent and gasoline the price went up by 1 cent and there was no change for jet a1 .
i would like to get further clarification on his question because we transport fuel to 26 communities in nunavut .
is that your question for the whole 26 communities .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you madame minister thompson .
could you clarify your question please .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the minister gave us a breakdown as to how much more the cost was per litre for diesel and per litre for gasoline and indicated that jet a1 was no change .
thank you , mr. speaker .
i hope that is cleared up .

speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :

mr. speaker , it is self-explanatory in my reply .
mr. speaker , it is already stated in here that the cost for fuel products went up by 1 cent and the only one that didn &apos;t change was jet a1 fuel .
so i don &apos;t have that document in front of me , but i have replied to your question on the transportation costs for fuel products and how much the increase was .
it is stated in my response .

question 262- 1 ( 3 ) : social worker for clyde river

thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister for health and social services , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
indeed , mr. speaker , when i was in clyde the member raised the concern at that time .
my understanding , mr. speaker , from the information provided to me is that the position has been vacant for quite a while and that no qualified applicant has come forward .
but , mr. speaker , i should let you know that we have been having some difficulty over the past several months filling social worker positions here in nunavut .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. picco .
member for uqqumiut , mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
yes , i truly believe your response that it is a fact .
however , as residents of nunavut usually we have to be qualified and certified people in order to get a job .
the nunavut government has already stated that we don &apos;t want to see too many certifications .
in my community i have spoken to a person who applied for a job and that person was complaining about why did we hire a person from outside of our community .
this was his concern .
if we are not going to be hiring local people just because they are not certified then we are not going to be learning anything .
as the minister responsible for health and social services i think you have to start being more sensitive to the local people .
even though they are not certified they can be very capable workers .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister responsible for health and social services , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i agree with the member .
earlier i had mentioned that the head of the social workers association for nunavut and the northwest territories and the yukon was here .
mr. speaker , just recently a person who has worked for 30 years in the social work field , with no formal training , was just honoured for her work .
so i agree with what the member is saying , is that it is not all about academics .
mr. speaker , we are trying to train local people for the jobs .
i think there are 3 people right now who are almost completed their diploma in social work in igloolik and some other people who are finishing off their program in cambridge bay .
hopefully some of these people we may be able to look at opportunities to place them in some of our vacant communities .
those people are all from the north .

member for uqqumiut riding , mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :

speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minster responsible for health and social services , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , as the member knows there are some of these issues coming forward concerning inuit qaujimajatuqangit in the budget in regards to the department of health and social services .
i don &apos;t want to get into the details right now as mr. ng will table that budget tomorrow and we are going to have the opportunity to debate that in the house .
not only at the hospital , but with nurses , doctors and social workers and so on .
that is a large task and the member had asked about the position of social worker .
so mr. speaker , we are trying to act and mr. speaker , we are trying to put in place inuit qaujimajatuqangit and there are some good additions coming forward in the budget .

my particular question is in regards to elders and youth programs .
the youth today will have to be encouraged by elders to be able to survive in today &apos;s world .
i am not really questioning the minister about the funding part but when will he put the programs out for elders and youth .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
minister of culture , language , elders &amp; youth , mr. havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
if we get a proper policy and program in front of them and something that they can work with .
nowadays not every elder can read and write and some can &apos;t even write in inuinnaqtun and so we are going to have to work on this program very carefully .
that is why we have these elders and youth conferences so that they can work together on some sort of a policy .
this policy is just about completed and i will be tabling this once the policy is completed as to how it is going to work in the future .
we all know that when people cannot read and write in english we have to try and help them .
also the youth don &apos;t have an idea what to do in regards to inuit qaujimajatuqangit so we have to try and make this policy very carefully .

thank you , mr. speaker .
this is to the same minister , of culture , language , elders &amp; youth .
i hear your response to the questions from the member , but today it has been very evident that the youth and the elders cannot communicate as effectively as they should .
i just wondered what is being done to get the youth and the elders closer .
is there any funding to make sure that the elders and the youth are communicating effectively together .
that is my question , mr. speaker .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister for culture , language , elders &amp; youth , mr. havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
yes i understand your question that the elders and youth have problems communicating nowadays .
i just want to say this once again , i am going to use this for an example .
and that is why we are trying hard to develop this policy .
that way we can get proper programmes for the elders and youth and they can use to learn one another .
so the youth will also be helping elders in return .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i appreciate the response from the minister .
and i would like to ask another question .
how are going to set up a program whereby the elders and the youth can teach each other .
do you have a particular place for them to meet .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
the minister for culture , language , elders &amp; youth , mr. havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) thank you mr. speaker .
i take your question very seriously .
there are different communities in nunavut .
my department &apos;s responsibility is for that .
once again i &apos;m going say we still don &apos;t have the program put together right now .
i &apos;m sending out letters to each community .
we need help from the hamlets to find out what kind of information they can help us with .
that is why we are trying to get this program going .
that is why we are asking help from the hamlets .
i still don &apos;t have a lot of responses from the hamlets but as soon as i gather all the information from the hamlets , i &apos;ll be able to answer your question properly .
thank you mr. speaker .

question 265 - 1 ( 3 ) :
terms of fuel contract
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question is for the minister responsible for public works and services .
again , i would like to thank the minister for providing a return to my oral question on the process used for the purchase of fuels .
i would like to ask the minister , in her reply she talks about a 3 year contract expiring october 15th 2001 .
i &apos;d like to ask the minister when that contract came into place and for what season .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
the minister responsible for public works and housing , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i would like to thank the member for appreciating my response .
if you look at the written response that i gave it said up to 3 years but i don &apos;t have the information as to when it came in to place .
perhaps it is to 2001 from 1999 .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. thompson .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , then i just want to confirm that the minister has stated the contract was in place for the 98-99 season .
is that a correct understanding of her answer .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker , what i &apos;m saying is the contract will expire october 31st , 2001 .
everybody knows that the contract was issued 1998-99 .
this contract was issued just before the nunavut government but i don &apos;t know which date it was because we got our nunavut government in 1999 when the contract was already issued .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. minister .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i just wanted to make sure it was in place for the 1998-1999 shipping season .
on her first reply , it showed a 1-cent increase for gasoline .
in the minister &apos;s second reply , it also states that the cold transportation rate will be fixed over the duration of the contract .
if that &apos;s the case , i would like to know why there is an increase .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
i apologize , during the last session in rankin inlet , we had a 3 day session on petroleum products and there were a lot of questions being raised .
i know we haven &apos;t answered all the questions that were raised then .
what we understand right now is that the contract for this will be a 3-year contract .
however , we will probably have to get more information on this item because we all know that we don &apos;t have all the answers in front of us .
i think all the members know this as well .
however , this is quite self-explanatory because there have hardly been any increases .
or if there were any they were very minimal .
when i responded to that question that was raised there was just a 1-cent increase in gasoline so i don &apos;t anticipate any increases in the future .
however , i &apos;ll look into this again and if the member wants all the statistics i can provide them for him .
but , however i would like to talk to him before this .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. minister .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , before i continue on with my questions i would like to move to extend question period .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
the member is seeking unanimous consent to extend question period .
are there any nays .
there are no nays , so we extend question period for one hour .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i guess i just wanted to get this clarified .
my question is for the minister responsible for public works .
it appears in two oral replies there is conflicting information .
i would just like to ask if she can clarify that and provide us with the information .
i believe she took this as notice .
i just wanted to confirm that .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker , if the returns to oral questions are conflicting then i &apos;ll get back to the member .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. thompson .
the minister is saying she &apos;ll look into this and get back to the member .

mr. nutarak :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i am directing my question to the minister of education .
in pond inlet , there are people in the teacher training program and they &apos;ll be completing their studies this spring .
i would like to know what plans there are for the office they are training in .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
minister of education .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :

mr. speaker , i don &apos;t own the building .
perhaps the minister of public works can answer the question more appropriately .

minister for public works , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i apologize my mind is still on petroleum products .
i didn &apos;t quite get the question from the member .
can the member for tunnuniq clarify the question .
i apologize for not paying attention to the question .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. nutarak can you clarify the question please .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
there are some students in pond inlet taking a teacher training program and they &apos;re utilizing a portable school there .
i just wanted to know what kind of plans they have for after they are finished with this building because the students will be finished this spring .
what plans do they have for this building in the future .
i would like to get an answer from the minister of public works if she can provide a response .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
minister of public works , ms. thompson .
hon manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr speaker .
yes , i understand the question .
the building that is being used at the time , perhaps , i would like to find out who in their community would be interested in using this building or purchasing the building .
perhaps the member could indicate who might be interested in utilizing the facility .
then i can answer his question properly .
thank you mr. speaker .

member for south baffin , mr. akesuk .
question 267 - 1 ( 3 ) :
renovation assistance for homeowners
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
my question is directed to the minister of housing .
the buildings that inuit have owned , like the hap housing , are getting very old .
i know people that own these private houses , which are ageing , and they want to renovate but are not working .
they can &apos;t afford to build extensions .
the inuit started owning these hap houses many years ago .
so i was wondering what plans the minister of housing has in regards to that .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. akesuk .
minister for housing , ms. thompson .
hon manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr speaker .
i think we all understand in here that the budget speech has not been delivered yet this session .
so , i &apos;m not comfortable in discussing what kind of plans we have until we see the budget .
i think we all know today that we cannot respond in detail until we see the budget .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. thompson .
mr. akesuk .
mr akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
the way i understand it is they were not prepared last year .
is that the case .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. akesuk .
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
but we cannot appropriately answer at this time .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister thompson .
mr. akesuk .
mr akesuk :
thank you mr. speaker .
i was asking if the minister or her department was prepared or preparing a plan to help the homeowners of the old hap houses to improve their housing .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. akesuk .
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
some of the homeowners require funding but they have to put in a request for funding to go to the communities , particularly for hap housing programs .
i don &apos;t have the statistics right now for which communities received funding for improvements , but that was usually the case before .
i think this is something that the local housing associations and our department will do together because we are lacking funding for each and every one of the communities that need improvements .
perhaps there are some people who cannot afford to own homes in the communities and there are people who are not interested in purchasing homes because they cannot afford them .
but , we are trying to go forward with this program .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister thompson .

mr. kattuk .
question 268 - 1 ( 3 ) :
sanikiluaq fuel capacity
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
during the october session i asked this question previously and i will be asking the same question to the minister responsible for petroleum products .
in my community spring is in the air and i hear it is plus 2 today .
so , spring is definitely in the air .
last fall , our fuel tanks were not filled to capacity .
therefore i would like to ask the minister for petroleum products if the fuel that was shipped last year will be enough for this season .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kattuk .
minister responsible for petroleum products , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
my colleagues would also like to be asked questions .
in regards to the member &apos;s question , the fuel tank has to be improved that &apos;s why they did not fill it to capacity .
when it is filled to capacity we cannot make improvements to the tanks or maintain them .
so , i would like to assure the community that they should not be concerned if the fuel supply does not seem to be adequate enough for spring hunting .
we can ship and transport this spring if the fuel supply is not adequate .
but we have kept tabs on whether the fuel supply is going to be adequate or not .
at this point in time we are not too concerned until such a time arises that the fuel supply is inadequate and then we will do another order .
thank you mr. speaker .

tabling of mou
mr. o &apos;brien :
&gt; &gt; audio unavailable
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
i have no problem with tabling a document but i would like to have it translated and then i will table the document .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
member for arviat , mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker , i guess i will have to accept that the fact that it has not been translated .
i find it somewhat strange that we have entered into an agreement and signed an mou but it hasn &apos;t been translated upon the signing .
i would hope that before the week was out we could have a copy of that mou in both languages or even three languages .
my question then is , can the premier tell the house what efforts are taking place to move forward on the contents of this mou .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you . mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
more particularly , the road link between nunavut and manitoba .
are there any structures put in place as far as getting a committee to study this important initiative .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the minister for transportation made a statement when we were in rankin inlet that there is going to be a strategy undertaken for all nunavut for transportation .
so the initiatives are in place for transportation and my minister responsible for the power corporation undertook the issue of transmission of power .
so , we are doing work and once the studies are done we will be reporting to the house .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
member for arviat , mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i just want to firm up what the premier said in reference to the power corporation and the possibility of the power grid .
i think that it is also in the mou which we hope to see this week tabled in the house .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you . mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik :
my minister answered that question quite clearly in the last session .
the focus has been to set up our own power corporation and we are making a lot of progress on that .
the minister undertook to review and assess the pre-feasibility study that was done on the power grid .
my minister for transportation is also involved in this process in regards to the road construction .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker i will try to make my question a little clearer .
i &apos;m asking the premier in reference to the power grid , but since we are including the road link , has there been committee work initiated .
there was a promise to review it but has the actual work begun .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , the ikuma group that had worked on developing our own power corporation is starting the work on pre-feasibility study that was done by manitoba and that will be ongoing .

decentralization to igloolik
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , in regards to decentralisation , since the nunavut government has planned to decentralise programs ; my question is to the premier or the minister for finance .
i &apos;m not too sure as to which one i should be asking .
perhaps to the premier .
how could we speed up this process .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , we cannot force anybody to move to a different community .
we are now dealing with people who do not want to move to other communities .
i know that we are going to be dealing with decentralization but we can &apos;t get into detail before the budget speech .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
is the premier stating that if the staff don &apos;t want to move to the communities you will do what ever they say because they are your bosses .

thank you mr. tootoo .
minister responsible for public works and technical services .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
as i already said the budget has not been opened yet and i was surprised to hear that the member is already talking about programs that are probably in the budget .
this is unacceptable and i just want to say that my budget has not been opened yet and i have not made my presentation .
i can &apos;t answer that question .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo , another question .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker , i &apos;m sorry that the minister did not understand my question .
i wasn &apos;t asking about next year &apos;s budget .
i was asking about the supplementary appropriation that is going to be coming forward using this year &apos;s funds .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
at this point in time i would like to confirm that mr. tootoo doesn &apos;t mind not receiving a response .
we will get back to the other orders of the day .
questions .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
maybe it would be more appropriate to rephrase my question .
i would ask if the minister has any plans of putting forth a proposal in some sort of supplementary appropriation regarding surplus of this year &apos;s funds for housing .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister responsible for housing , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i would like to say to the member that we cannot talk about the budget because we don &apos;t have the papers in front of us , or the supplementaries .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister .
mr. tootoo , further questions .
mr. tootoo :
my question has nothing to do with next years budget at all .
it deals with any supplementary appropriations in regards to housing .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson :
thank you , mr. speaker .
perhaps , i think the members of the legislative assembly agree with me , that the housing budget is very important and one of the priorities .
if there was to be any type of extra money in the housing budget then we will definitely be using this for housing .

thank you ms. thompson .

size of budget surplus
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question is directed to the minister of finance .
my question doesn &apos;t pertain to the budget but it pertains to the surplus that the minister has openly provided to the media on 2 occasions .
at one point we were looking at a 10 million dollar surplus .
we are now looking at a thirty to forty million dollar surplus .
could the minister confirm for me today that we might be looking at a sixty million dollar surplus .
would the minister confirm to me today that this is correct or not .

my question is for the premier .
i understand that the premier had a launching of the new nunavummi nangminiqaqtunik ikajuuti , which replaces the old business incentive policy .
i would like to ask the premier if that is the same document that was tabled in the house when we were sitting in rankin or have there been any changes to that policy .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .

mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to ask the premier if he is willing to table that new policy in the house so we can deal with it in the committee of the whole .
so that it is the policy we will be talking about and not the draft policy .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. premier .

there is a letter to me that is a response but it doesn &apos;t have a date on it .
will we be just asking you questions and you won &apos;t be providing us with documents in regards to social services because i just want to get some answers .
i don &apos;t want to say there are going to be people having problems in this regard .
i just want to find out .
my question is to minister arvaluk .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
mr. speaker i didn &apos;t understand what his question is .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu would you clarify your question please .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
there is a letter responding to me which i will read .
i believe that the question is in regards to injured workers .
are injured workers paid if they get injured on the job .
it just states that if there is an injury on the job that it would be up to the compensation people to provide them with compensation .
can you clarify the statement you made in the letter .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s saying .

thank you mr. arvaluk .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i &apos;m very grateful for the response that you have given me .
the other question that i have is that i think there is a committee in regards to social services and there is also legislation amending wcb , not from the nunavut government .
will the nunavut government be providing amendments to wcb policies or legislation .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. minister .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
i cannot answer for the minister responsible for wcb but the legislation is amended or done by the government and whatever the rules or whenever the rules are changed it has to be effected .
there will also be a committee for social services or income support and the money that is being made available for students that are attending educational institutions .
so those committees are set up to look into those things that i am talking about but i cannot answer on behalf of wcb because i am not responsible for wcb .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i thank the minister for his quick response to my questions , however i have another question in regards to that .
there are some people that go to universities and colleges and they can only get in if they have a high school diploma .
so i am just asking the minister if these people can be put into training programs to better themselves .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
i think that is another question that you are asking .
we will be going back to oral questions and we will get a response to your question after our fifteen minute break .
&gt; &gt; house recessed for fifteen minutes
speaker ( interpretation ) :
we have a question and it &apos;s in regards to student financial assistance for those students who would like to further their education in colleges or universities .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
so i would like to ask the minister if he could consider those people that are interested in attending colleges , if they can get assistance mr. speaker .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
mr. speaker , i don &apos;t know if i can understand the question , however i &apos;ll try and answer .
i was trying to say we will be looking into this next week .
however , i was trying to see if there would be any possibilities for those students who don &apos;t have high school diplomas to enter colleges to further their education .
we will be looking into this situation more closely to see how we can encourage the public to seek or get further education .
we will also seek to see if they can have moral support from social workers or something .
i was just using that universities or colleges as an example to see if there were any kinds of possibilities to enter them .

one of the things that seems to keep popping up , and it really hasn &apos;t been looked at very seriously , is the establishment of museums in communities in nunavut .
my question today is to the minister responsible for culture , language , elders and youth .
is he working on a policy to establish museums in every community .

thank you , mr. speaker .
i will let you know though that we will table that but we are still working on it .
i will let you know very soon .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. havioyak .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i really appreciate the minister &apos;s answer .
by the sounds of this he is really taking this as a priority and is working on it and is going to advise us later .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. mclean .
the minister for culture , language , elders and youth .
mr. havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak :
thank you , mr. speaker .
this is something that we are working on very hard so we may be able to see it in the very near future but at the present moment it is an ongoing process .
in some communities there are some museums already in place but then there are other communities who are still requesting museums .
but as we know , things don &apos;t happen over night , so we are still working on it .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. havioyak .
any more questions .
member for arviat , mr. o &apos;brien .
question 277 - 1 ( 3 ) :
medical travel
mr. o &apos;brien :
mr. speaker , my question is directed to the minister responsible for health and social services and the power corporation , and it relates to medical travel .
can the minister tell the house if there is much of a variance i guess , in the cost of travel , whether it is in the keewatin or the baffin .
furthermore how the costs of the travel arrangements are tendered out .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
minister for health and social services and power corporation , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , this is a broad ranging question .
in the session in rankin inlet , i had mentioned in questions and oral questions about a review that we &apos;re undertaking right now to review all medical travel in nunavut .
there are emergency medical evacuations , for example mr. speaker .
so there &apos;s all kinds of different components to travel .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i might add that you &apos;re doing an excellent job today on your first day on the job .
it is my understanding that the cost in the keewatin is actually much higher than what it is in the baffin , though the baffin has a larger population base .
i wonder if the minister can confirm whether this is the case and if it is , why is it so .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
the minister of health and social services , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
one of the issues surrounding the cost of medical travel , as the member knows , for example , here in the baffin region , we have a hospital right in the region itself .
so when we medivac someone from pond inlet , instead of sending them , for example , to ottawa , for health services , they go right directly to iqaluit .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
perhaps you can ask one question at a time .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i don &apos;t think you &apos;d have to be a rocket scientist to understand that if you &apos;re travelling further , of course it &apos;s going to be a greater cost .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
i wish to apologise to the member .
what i was trying to say was that you had already asked two questions .
i suppose you can have a supplementary question .
it &apos;s your final supplementary .
as i stated earlier , you had raised two questions , and i apologize to the member .
the minister of health , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i thank the member for his question .
but you can &apos;t mix your apples and oranges .
mr. speaker , i am trying to answer the member &apos;s question , as it is a serious question , i believe it is .
i am saying that i don &apos;t have the dollar values per travel mile as asked by the member .
i am trying to explain that we do have a working group right now within the department of health and social services reviewing the medical travel and reviewing the total costs .
mr. speaker , i will bring that policy forward . thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. picco .
i want to remind the members that i have to recognize you first before you raise any questions .
thank you .
you have had your final supplementary question mr. o &apos;brien , so therefore you can &apos;t ask any further questions .
thank you .
first we had two questions in one .
that &apos;s the reason why i can &apos;t give you a final supplementary question .

the committee would also like to express its appreciation to the office of the clerk of the legislative assembly for the administrative , research and procedural support it provided .
the committee also thanks members for their support in encouraging qualified constituents to apply for the position .

process
some additional outreach was also done by the chair and assembly staff to encourage people in nunavut to apply for the position .
the following members conducted all of the interviews for the position of conflict of interest commissioner and made the preliminary recommendation to the committee :
hunter tootoo , chair ;
ovide alakannuark , co-chair ;
and olayuk akesuk , member .
it was agreed that applicants would be pre-screened for interviews according to criteria set by the committee .
the pre-screening identified 11 applicants who had northern experience at some point in their careers , 7 of whom had more experience in administrative law or conflict of interest matters .
of these candidates , one was a current resident of nunavut .
in addition , there were two southern candidates who had no northern experience , but extensive experience in a broad range of financial and conflict of interest matters .
after reviewing these 13 candidates , the members of the subcommittee selected three for face-to-face interviews .
a list of 32 oral questions was developed by the committee , to be asked of all candidates in a two-hour interview .
in addition , seven written questions were given to candidates following the interviews and candidates were given 48 hours to return their written answers to the committee .
the committee developed a point system to be used to evaluate the quality of the answers and other information provided by the candidates .
mlas on the subcommittee assigned points to each answer and other materials of the candidates .
the candidates were then ranked in their overall results and the subcommittee discussed the final results of this process .
the committee tried to select for two strengths - legal expertise , particularly with respect to conflict of interest provisions ;
and business expertise , particularly with respect to advising people on matters such as blind trusts , etc .
the committee sought advice from full caucus as to where the members felt the emphasis should be placed .
reference checks were performed and reviewed by the members .
the recommendation was brought forward to the whole standing committee for discussion and a motion , as well as a draft report for their review .
as the legislative assembly was not in session , the report and recommendation were subsequently brought to the management and services board for discussion .
the standing committee wishes to emphasize that all of the candidates interviewed were very committed and qualified for the position .
the decision of the members was difficult and the members approached it in an unbiased manner and in the spirit of collegiality .
it is the hope of the members that all candidates will continue to make contributions to public life in nunavut .
i will now pass on some of the report to mr. akesuk .
thank you , mr. speaker .

position of the conflict of interest commissioner
the position of the conflict of interest commissioner and their duties are laid out in the legislative assembly and executive council act .
the legislation in the nwt has undergone a number of changes over the years .
the amendments in 1996 switched to a single commissioner system , instead of a five-member panel .
ms. anne crawford , a lawyer in private practice in iqaluit , was appointed as the conflict of interest commissioner in february 1997 .
other substantive amendments in 1996 moved from a two-tiered process to a more flexible inquiry by the commissioner intended to respond to the variable nature of conflict complaints .
the 1996-97 annual report of the conflict of interest commissioner also recommended further changes to the legislation .
however , the most recent changes to the nwt legislation were made by the legislative assembly of the nwt in the summer of 1999 , following an inquiry in the nwt .
as well , a separate adjudicator would be appointed in the event an inquiry was needed .
as these amendments were made following division , they are not included in the legislation which was duplicated for nunavut .
nevertheless , it will be instructive for the legislative assembly of nunavut to review them and decide if any would be appropriate for nunavut .
prior to division , the office of the interim commissioner established an ethics and accountability panel to which john amagoalik and roger tasse were appointed .
the panel assisted candidates in the first nunavut election and the elected members prior to april 1 , 1999 .
mr. clark has a full-time position performing the duties of the conflict of interest commissioner of alberta .
the conflict of interest commissioner is an independent officer of the legislative assembly .
on the recommendation of the legislative assembly , the commissioner of nunavut appoints a person who has been recommended for the position .
the conflict of interest commissioner is accountable to the legislative assembly and must report annually to the assembly on the work of the office and any complaints that have been received by the commissioner .
the annual report is required by statute to includes a number of categories of information , such as :
the conflict of interest commissioner also provides opinions and advice to members and comments on the operation of the act .
for example , in the 1997-98 annual report , the conflict of interest commissioner of the nwt issued two general guidelines on &quot; budget voting &quot; and on &quot; question period &quot; ;
three opinions on &quot; participation in nwthc home ownership programs &quot; ; &quot; legal expense funds &quot; ;
and &quot; ownership of shares in publicly traded companies &quot; ; and included a discussion paper on the issue of &quot; blind and management trusts &quot; .
the budget for the conflict of interest commissioner has been allocated to the legislative assembly budget based on the experience of the nwt .
it has not been a full-time position , but rather is part-time , on an as-needed basis .
this budget will need further review in nunavut , once the position is in place .
i will now hand the report over to be read by my honourable colleague .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
observations
as noted in the annual report for 1997-98 of the conflict of interest commissioner of the nwt :
&quot; the commissioner is in a position to advise and instruct as to the appropriate arrangements which will meet the conflicts requirements .
the legislation does not set out the methods or means which the commissioner is entitled to use or recommend .
the discretion and judgement of the commissioner are the primary factors in making these decisions .
the solutions crafted for each member will reflect the commissioner &apos;s understanding of public concern and acceptance in this jurisdiction , and the likelihood and extent of risk of conflict . &quot;
as noted above , the commissioner also attached a number of guidelines , opinions and a discussion paper in the 1997-98 annual report .
there are many challenges ahead .
at the same time , nunavut is a small jurisdiction , with a relatively small private sector .
we want to encourage members in private business to run for office , without undue penalty to their entrepreneurial initiative or family &apos;s livelihood .
a balance must be struck .
and , as with other legislation inherited from the nwt , we need to review the whole act to ensure it is appropriate for and meets the needs of nunavummiut .
the conflict of interest commissioner must recognize and be able to meet these challenges .
the commissioner must be a strong , committed voice for an open government , which makes unbiased decisions that do not personally benefit the members or their families .
the standing committee of ajauqtiit has taken its responsibilities in this selection process very seriously .
the selection process was fair and thorough , and the committee is confident that it has selected an outstanding candidate for the position .
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker at the appropriate time i will give notice of motion to appoint the conflict of interest commissioner .

item 2 :
budget address
hon. kelvin ng :
mr. speaker , today i have the honour of tabling the government of nunavut &apos;s second budget .
as we enter our second year it is appropriate to comment on what we already have achieved .
mr. speaker , nunavut &apos;s first year has been a success .
we have made good progress in building our new territory .
we have established a functioning government .
we have begun to shape our programs and services in a manner that better meets the needs and aspirations of nunavummiut , while operating within our means .
mr. speaker , while we all have a right to be proud , our challenges remain great .
our challenges and priorities
nunavut faces many unique geographic , social and economic challenges .
we are the largest geographic jurisdiction in canada and we have the smallest population .
our communities are widely disbursed , and in many instances have inadequate infrastructure , including housing .
our population is very young by canadian standards and is growing at more than twice the national rate .
this has placed pressure on government to deliver needed programs and services - particularly in the health and social sectors .
our graduation rates are improving , but they are still well below the canadian average .
we need to help our young adults attain a level of formal education that will help them succeed .
we must address these challenges in a well thought out and meaningful way .
if we are to effectively address the priorities of our people , we will have to continue to find ways to do things better and be more resourceful .
we realize that expectations remain high , and we are committed to meeting those expectations .
but we must keep in mind that meaningful change requires understanding and time .
in our first budget , the primary focus was to ensure a smooth transition in governing nunavut , especially the delivery of programs and services for our people .
we committed to creating healthier communities , families , and individuals .
we outlined our intention to work towards making nunavut more self-reliant within canada .
we also recognized the importance of streamlining administrative functions , acting in a fiscally responsible manner , and being more accountable to our people .
mr. speaker , this government has initiated measures in support of all of these commitments .
furthermore , these commitments continue to play a significant role in shaping our approach to governing the territory .
over this past year we have worked hard to identify and understand priorities shared by the people of nunavut .
last fall , we released the bathurst mandate , which presented this government &apos;s vision for nunavut .
this document was the result of a series of meetings involving cabinet and all members of the legislative assembly , including a meeting of our full caucus in baker lake .
there are four major themes contained in this mandate :
healthy communities , simplicity and unity , self-reliance and continuing learning .
mr. speaker , in keeping with our consensus building approach , we undertook an ambitious pre-budget consultation exercise .
the goal of this exercise was to formally seek public input in the setting of budget priorities .
all members of the legislative assembly participated in this exercise , which included public meetings in our 25 incorporated communities .
the more than 900 people that attended these meetings shared their knowledge and opinions about setting budget priorities .
other high priorities that were brought forward during these consultations included : capital and hamlet funding , as well as programs supporting elders and youth , cultural initiatives and economic development .
mr. speaker , the canadian economy enjoyed strong growth in 1999 , and this growth is expected to continue in the coming year .
we expect that nunavut &apos;s economy will be positively affected by these conditions .
business opportunities within nunavut will continue to increase .
we expect our tourism and service sectors to do well .
export opportunities are expected to increase , particularly for fish and meat products , as well as for our arts and crafts .
the development of the nunavut economy will remain largely dependent on the strength of our own initiatives , the self-reliance of our people , and our success in managing our natural resources .
we recognize that government represents the largest single sector in our economy .
we have seen the impact of the creation of our new government in many of our communities .
our challenge is to ensure that the economic benefits of this activity reach as many people in nunavut as possible .
similarly , some nunavut communities are experiencing a construction boom that will continue in the short to medium-term .
but we need to encourage other sources of economic activity .
although we have seen a large number of jobs created over the last decade , the level of unemployment across the territory remains high due to our rapidly growing population and workforce .
we must ensure that the new jobs being created in our economy are accessible by nunavummiut .
decentralization and our investments in education and training will enhance employment prospects .
we must ensure that our people can depend on the land for their livelihoods in the future .
this will require that we continue to support and strengthen traditional economic activities , such as harvesting .
it means that we continue to be innovative in the use of our natural resources by taking the best of our traditional knowledge and merging it with new techniques .
our tourism industry is strongly linked to our natural environment .
we expect this industry to make an increasing contribution to our economy .
the development of our parks and community-based tourism products will expand opportunities for employment .
nunavut is widely recognized for its mineral resource potential .
the development of a mine , such as the proposed meliadine west gold property near rankin inlet , could employ as many as 300 people and generate annual sales of 120 million dollars .
similar opportunities for mineral development exist across the territory .
mr. speaker , to capitalise on potential mineral developments , we will need to assist our residents in identifying and developing opportunities associated with this industry .
we must develop the capacity , through training and education , to assist our people in obtaining mining jobs .
the departments of sustainable development and education have been examining these issues and will soon release a discussion paper on &apos; preparing for mining development &apos; .
mr. speaker , our natural resources extend to the waters around us .
we must invest in our fisheries , an industry that now employs approximately 250 people .
innovative uses of our natural resources must occur in community-based industries such as the arts and crafts .
more than 3,000 people across nunavut depend on this industry for some portion of their livelihood .
arts and crafts continue to be one of the most important exports .
we see continued growth in our arts economy , including the performing arts , film production and cultural tourism .
our economic prospects will continue to expand .
but we will have to work diligently to ensure that nunavummiut benefit from these increasing opportunities , and that we manage our natural resources wisely .
fiscal performance
mr. speaker , nunavut &apos;s first budget , tabled in may 1999 , was a balanced budget .
we forecasted revenues of $ 610 million , operating expenditures of $ 545 million and capital expenditures of $ 55 million .
we set aside a contingency reserve of $ 10 million to cover unforeseen expenditure needs .
in our mid-year budget update we projected that the government would have a surplus of $ 12 million for the 1999-2000 fiscal year .
this surplus was the result of a $ 1.7 million increase in forecasted revenues and a projected $ 10.3 million saving in departmental expenditures .
our projected revenue forecast for the year ending march 31 , 2000 , has increased by an additional $ 7.5 million over mid-year and $ 9.2 million over our budget projections .
this increase is largely due to growth in federal transfers resulting from canada &apos;s strong economy and population growth in our territory .
on the expenditure side , departmental spending projections are $ 14.6 million below mid-year and $ 24.9 million below budget allocations .
in addition $ 17.1 million in funding was provided to our three health boards .
this was comprised of $ 8.2 million that was reallocated within the department of health and social services &apos; approved budget , as well as $ 8.9 million from the savings of other departments .
this latter amount was used to pay off the combined deficits of the three boards accumulated prior to april 1 , 1999 .
a large part of these expenditure savings are of a one-time nature , attributed to the fact that we have not reached our full staffing capacity .
as we will be increasing our staffing levels over the coming year , it is unlikely that we will see similar salary savings in the future .
for the 1999-2000 , fiscal year we now anticipate a surplus of $ 34.1 million .
mr. speaker , our first public accounts , which are to be released this fall , will present government &apos;s actual revenues and expenditures for 1999-2000 .
as in all jurisdictions in canada , our net fiscal position cannot be determined until the consolidated financial statements contained in our public accounts are finalized .
mr. speaker , our departments have operated this year with many unfilled positions , which has placed a heavy burden on many of our employees .
our programs and services have been delivered as a result of their extra time and effort .
our employees should be commended for a job well done .
&gt; &gt; applause
mr. speaker , in january , i announced a 15 percent increase in the northern allowance benefits paid to all gn employees .
this change will take effect for the members of the federation of nunavut teachers , hay plan and excluded employees on april 1 , 2000 .
for members of the nunavut employees union this increase will take effect once a new contract is ratified .
as well , work is underway to review equity between communities that could result in additional northern allowance benefits paid to employees in some communities .
deliver quality education programs to nunavut students .
&gt; &gt; applause
fiscal outlook and plan
mr. speaker , i will now present our fiscal plans for nunavut &apos;s second year of operation .
nunavut &apos;s revenues are projected to be $ 638.7 million in the 2000-2001 fiscal year .
this represents a 4.7 percent increase in revenues over last year &apos;s budget forecast .
this increase is due in large measure to the continued strength in our canadian economy , which directly affects formula financing transfers to nunavut .
it also reflects the one-time increase to the canada health and social transfer ( chst ) announced in the last federal budget .
mr. speaker , all provinces and territories rely on federal transfers , even the wealthiest .
our reliance , at about 90 percent of our total revenues , is the highest of any jurisdiction in canada .
mr. speaker , the budget plan i present today will utilize approximately $ 15.3 million of the $ 34.1 million surplus anticipated from our first year of operation .
this amount will be allocated to departments once a collective agreement is reached with the nunavut employees union .
mr. speaker , in light of the growth in revenues and the projected surplus from 1999-2000 , planned expenditures for 2000-2001 will be increased to $ 654 million .
this represents an increase of 7.2 percent over the planned expenditure allocations in our first budget .
we will be allocating in excess of $ 572 million for operations and maintenance , as well as , more than $ 66 million for capital projects .
this budget provides funding of over $ 14 million for one-time initiatives , not part of our long-term expenditure base .
while there are no tax changes in this budget , we fully supported the income tax changes in the recent federal budget .
since the federal government administers our income taxes , the rate reductions will lower the territorial as well as federal tax burden on nunavummiut .
the increases to child tax benefits will help many of our families .
in order to reduce our dependency on transfers we need to increase economic opportunities , which in turn would strengthen our tax base .
also , we must reduce the cost of providing government services .
changes of this nature cannot be accomplished overnight .
mr. speaker , it is critical that the federal transfers we receive are sufficient to help us overcome a number of significant challenges until we become more self-reliant .
the single most important transfer that nunavut receives is the territorial formula financing grant .
this transfer accounts for approximately 80 percent of our revenues .
the agreement that sets out how this transfer is calculated was signed prior to the establishment of nunavut .
the term of the initial canada-nunavut formula financing agreement was for a two-year period .
it is set to expire on march 31 , 2001 .
in relation to this , the government of canada has put all major transfers to provinces and territories on a common five-year track .
this means that we have an opportunity to enter into a new agreement for an additional three-year period .
nunavut intends to sign a new agreement with the federal government to ensure that this significant source of revenue is ongoing .
mr. speaker , nunavut &apos;s infrastructure and socio-economic needs are significantly different from any jurisdiction in canada .
in this regard , we have been seeking a commitment from the federal government to undertake a review of nunavut &apos;s fiscal requirements .
we will set out our position in a discussion paper which will be released in the coming weeks .
in order to become more self-sufficient we need not only financial assistance , but we also must assume authority and responsibilities over our own resources .
as part of our long-term plan , we are pursuing a devolution agreement with the government of canada to take on the responsibility of managing our subsurface resources .
nunavut would assume the powers to develop , manage and regulate the natural resource base in our territory , and powers to administer and control public lands .
it would give us powers to levy and collect resource royalties and other revenues from natural resources .
these are powers we need .
in nunavut we accept this challenge .
we will continue to work co-operatively with nunavut tunngavik incorporated and the federal government to produce a positive outcome for nunavut .
in a recent letter to me , mr. paul quassa , the president of nti , reaffirmed the organisation &apos;s commitment to work productively with both levels of government on this important matter .
the fact that we have a land claim agreement in place should help facilitate a successful outcome .
mr. speaker , we need the additional authority and responsibility to help ensure our economic development and to enhance our opportunities to move towards increased self-reliance .
mr. speaker , we are committed to reaching an agreement on devolution with the federal government within our mandate .
we are now in the process of preparing a discussion paper that will lay out options and approaches to arriving at such an agreement .
spending plans and priorities
the departments of health and social services and education , along with the nunavut housing corporation , will account for approximately 50 percent of the government of nunavut &apos;s total allocated spending .
this spending is consistent with the bathurst mandate and the priorities identified through the pre-budget consultations .
for the 2000-2001 fiscal year , we will be investing over $ 66 million in capital projects throughout the territory .
when the departments of public works and community government and transportation are included , this figure increases to over 90 percent of the total .
mr. speaker , in last year &apos;s budget we committed to the development of a five-year capital plan .
we have worked hard at developing a sound and balanced capital plan for nunavut .
in developing such a plan we must continuously recognize that our needs are great and that our resources will only permit us to do so much each year .
the longer planning horizon will ensure a balanced approach to addressing the capital needs of all
communities . we will have to be resourceful , creative and practical in our capital planning efforts .
public-private partnering , or p3 , is an example of a resourceful approach to addressing our capital needs .
the p3 process represents a viable financing vehicle for major infrastructure projects .
last spring , the gn successfully negotiated with the arviat development corporation the first p3 project in nunavut .
this agreement will see the construction of a new health facility for arviat .
the government of nunavut is continuing to work towards using this innovative funding approach to construct health centres in rankin inlet , cambridge bay and iqaluit .
in the future other capital projects may be suitable p3 candidates .
mr. speaker , it is our intention to present a preliminary five-year capital plan to the standing committees of the legislative assembly this fall .
this will provide mlas an opportunity to have greater input into the plan before the 2001-2002 capital estimates are tabled .
i will now highlight some of the departmental spending initiatives for the 2000-2001 fiscal year . health and social services
mr. speaker , the department of health and social services will have a total budget of
$ 120.2 million , including over $ 115.9 million allocated for operations and maintenance , as well as $ 4.3 million for capital projects .
over $ 46 million will be provided for medical treatment , and nearly $ 24 million to promote healthy children , families and communities .
in addition , over $ 28 million has been allocated for health insurance programs .
also included in the department &apos;s capital plan is $ 1 million for telehealth .
over the past year we have made a number of important decisions and critical investments relating to the provision of health care programs and services in nunavut .
mr. speaker , last fall the first students in the nunavut nursing program began their training .
a second group of students will begin training this coming september .
with this program we are making an investment in our youth , addressing staffing issues , and developing our capacity to train health professionals .
ongoing funding has been provided for this program , which was given supplementary funding last year from our contingency reserve .
we must compete with other jurisdictions to attract qualified health professionals .
to retain and recruit nursing staff we have reclassified certain health care positions and initiated a program to provide length of service bonuses and a bonus at initial hiring .
these initiatives are similar to measures introduced in other jurisdictions .
mr. speaker , effective april 1 this year , the department of health and social services will directly assume the responsibilities of nunavut &apos;s three health boards .
by concentrating on core health responsibilities we will be able to provide more efficient and effective health care to the people of nunavut .
several administrative and operational expenditure responsibilities previously covered by health board budgets will be transferred to central government departments .
these include payroll and employee benefits , staffing and relocation functions , as well as the maintenance of hospitals and other health buildings , including heating and utility costs .
mr. speaker , the department of health and social services has been allowed to retain in excess of $ 5 million of the funding previously allocated to boards for these functions .
the department will redirect these funds to address a number of fundamental health and social services needs of the people of nunavut .
a core issue for the people of nunavut is the health of our communities .
the most extreme example of mental health disorder is suicide .
we will increase resources for suicide prevention and intervention training , as well as bereavement support for individuals and communities .
mr. speaker , tobacco use in nunavut is at an epidemic level .
it is one of the main causes of death among nunavummiut - 78 percent of our young people between the ages of 15 to 24 are smokers .
the government will commit resources to reverse the trend in tobacco use and to ensure that fewer youth start smoking .
we will examine the development of a comprehensive dental program focused specifically on pre-schoolers .
such a program would improve the dental health of our children .
mr. speaker , with the creation of nunavut , we have an opportunity to address many of our health challenges .
the solutions to our problems will be found in a combination of our traditional knowledge , good management , and modern techniques .
education
the department of education will continue to have the largest departmental budget at $ 150.4 million , including $ 135.1 million for operations and maintenance .
mr. speaker , as with the department of health and social services , the coming fiscal year will bring significant changes for the department of education .
nunavut &apos;s three divisional educational councils will be integrated into the department on july 1 .
for the 2000-2001 fiscal year we will be investing additional resources in a number of critical areas of our education system .
funding of $ 400,000 has been provided for additional inuktitut and inuinnaqtun curriculum development .
this initiative will help preserve and promote the inuit language and culture .
mr. speaker , i am pleased to announce that we will be providing funds to increase the number of teaching positions across the territory .
the department will be investing an additional $ 1.2 million for this year .
we will be making significant capital investments in our education system .
a total of $ 15.3 million has been allocated for capital projects for next year .
the department will be overseeing work on a total of 15 new and ongoing capital projects .
in august of 1998 fire destroyed the killiniq high school and community library in cambridge bay .
construction of the new facility will begin this summer with completion expected in the following year .
this budget allocates $ 7.9 million for this project .
the department will be initiating a number of new capital projects .
included in this budget &apos;s allocation is $ 615,000 to begin the replacement of the jonah amitnaaq school in baker lake .
funding also has been provided for planning school additions in grise fiord , resolute bay and whale cove .
in pond inlet , we are initiating the renovation of the elementary school and examining high school gym expansion options , with $ 1 million allocated for the first year of this project .
over $ 1.5 million has been budgeted for an addition to the quluaq school in clyde river , and $ 1.8 million for an addition to the kugaardjuq school in pelly bay .
mr. speaker , the department of education has initiated a 20-year capital planning process that is designed to enhance the quality of our educational facilities across nunavut .
in addition , mr. speaker , the minister of education , the honourable james arvaluk , will lead the development of a plan for a minor capital program for schools to begin this fall .
through this program we will carry out much needed improvements to many schools across the territory .
funding for this program will come from the accumulated surpluses of the three education councils upon the assumption of their duties by the department of education .
the exact value of the program will be determined this fall when board audits are completed .
the full amount of the surpluses , mr. speaker , will be reinvested in education .
this is another significant investment in nunavut &apos;s school system .
&gt; &gt; applause
we have reached an agreement with the government of canada for the construction of a french language school in iqaluit .
the government of nunavut will contribute $ 200,000 to this project in the coming year .
mr. speaker , nunavut arctic college is in the final stage of developing a new five-year strategic plan .
once approved by the college board of governors this spring , the plan will guide the college in its development and program delivery over the coming years .
we will provide ongoing support for the nunavut teacher education program , which was given ongoing funding from our contingency reserve last year .
in addition , we will be undertaking a review of the student accommodation needs for the three main campuses of arctic college .
in addition to the initiatives outlined above , the department will reinvest over $ 1.5 million to improve the service delivery and the management of the income support program .
as well , the department has budgeted over $ 20 million for adult learning and post secondary education , and over $ 80 million for early childhood education and school services .
housing
mr. speaker , the people of nunavut have told us that addressing housing needs must be one of this government &apos;s priorities .
this past summer , the minister responsible for housing , the honourable manitok thompson , established a task force to examine and make recommendations on housing in nunavut .
minister thompson will lead our efforts in addressing housing issues across the territory .
the government of nunavut will build 100 new public housing units this fiscal year .
the nunavut housing corporation will soon call tenders for the construction of these units , which should be ready for occupancy in early 2001 .
the corporation also has received additional funding to operate approximately 40 public housing units that will be leased from the private market .
mr. speaker , we realize that the demand for social housing far exceeds these increases , but this is a start .
we are committed to addressing our housing shortage in a meaningful , ongoing and efficient manner .
mr. speaker , at $ 19 million the nunavut housing corporation has been allocated a capital budget larger than any government department for fiscal 2000-2001 .
in total , funding of over $ 54 million has been allocated for the corporation .
the nunavut housing corporation is now a stand-alone entity with a mandate to provide public housing programs .
the creation of this stand-alone corporation to develop and oversee the provision of housing programs will ensure that this critical issue receives the attention it is due .
we realize public housing units are desperately needed in all of our communities .
this is why we have made this our number one capital priority .
these 100 new homes will be the first public housing units constructed in nunavut since 1993 .
in addition , the nunavut housing corporation will be increasing funding to local housing organizations by over $ 1 million to offset increased costs , and will continue to deliver programs for homeowners .
justice
for 2000-2001 , the department of justice will have a total budget of $ 37.1 million .
the department &apos;s budget allocates over $ 36.5 million to operations and maintenance , as well as $ 600,000 for capital projects .
the department administers a number of programs , including corrections , community justice , and legal registries .
it is responsible for administration of the nunavut court of justice , for funding and support to the legal services board , and managing the contract for policing in the territory .
we will provide funding of nearly $ 14 million for the rcmp
contract . in this coming year , we will hire probation officer supervisors in each region .
this will begin to relieve some of the workload on community social workers that currently fill this role so they can concentrate more on community wellness plans .
we will provide $ 450,000 for this program .
the department provides a full range of legal services to the government of nunavut .
the department is continuing its initiative to provide legislation in inuktitut , and will be creating new positions for two legal translator positions this year , at a cost of $ 150,000 .
the capital program includes $ 310,000 for maintenance of the baffin correctional centre , and $ 100,000 for correction camps .
culture , language , elders and youth
mr. speaker , the people of nunavut identified many of the responsibilities of the department of culture , language , elders and youth as priorities for government .
the minister of this department , the honourable donald havioyak will lead our government &apos;s efforts in promoting , protecting , and preserving the traditional inuit culture , languages and heritage .
the budget for the department has been set at $ 7.6 million , an increase of more than 20 percent over last year &apos;s budget .
the department has been allocated $ 1 million for capital projects , which consists of $ 500,000 for contributions to youth centres throughout nunavut and $ 500,000 for heritage centres .
sustainable development
mr. speaker , earlier this year the minister of sustainable development , the honourable peter kilabuk , delivered a &apos; statement on the nunavut economy &apos; .
this statement committed our government to developing our economy in a manner that recognizes our dependence on our land and resources , and that draws on the abilities of our people .
minister kilabuk and his department will build on this commitment in the coming year through key investments .
the department is undertaking a complete review of the wildlife act to develop new nunavut-based legislation .
coinciding with this process , the department will increase training and development for wildlife officers in communities .
in addition , we will invest in developing the capacity of our people to take advantage of economic opportunities .
we will spend $ 175,000 on strengthening the capacities of our community-based economic development officers ;

$ 175,000 for community job creation ;
and $ 155,000 for preparing nunavummiut for opportunities in mining education and training .

in total , the department of sustainable development has been allocated funding of over $ 33 million for the coming fiscal year .
community government and transportation
the department of community government and transportation will manage a budget of over $ 78 million , including $ 15.5 million for capital projects .
mr. speaker , this capital budget is the largest of any department , and is second only to the nunavut housing corporation on a government-wide basis .
this allocation reflects the importance we attribute to investing in our communities and their infrastructure .
the department will provide over $ 31 million in grants and contributions , including $ 19 million for the municipal operating assistance program .
in recognition of the demand for change identified in the bathurst mandate , the honourable jack anawak will initiate separate reviews of municipal financing and municipal legislation .

the transportation branch will spend over $ 2.5 million on buildings and works .
public works
the budget for the department has increased by $ 14.7 million over the 1999-2000 allocation .
the completion of these facilities is an important part of our decentralization plans to provide employment and other economic benefits throughout the territory .
also in support of our decentralization efforts , the department will spend $ 2.2 million for the purchase of furniture , leasehold improvements , and the installation of equipment .
the department will assume responsibility for the operations and maintenance of buildings formerly managed by health boards , including utility costs .
this budget allocates over $ 2.5 million for this purpose .
public works is responsible for the operation and maintenance of computer systems and networks supporting government departments .
a budget of $ 10.1 million has been provided for this requirement .
through its petroleum products division , the department will be making significant investments in community infrastructure .
it will spend $ 7.7 million on maintenance and enhancement of bulk fuel storage facilities in communities across the territory .
human resources
the department of human resources has been allocated a total budget of $ 17.8 million , which represents an increase of $ 6.4 million over 1999-2000 .
this increase reflects the significant responsibilities assumed by human resources from other departments , including most of the responsibilities for the staffing and the removal costs of the former health board employees .
human resources will receive additional funding of $ 3.0 million to cover the costs of staff removals to decentralized communities .
the department will be provided over $ 1 million in support of the inuit employment program .
our goal is to develop a training plan that will produce long-term benefits .
the department also will be overseeing the gn summer student employment program ;
$ 350,000 has been allocated for this initiative .
this program will complement the summer employment programs by other departments , as well as an external summer employment program that we are currently developing .
finance and administration
the department of finance and administration has been allocated a total budget of $ 30.7 million , which represents an increase of $ 3.2 million over 1999-2000 .
this increase is largely the result of additional funding for development of computer systems .
we have allocated $ 8 million for the completion of student financial assistance and income support systems , and for other computer systems required by government departments .
funding for new systems will be approved on a priority basis .
also , finance and administration will assume responsibility for the administration of payroll and employee benefits from the health boards .
the department will continue the electrical power subsidy to ensure that all nunavut residents continue to have access to reasonable utility rates .
the cost of this very worthwhile subsidy will be $ 3.8 million next year .
the department of finance and administration is in the process of finalizing the division of assets and liabilities with the government of the northwest territories .
as a result of division , the gn should receive a net distribution of assets valued in excess of $ 15 million , including accounts receivable and inventories of petroleum products .
as well , the nunavut housing corporation will receive equity in capital assets of over $ 70 million .
executive and intergovernmental affairs
a priority area consistently identified by the people of nunavut is decentralization .
the honourable paul okalik , premier , has established in the department of executive and intergovernmental affairs a secretariat to co-ordinate our decentralization efforts .
based on the work done by this secretariat , we have allocated $ 5.2 million for the upcoming year for decentralization .
as outlined earlier , $ 3.0 million will be spent by human resources , with the remaining $ 2.2 million being allocated to public works .
our plan is the full implementation of decentralization over three years .
this will see decentralized communities benefiting from employment and economic opportunities .
the department of executive and intergovernmental affairs will administer a number of government initiatives , including the nunavut public utilities board and the nunavut law review commission .
the mandate of this commission will be to review the current laws to ensure that they reflect the values and needs of the residents of nunavut .
the opinion and participation of elders will be given special consideration during this review .
funding of $ 2.6 million has been allocated to the department in support of the establishment of the nunavut power corporation .
the minister responsible for the power corporation , the honourable ed picco , will oversee the start-up of a nunavut-based utility .
the total budget for the department of executive and intergovernmental affairs has increased from $ 7.7 million in 1999-2000 to $ 11.3 million for the coming year .
this increase covers the cost of establishing the nunavut power corporation , the nunavut law review commission and the nunavut public utilities board
mr. speaker , premier okalik has successfully established partnerships between nunavut and other jurisdictions .
a memorandum of intent with greenland will encourage closer ties with our neighbour to the east .
a northern leaders &apos; co-operation accord with the northwest territories and yukon will result in collaboration on issues of mutual interest .
a memorandum of understanding with manitoba that will benefit both jurisdictions .
in addition , mr. speaker , the premier has signed the clyde river protocol with nti to formalize our working relationship with that organization .
all of these partnerships will prove to be invaluable as nunavut moves forward .
conclusion
mr. speaker , nunavut &apos;s first year has been a success .
we have made good progress in building our new territory .
in our first year of operation we have maintained and enhanced programs and services , while being fiscally responsible .
we have worked hard to identify and understand the needs , aspirations and priorities of nunavummiut .

we have put more resources into education , housing and health care .
we are supporting our culture , heritage and traditional economic activities , while preparing our people for the new millennium .

we must build on this momentum .
by continuing to invest in our greatest resources - our people and our land - we can ensure nunavut &apos;s prosperity .

baker lake students at london science fair
mr. mclean :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the national science fair in london ontario will be the next stop for two baker lake students who captured top honours at the kivalliq regional science fair in rankin inlet .
baker lake &apos;s chris cooper and richard lemier won first prize their polarised sun glasses project .
cooper a grade 7 student and lemier a grade 9 student , both from the jonah amitnaaq school say the idea for polarised sun glasses came from a grade 9 text book .
they modified it so it would involve inuit heritage and culture by comparing polarised sunglasses and inuit snow goggles .
their conclusion surprised them mr. speaker .
they thought the polarised glasses would block out more light .
but the snow goggles actually ended up blocking out more light .
proving that snow goggles are superior to polarised sunglasses .
these young men will be taking this message to all of southern canada .
the message is that not all modern technology is superior .
i would like to take this time to thank all the organisers and volunteers who arranged this yearly event .
especially calm air and sakku investments .
thank you , mr. speaker .

member &apos;s statement 203 - 1 ( 3 ) :
recreational facilities for smaller communities
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i envy some of the members who are sitting here because even the smaller communities do have their recreational facilities .
prior to the arctic winter games starting i am sure the communities lacking recreational facilities , i hope they do get their recreational facilities prior to the arctic winter games .
the recreational facilities are very beneficial to our young people to live a better , healthier life .
in regards to recreational facilities some of the smaller communities don &apos;t even have recreational facilities .
so , therefore i request that they be treated equally so they will be allocated an equal amount of recreational facilities prior to arctic winter games 2002 comes into effect .
we all need to have proper recreational facilities in all the communities .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :

item 6 :
oral questions
question 278 - 1 ( 3 ) :
housing corporation capital spending
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker my question is for the minister of finance .
i would just like to confirm that there isn &apos;t a misprint on table 4 of the budget address .
it states that the capital spending for the nunavut housing corporation for the year 20009 / 2001 is lower than the spending last year .
i would like the minister to confirm that this is actually the case , that the overall capital spending for the housing corporation has been cut .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of finance , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i referred to table 4 , is the honourable member speaking about the 19 million and 60 thousand referred to in 1999 / 2000 versus the 19 million . the 60 thousand difference .
if that is what he is referring to then he is correct .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
could he explain to the house how this is consistent with his budget address in which he stated that housing is one of the two core priorities for this government .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of finance , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
mr. speaker , i would say that it is consistent in how you re-profile the dollars within the department or the contributions to the housing corporation to begin with .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
it &apos;s printed in the bathurst mandate that housing is one of the top 2 priorities and there is an actual decrease in funding for it .
i can &apos;t believe that happened and look forward in getting an explanation to how that could have happened .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
the honourable member is suggesting that 60,000 decrease .
it &apos;s like an adjustment .
we &apos;re talking about 19 million dollars and the honourable member thinks 60,000 are significant .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
oral questions . mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
my next question is for the minister of finance .
i asked for some clarification mr. speaker on table 1 on the summary of fiscal position for the government of nunavut .
on the year 2000-2001 main estimates , it has estimated appropriation lapses of 5 million for capital projects .
mr. speaker my interpretation of that is they plan of lapsing 5 million dollars for the capital .
i &apos;m just wondered if its money they plan on lapsing .
why is it in the budget .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
you were asking a different question than your first one .
minister of finance mr. ng , would you like to respond .
hon. kelvin ng :
mr. speaker , the plan is to carry over approximately 5 million dollars .
capital projects for the 99-2000 year that will not be completed on march 31st .
so , there is approximately 5 million dollars that will go over to the 2000-2001 year .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
i just like to thank the minister for clarifying that .
so , than that 5 million out of this year &apos;s capital projects that &apos;s going to be carried forward to the next years capital projects .
is that correct mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of finance mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
yes that is correct .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker i &apos;d like to ask the finance minister if during the departmental briefings if we &apos;re going to be provided with what projects the 5 million-dollar consists of .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister ng .
hon. kelvin ng :

yes , we will try to provide as much information as any member wants .

oral questions .
mr. iqaqrialu .
question 279 - 1 ( 3 ) :
budget detail
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i have a question also to the minister of finance .
in reference to the budget information that we received .
i don &apos;t have any detail .
i &apos;m assuming that when we access to further information we &apos;ll get the information required .
but under page 25 and 26 it says that the keewatin and the baffin .
it says the baffin region and the keewatin .
there &apos;s reference to the baffin and the keewatin regions that when you look at the numbers they all indicate 0 for the year 2000 and i &apos;m wondering why this is the case .
i just would like to clarify that for me mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
finance minister , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , the honourable member may be referring to the 2 departments , the legislative assembly and the executive and intergovernmental affairs where there is no distribution of budgets outside of headquarters .
having said that all the departments have the details .
they &apos;re the ones that provided and we summarised it in the budget estimates .
when it comes before the committee of the whole , all the details will be provided as much as possible .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
in reference to the detail of the budget .
there is a great difference in the numbers provided and thank you for telling me that we will be getting the finer details .
but when you look at the breakdown of the dollars , it &apos;s difficult to assume what the numbers are and i &apos;ll be looking for the information later .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
i did not hear a question .
orders of the day .
oral questions .
mr. nutarak .
question 280 - 1 ( 3 ) :
distribution of income support programs
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
at that time he said he would gather information throughout the winter months .
and , i &apos;m just wondering if he has collected the data required for the information particularly for the baffin region .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
hon. james arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , no we have not done that at this time .
but , the staff is working on it .
i was asking for the comprehensive review as to the income support program and how they are being distributed .
this has been an on going effort and as we know the department has not been expanded since 1995 .
and , so we wanted to do a whole review .
so in the following week , i &apos;ll be able to inform you as to who will be in the working group .
they &apos;ll be coming to your communities for visits for consultations .
and , they &apos;ll also be some discussions as to whether there should be a whole meeting to that effect .
at first i was thinking , mr. speaker , that maybe they should be able to meet and discuss the issue that the member raised concerning the baffin region .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
the minister indicates who will be on that working review committee members in the following week .
i understand that this has been on going for a while now and he said it hasn &apos;t been worked on .
i know that the people who receive the income support cheques in different forms .
so he says there will be people that will be doing a review .
how soon does he expect the committee to perform the review .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
the review will be comprehensive .
for example , for those who get income support , they only need temporary aid .
for example people who work throughout the summer months need to get unemployment insurance benefits .
because it &apos;s such a tedious process that they come to income support for assistance .
and so we &apos;ll be looking at all the aspects of the income support programmes and i look forward to working with the yukon and the territorial governments .
the ministers on the area are planning to meet in whitehorse to discuss these issues along with the federal government minister regarding income support programmes .
this is scheduled for late may , early june .
so what i &apos;m trying to say to the member is all of the programmes will be comprehensively reviewed concerning income support along with the student financial assistance from arctic college programmes .
all of these components will be looked at .
i look forward that we should have the information at the end of three months .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :

supplementary to my question regarding income support to the minister .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
no i will not .
what i was trying to say was this .
what forms of review will take place .
we want to look at the individual components , we want to be able to discuss all the components either by teleconference or in person .
we want to get access to people &apos;s suggestions and ideas and consult with the people .
we want to make it an all-inclusive review over the next three months .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
my final supplementary to my question to the minister responsible for income support .
in my first preamble to my question , i indicated that income support cheques are distributed in different forms in the baffin region .
people are interested in obtaining a response as soon as possible where by they can get their cheques issued is a consistent manner across the board .
this was my question last fall and now he tells me he can &apos;t answer me until a few months from now .
so this is a question dating back to last spring .
it involves the distribution of income support cheques .
if i could go back to that , i may have to repeat myself in june and i understand that i &apos;ll be able to getting a response only then .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
although i did not hear a question , you may respond mr. minister .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i myself did not hear a specific question but i would like to respond anyway .
it being friday i can go and find out right away .
in fact this coming week i can give him a written response because there are different reasons for many different forms of distribution .
it depends on you status and your family members .
and so even if i don &apos;t give him specific numbers at this time as to how things are distributed differently .
i can give the information next week .
thank you .

question 281 - 1 ( 3 ) :
capital spending for the department of education
mr. akesuk :
( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question will be directed to the minister of education .
in written form looking at the information that was presented concern 15.3 million dollars allocated for capital projects .
according to the written information i had not seen in front of him whether there is room for expansion under the capital projects because their classrooms are filled to capacity .
our population numbers continue to grow and for the job entrance numbers , we also expect an increase for the working force .
and this figure of 15.3 million dollars seems to me there should be expansion of school .
that is my question to the minister .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. akesuk .
minister of education .
mr. arvaluk .
hon james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
yes , what we do is put together .
somebody was mentioning clyde river , pond inlet and kugarjuk schools .
as well as schools in repulse bay .
just make a brief comment .
i could indicate individually say for example in baker lake it &apos;s a health hazard .
you walk into the school and there are pieces falling on your head .
we can also say concerning the schools in other regions , for example in kugaruuk they &apos;re very overcrowded .
that for the five year plan , these capital projects which are bound for the schools are not defined well enough in the 5-year plan .
we want to do is a 20 year plan instead .
so that we can assess emergency growth and other issue like that expansion of population numbers per capita numbers .
is there an economy that is prosperous .
all these other issues that have to be looked at and we &apos;re going to start this 20 planning basis rather than a 5 year plan .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
he indicates that he plans to do a 20 year planning assessment .
you have many communities within nunavut , will it take a while before these communities will be reviewed or will there be done on a priority basis .
thank you mr. speaker .

back to our orders item number 6 , oral questions .
member for amittuq , mr. irqittuq .
question 282 - 1 ( 3 ) :
inadequacy of hall beach school
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
before i raise a question i would like to thank the people that i stayed with in rankin inlet .
i tried to thank them yesterday but they didn &apos;t hear me over the tv .
however my question is directed to the minister of education .
as he indicated if there are safety hazards in schools or there is overcrowding .
then it becomes a priority .
in the capital plan , i indicated that my community school should become a priority because it &apos;s become too small .
we have requested an expansion of the school for the last 5 years and they have extended up to grade 8 .
they have not done anything about this expansion .
now they have the school is too small now for the students who are attending .
perhaps the minister can look into this .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
mr. arvaluk .
thank you , mr. speaker .
there was a plan that would continue to be utilized as it was because they didn &apos;t have any health or safety hazards in that school .
so they thought that maybe they could still use that school for a number of years .
there were some other schools that were a higher priority .
when we went to pond inlet we entered the school and there were classes even being held in the hallways .
thank you , mr. speaker . during our first session last year i tabled a petition coming from my community requesting a school expansion .
aren &apos;t these things considered urgent .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the plan that we used required funding and as we indicated there are some other priorities that we have to consider especially when it concerns health hazards .
they didn &apos;t even have any contractors to do the work , although they already had the designs planned within the five year capital plan .
yes i can see that hall beach has an overcrowding problem but there are other communities that need more attention right away .
i know that there were some plans made for some schools but they didn &apos;t go ahead with the plans .
therefore , like i indicated we decided that maybe it would be best to have a 20 year capital plan so things could be in better shape in the future .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
member for amittuq , mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
yes i understand his response and his concern .
it is his job to decide which schools need more attention and which should be a priority and i understand his response .
however , i am representing my community and they have had their concerns raised regarding schools .
one of my constituents asked this very same important question and he indicated that he would be happy to deal with this issue right away .
i just want clarification on this response he made to one of my constituents .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i think i understand where the member is coming from .
at the time when we had the meeting i stated that if the school is too small for the students and it is becoming a serious problem that perhaps we could consider it .
however , we have said this to every community in nunavut .
that &apos;s why we would like to do this comprehensive review and forward it to the communities so we could work well together with the community .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
going back to the orders .
oral questions .
perhaps , if i can just remind members that during oral question period if you get a good response from the minister please try and make your supplementary questions short .
this is just a reminder to the members .
if you have supplementary questions , try and make them short please .
oral questions .
mr. o &apos;brien .
question 283 - 1 ( 3 ) :
criteria for culture , language , elders &amp; youth funding
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , sometimes on this side of the house we don &apos;t have any questions and sometimes we have too many .
i am just trying to sort out who is going to be the lucky minister today ;
i have questions for education , for culture , language , elders &amp; youth , minister of housing , the premier .
in yesterday &apos;s budget speech , the minister of finance made a nice presentation on the budget .
there were many good things in the budget , i guess there were a lot of things i would like to see there but unfortunately that &apos;s the way it is .
there are only so many dollars to go around .
my question then today is to the minister responsible for culture , language , elders &amp; youth .
mr. speaker , the minster of finance indicated that there was 500 thousand dollars allocated for youth centres throughout nunavut .
i know for a fact that my home community of arviat will get very excited about this funding and would like to know how to access it .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister of finance , mr. ng .
i &apos;m sorry , minister for culture , language , elders &amp; youth , mr. havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to answer this a little bit later , but mr. speaker , on the 500 thousand dollars for youth centres .
that is how it will be dealt with , perhaps that will answer your question .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. havioyak .
mr. o &apos;brien , member for arviat .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i don &apos;t think the minister , as a matter of fact the minister did not answer my question .
is there criteria in place for the allocation of this money .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister of culture , language , elders &amp; youth , mr. havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
today we have finalized these types of applications for funding for such projects .
i will try to answer your question .
this application we use will be handled through the department to decide who will get the funding .
we will look through the process in the department once the regions have requested contributions or grants from our department for these grants we will go through this process .
if i didn &apos;t answer your question , i will try to answer your question through the written statement that you make .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. havioyak .
member for arviat .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , the minister is correct he did not answer my question .
we are on oral questions , this is not posed as a written question .
i hope this is not just the tip of the iceberg as far as what funding is being proposed here for various projects .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister for culture , language , elders &amp; youth , mr. havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i understand the question , and i apologize .

thank you minister havioyak .

item 6 on the orders of the day .
mr. tootoo .
question 284 - 1 ( 3 ) :
increase in northern allowance
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to ask the minister why , as he had indicated in january , why it is not taking place on april 1st .
thank you mr. speaker .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister of finance .
member for iqaluit centre , mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
based on that announcement they would have anticipated they still might want to negotiate but on top of the fifteen percent increase prior to that .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
minister of finance , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , as i indicated we are in active negotiations now with our partners , the northern employees union .
i don &apos;t think it would be proper to discuss any of those details at this level .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. tootoo , your supplementary .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker i believe , reading the press release of january seventeenth , it is out there for all employees effective april 1 .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
minister of finance , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
once again , i will just say that they are aware of the proposal .
but having said that mr , speaker , let &apos;s remember that any agreement that is ratified is retroactive to april 1 .
so nobody is losing from that perspective .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
oral questions .
item number 6 in our orders of the day .
member for baker lake .
mr. mclean .
question 285 - 1 ( 3 ) :
income support &amp; tax considerations
mclean :
thank you , mr. speaker .
tax time is coming and going and with the creation of nunavut a few items have been pointed out to me in regards to t5007 supplementaries and t4 slips for this accounting year .
if this error is not caught and the duplicate 5007 is not cancelled the family income is essentially doubled .
this could effect the calculation of gst and child tax credits by the canada customs and revenue agency .
tax filers may experience a reduction in their year 2000 tax credits .
is the minister aware of this and what measures has he taken to see that these badly needed income tax refunds are not jeopardised .
thank you , mr. speaker
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. ng for the department of finance .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
no , mr. speaker i am not aware of that problem but certainly if it is a problem we will act upon it to rectify it so our constituents are not adversely affected .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my second question is that in april 1999 the canada customs and revenue agency notified nunavut employers that a result of the creation of nunavut , employers would be required to issue two t4s .
one for the nwt earnings and the second for the nunavut earnings .
we enclosed a copy of the processing .
is the minister &apos;s department on top of this to make sure that we get the revenue we deserve .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
minister for finance mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
first of all mr. speaker the member is correct because the territory of nunavut came into existence on april 1 , the government employees would have transferred over as far as their employer goes .
not just for the government but for any other organization that is operating in nunavut .
but in the instance the member raises about tax collection .
of course members realize that the federal government undertakes on our behalf the collection of our taxes on the part of the filing of annual tax for deemed residents on december 31 , 1999 .
so if someone was to deem nunavut as a residency that is where the taxation revenue for that tax rate for the provincial or territorial portion of that would go .
so in other words we would not lose out provided that individuals residing in nunavut claim that their place of residency was nunavut on december 31 .
now i will check with my officials that all the information that i provided is correct but that is my understanding mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the accounting firms in nunavut have been notifying me regarding what they have seen in certain circumstances where t4s have been issued from one territory .
the reason i bring this up is that the smaller communities like my own rely on these tax refunds to purchase boats and motors and snowmobiles and stuff like that .
i will be inundated with questions and concerns and i just want the honourable minister to confirm that this will be taken care of .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. mclean .
minister of finance , mr. ng .

thank you for returning to the house .
before we begin there is a new information item .
our sergeant at arms , jayco ishulutak has just received a granddaughter this morning .
congratulations to the sergeant at arms .
going back to our agenda .
minister &apos;s statement 50 - 1 ( 3 ) , tabled document 27 - 1 ( 3 ) , and also bill 13 , and tabled document 41 - 1 ( 3 ) .
we were dealing with this tabled document .
do you want to proceed with this item .
i am going to ask our premier to go to the witness table with his witness .
my apologies , they don &apos;t have a microphone set up at the witness table .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
that &apos;s okay .
i will try to answer any questions .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
the premier is sitting at his seat right now and he will try to answer questions appropriately .
mr. premier do you have any opening remarks .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i already made my opening remarks in rankin inlet .
but if there are any questions i am open to trying to answer them all right now as we have all the information items with us .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
i think we can proceed now .
comments from the members .
who wishes to have the opening comment .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
i was just looking to ask some questions of the premier .
i have no opening comments to make .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i already made my opening statements in rankin inlet during our last session so i am just here for questions .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
comments or questions from the members .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , overall i don &apos;t have any great reservations about the document .
i might add that i was a little disappointed that we didn &apos;t have an opportunity to discuss the document and debate it in the house before it was released last week .
the option they will have is that the contractor will only be forced to purchase up to 100 thousand dollars from the local contractor .
if it were higher that would provide more business opportunities for the local contractor .
can you explain the rationale for that .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you mr. chairman .
so the intent of that limitation for that first 100 thousand dollars .
but for services in nunavut there is no limitation .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
we are discussing tabled document 50 - 1 ( 3 ) .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i realize now that it is only goods and that explains my second question .
i think we all realize that we have to get our wooden materials from down south at this point .
chairperson :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you mr. chairman .
the first 100 thousand dollars , for the northern person that provides supplies it would give them an incentive .
they will be provided bonuses .
so if they are just providing supplies and they are just getting supplies from the south , that does include a lot of benefits for the people of nunavut .
but for the first 100 thousand dollars they will get a benefit through this policy as well .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you premier .
premier maybe you can shed some more light on this issue for me and i don &apos;t have a total grasp of the whole picture here but i think i have a general idea .
just getting some help from my colleagues here , but it is not very constructive help .
if for example , a southern firm , because we still have a grandfather clause in here , there is a sunset period of two years .
they then can go elsewhere for the rest of the materials .
is that correct .
chairperson :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you mr. chairman .
they can go wherever they want , but i am sure that if they produce the goods here in our territory then they will get preferential treatment .
the policy is directed towards nunavut businesses and providing incentives for them to benefit from any contracts that we issue as a government .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
now going to the grandfather clause , i would like to know if the premier could explain how they make a decision on allowing the grandfather clause to take place .
i know there are a number of companies , many companies from the south or outside of nunavut , that should be grandfathered .
of course there are probably just as many others that shouldn &apos;t because they probably haven &apos;t contributed as much to nunavut .
so i would like to ask the premier how do they come out with a rationale to make this decision .
i assume that they are companies that are now doing business in nunavut .
is that the case the way the grandfather clause will operate for the next two years .
chairperson :
premier .
hon. paul okalik :
if you look at past practice , businesses are quite adaptable . if you look under the land claim agreement inuit firms will get some status under government contracts .
before the land claim agreement was signed there weren &apos;t that many companies and look at today , how many inuit companies are there . there are numerous inuit companies .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
yesterday we tabled the document and i am just asking mr. o &apos;brien if he is referring to that particular document that was tabled yesterday .
mr. o &apos;brien :
yes , i am mr. chairman , asking questions in reference to the document .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i apologize , this tabled document that was tabled yesterday is not in our orders of the day .
i think we are dealing with a document that was tabled in the rankin inlet session .
i think we should be referring to that one first , as this is not on our agenda at this time .
if you could understand me . mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
in regards to nni policy , minister &apos;s statement 51 - 1 ( 3 ) i will be posing further questions under this .
under the land claims agreement , article 24 , we should be covering this .
i want more clarification on this from the premier .
chairperson :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
before we tabled this particular document , the previous one we had didn &apos;t even have a number on it when it was introduced .
they will be given more programs and services and if these private business owners are inuit people they will be receiving assistance and services .
we will have inuit businesses assisted as a priority and we had the assistance of nunavut tunngavik incorporated when we were drafting the ikajuuti policy or the nni policy .
i hope i responded to your questions .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
in his previous opening remarks he had stated that i am very pleased to table the policy to the legislative assembly and i expect to hear input from the regular members of the assembly .
so that is the last remark that he had made in the rankin inlet session .
perhaps , i am sure that he was expecting to get input but we heard on the news on the radio that the premier would take this nni into effect by april 1st .
so i was wondering if he will implement this on april 1st , even though he did not get any input from the regular members .
that is why i want further clarification .
chairperson :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i did the opening remarks and stated at that time that i would give the members another week to consult and get input from my colleagues .
we kept that open for anybody but i did not hear any input from the members and we had to implement this and bring it into effect for april 1st .
the private businesses will have to be consulted prior to april 1st .
in view of that we have to consult with the communities .
if we defer this policy we would have to use the old policy , which does not reflect inuit needs .
so therefore the contracts will be coming up in the new fiscal year and the private businesses which belong to inuit people won &apos;t have the opportunity if we use the old bip .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
i am not anticipating the completion of this yet , but our premier stated that this would take effect on april 1st .
he did his opening remarks last month .
did you consult with all the interested groups or private businesses whether they had a problem with this policy prior to april 1st .
or because the nni is going to be in effect on april 1st that is why you had put this information on the radio .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
the public has heard about the nni policy since we started in july last year when we started working with nti and we struck a subcommittee in december .
they held meetings with various interested groups last year and the public was invited to have input to the policy if they had any concerns .
after we heard the concerns from the public we incorporated them into the draft policy .
in february we dealt with that again in rankin inlet .
there were people who were quite concerned and we got their input and made amendments to the nni .
i would like to thank those people who gave us their input .
chairperson :
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
my last question in regards to the policy .
nni policy , i would like to ask the premier as to how long he dealt with this policy .
did it take him a year or a week to complete the nni .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
i am sorry , we struck up a subcommittee to consult with the public .
if we run into any problems we will be able to make amendments any time .
so therefore we would like to review it again by next year .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
i have on my list mr. mclean and mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. chairman .
it has been a long time coming , this policy .
i am relieved , probably more relieved than anyone in this room , because i am a long-term businessman , to see it finally in writing .
i think it is going to help all of us work closer together .
i am glad that this government has finally showed some initiative to bring a policy forward that reflects the business interests of nunavut and i fully support it .
when i was contracting my biggest concern was not necessarily falling within the guidelines of a policy .
the old business incentive policy was twenty days upon invoice received .
a lot of these communities don &apos;t have banks so it is very difficult to get paid and we all know what the mail service is like in our communities .
when a cheque is cut by the department of finance within the twenty days it could take another twenty days to get it to the contractor .
by then the contractor is calling the bank begging for a higher operating line .
i don &apos;t think the larger companies would argue with that either .
one of the things that i would like to see implemented in this , mr. premier , is a contracting invoice on a progress report paid within fourteen days .
i know whoa ! whoa ! all the people running around saying this is impossible to do .
the thing is the second largest employer in nunavut and probably the biggest trainer of the work force is the private sector .
so mr. premier i wonder if you would consider making the pay period on progress claims fourteen days .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik :
right now every vendor is twenty days so everything is twenty days but we are open to suggestions and that is a wonderful suggestion .
we will look into that .
thank you .
mr. mclean :
thank you , that is great news and i think the business community will be applauding that sort of policy decision , i know i sure would .
so i figure with my business connections and my business experience as a small businessperson that i could probably supply these goods and compete with the larger firms .
if i tendered on the project and i didn &apos;t meet the criteria of what a northern supplier is then you had no chance because you didn &apos;t stock an inventory .
that is one of the things that was frustrating in the past for small businesspeople to get into .
we &apos;ve got to remind ourselves and the civil servants forget about this .
if you look now there is probably only 4 or 5 major suppliers of building materials in nunavut .
sometimes small business can &apos;t get to the next step because of what we throw at them and i have experienced this numerous times and i have heard other people say it .
so i wonder if you have considered that in this policy .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you , mr. chairperson .
as i stated before we are removing any application policy for businesses outside of nunavut . so that is a start , that the policy provides benefits for businesses inside nunavut .
so , if you provide additional benefits to the community such as employing or creating inuit employment you will get benefits out of the policy .
they have a higher chance if they provide adequate benefits to the people of nunavut .
thank you , mr. speaker .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
time is ticking and if you have any questions please try to ask your questions briefly because we have to recess by 2 o &apos;clock .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you , mr. chairperson .
i have about 3 questions and i &apos;ll try to make them short .
mr. premier on this policy i don &apos;t see anything for incentives for northern manufacturing to start .
is this being looked at .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you mr. chairman .
i hope that we get into that in the future .
the first one hundred thousand dollars is covered for suppliers .
but if we can manufacture our own goods then i &apos;m sure we can draft a policy once there is a sector .
maybe there is one right now , i &apos;m sure that we can look at that in the future .
thank you .
chairperson :
thank you mr. premier .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
that is very good news also and i would like to know when .
but my second question is if contracts that are carried over from last year that have additional funds this year , will this policy affect it .
thank you .
chairperson :
premier .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you mr. chairman .
all contracts that were signed last year or even up to the first are under the old policy .
the new policy is initiated after april 1 , 2000 .
so all businesses will continue to be covered under the old policy until april the first .
thank you , mr. speaker .
chairperson :
thank you mr. premier .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
i feel like i am pressured to ask questions and be short because i could go on for hours about this policy .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you , mr. speaker .
we are trying it for this year .
the old policy covered hamlets , but it was never enforced .
but we do have provisions in the new policy that deal with monitoring and enforcement .
so , each of the departments that contract out will be charged with enforcing the policy .
so they will be challenged this year for hamlets , but i &apos;m sure we will have to review it .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
since this has not been tabled the reference keeps referring to the previous tabled document .
even though these are not on the order papers .
i think now we will discuss topics from mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman that is one thing i would like to clarify , because right now we are discussing according to the chairman , the draft document tabled in rankin inlet .
i have questions on some of the changes and things like that .
i think we should be able to talk to the policy itself .
not a draft policy that no longer exists .
so i &apos;ve got some general questions .
chairperson :
thank you .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you mr. chairman .
the reason why we just looked at goods is because the shipment of goods doesn &apos;t provide many benefits for the people of nunavut .
so , there is a twenty percent incentive under the policy .
so , those are the limits in place on bids that are given to nunavut government on contracts issued by the nunavut government .
thank you .
chairperson :
thank you mr. premier .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
now twenty percent of 10 million dollars , is it costing that individual or company that much more to do that business in the north .
can we afford to basically give that kind of money away .
is there a way or a limit on how much it is .
whether it should be half a million dollars or five million dollars or whatever .
should there be a limit to what we are providing as a subsidy .
that twenty percent amounts to a substantial amount of money .
i &apos;m just wondering if it is necessary and if we can afford to give this money away .
chairperson :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you , mr. chairperson .
the business incentive policy already provided twenty percent but what we have done is we reclassify how that twenty percent will be applied .
so we have been working under twenty percent incentive all throughout what we have been doing .
re-profiling how that will be applied .
so we won &apos;t be paying any more or not much more than what we have paid already under contracts that we issue as a government .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
thank you .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i am not saying that whether we are paying more or whatever , but if there was a cap or a ceiling looked at other than the 20 % on the large contracts .
was that looked at and if not , is there a rationale as to why you feel that something , if that is something that we can afford to do .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you mr. chairman .
i am not sure whether capping contracts was reviewed .
so for services there is no real limit because they provide employment to the people of nunavut .
so that is where the cap applies .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i would like to ask the premier , i realize that this document was developed with nti &apos;s involvement .
if he could indicate whether there were any of those areas .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
premier .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you mr. chairman .
there were negotiations like on anything , and an agreement was reached and i had a joint press conference with mr. quassa the president of nti so they are on side with this policy .

i have now chosen the members for the income support policy review .
the selection process was based on letters of interest or resumes submitted by candidates .
i want to especially thank the members for participating in the gathering of candidates for consideration .
after reviewing over forty applicants , i am pleased to have appointed the following persons to conduct the income support policy review :
david arnatsiaq of igloolik , frank ipakohak of kugluktuk and joan scottie of baker lake .
these people will lead the consultation in the communities and report to me what the residents of nunavut want from the income support program .

new anglican ministers and help line celebration
hon. ed picco :
mr. speaker this past weekend two special events occurred here in iqaluit and i would like to tell the house about these events .
mr. speaker two long time iqaluit residents became fully ordained members of the anglican church .
the anglican cathedral was over flowing as bishop chris williams accompanied by our resident bishop paul idlout performed a service of ordination .
mr. speaker mike and methuselah are well known in iqaluit for their selfless dedication .
iqalummiut are justifiably proud of their achievement .
mr. speaker the help line was founded 10 years ago by iqaluit volunteers to help us deal with the issue of suicide .
at first it was called the baffin crisis line and that name has know evolved to the nunavut help line .
mr. speaker the keynote speaker at the banquet was a help line volunteer .
that person mr. speaker was our own jack anawak .
the honourable jack anawak spoke with compassion and concern and delivered a fine speech on behalf of the crisis line .
nunavut catering and owner doug lem and corporate sponsor first air deserve special recognition for their outstanding contribution to the line .
on a personal note mr. speaker i would like to thank the crisis line for being there for our family when we needed it .
i would also ask mr. speaker that this house join me in congratulating the nunavut help line and the reverend mike ferris and the reverend methuselah kunuk for their achievements .

chesterfield inlet residential school
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to make a member &apos;s statement on an issue that i &apos;m sure a lot of people have been touched by .
a lot of inuit have gone through the chesterfield inlet residential school as the residential school was open for a long time .
we were taught in english and we were not allowed to speak inuktitut at all .
i know that a lot of nunavut leaders went to that school and got a very good education .
we appreciate the fact we were taught very well in that school in chesterfield inlet .
however , there are a lot of people who attended the residential school who have a lot of personal problems and they have had emotional problems as well .
although the chesterfield inlet residential school is closed today , a lot of people are having a lot of problems because they were greatly affected by the experience .
having to go through a lot of changes within a short period of time .
there was a lot of abuse whether it was physical or emotional .
we had a hard time adapting to the qallunaq way of life .
although a lot of people have been trying to get some healing done there has been a lot of difficulty along with them and their families .
although there are some people that say they don &apos;t feel anything we can see they are hurting inside and i just wanted to talk about this situation too .

family well - being
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to make a member &apos;s statement today mr. speaker .
during this past month it has been a very difficult one for us listening to the news reports about suicides and family difficulties .
although i had made an earlier statement regarding these problems i would like to bring it up again , during this session . we all are often affected by people who commit suicide .
these things that do occur really affect me personally . i &apos;m sure a lot of people are affected by these suicides .
whenever i have a chance to talk about it and deal with it i would like to be given the opportunity to do so .
i want to encourage the people of nunavut to consider this seriously and be more open about it so we can discuss problems .
i just wanted to talk about this today .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you member .
the member is seeking unanimous consent to conclude his statements .
are there any nays .
there are no nays you can finish your statement .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
yes the problem that we have with suicides is something difficult to deal with .
we have been trying to work on this problem for a number of years , beginning in 1984 .
particularly in my community there are some groups that have been trying to deal with it .
also , there have been a lot of public hearings regarding this and people have been going to training programs to deal with suicide intervention and prevention .
how ever we have not come up with any solutions to deal with this directly .
there are a lot of people who still commit suicide within our community .
perhaps every month we have been hearing about a suicide in some communities .
we as members of the legislative assembly have to work hard and to try and give more support to those people who are working suicide prevention and intervention .
although we can come up with all kinds of ideas we still do not know how to deal with this in a constructive way .
we have also had a funding problem .
even if we say to our children that we love them i think it is a good start in supporting them , morally and emotionally .
or even if we sit down together as a family for a meal perhaps if we can give a prayer of thanks then it would help in any way for our children .
if we are more open to our children and we can talk to them i think that is a very good start in our homes .
their family members have also committed suicide .
i would be willing to talk more openly in the future .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
yes i recognize where you are coming from .
we hope that in the future this problem can be resolved .

air links to sanikiluaq
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker i want to speak about a particular concern that i have .
last year we had stated when the nunavut government first came into place that it would be more accessible to the people of nunavut .
the concern that i have is the routing of airlines .
i think they should more accessible to the communities of nunavut . particularly in my riding .
i have had a lot of problems trying to get to iqaluit from sanikiluaq .
of course this has been a problem for some time in my riding .
when we had a meeting in hall beach for the baffin leaders summit , the mayor of sanikiluaq came to me to make a presentation about this airline scheduling problems .
this has been a problem for some time for sanikiluaq residents particularly for unilingual people who have to attend meetings because they have to go via montreal and take the southern routes .
this has been complained about by the sanikiluaq residents so i am making the same complaint about it .

i believe we can have a close working relationship with the communities and the government of the nunavut .
we will not always meet the needs of the people but i believe we should have a close working relationship with the communities .
we should close the gap between the elders and the youth . if we start working on the elders and the youth it will alleviate the problems with suicide .

municipal financing and legislation review
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is directed to the minister of community government .
in the budget it stated ( interpretation ends ) that 150 thousand will be allocated this year for the review of municipal financing and municipal legislation .
mr. speaker , is the minister aware that a review of nunavut &apos;s municipal legislation just 15 months ago by the gnwt and the northwest territories association of municipalities .
the report of the review committee has been made public and was presented to the minister in december 1998 .
my question to the minister is why is it necessary to take another 150 thousand to study this point .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. akesuk .
minister of community government , mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
we have to review all the nunavut municipal government legislation to be able to review all the funding that is allocated for each community .
if we are going to be working more efficiently we are going to have to review the nunavut municipal legislation .
if we have to give them more funding then we will try to do that .
we have also noticed that there are some differences in some communities when it comes to municipal legislation .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :

it is very likely that the northern most communities are going to be left out again .
i hope that all the information at least will be given to the hamlet councils and to the appropriate agencies .
i don &apos;t know if that was clear mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :

we will be writing to all the nunavut communities .
we are not only going to be directing the letters to the hamlets but we will be utilizing other agencies and providing them with the contact numbers .
i do know where the member is coming from but there are differences in communities .
we have contracts with some social services and some are being handled by the government departments .
because of that we are going to try and get in touch with each of the communities .

department of education o &amp; m budget
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question is for the minister of finance .
i would like to ask the minister about his budget address .
under the area of education it indicated a number of areas of additional funding being allocated .
one is to provide additional inuktitut and inuinnaqtun curriculum .
two for investing in additional teachers and the third area was in the area of income support of 1.5 million .
mr. speaker , these three areas that the minister mentioned total about 3.1 million dollars , mr. speaker .
i would like to ask if this is additional dollars that is going to be coming in from elsewhere .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of finance , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , in the budget address there are a number of initiatives that are outlined .
some is new funding as a result of utilisation of some of the expected surplus funds .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister ng .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , as i indicated in my first question , i believe the increase in the o &amp; m budget for education is only 543 thousand .

thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of finance , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
there is an extensive review and discussions on each of those initiatives and on departmental spending .
we try to relate that to the government priorities from the bathurst mandate and from the budget consultation process that took place , and then the targets are set .
but as far as specifics on indexing or forced growth issues , again , it would be based on the merits of each proposal that came forward from each department , mr. speaker .

question 289 - 1 ( 3 ) :
income support review locations
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my first question will be directed toward the minister responsible for income support .
some of the question was brought up by the member from pond inlet , he mentioned some communities are going to be visited , like igloolik , baker lake and so on .
but these are not the highest , most expensive communities .
why do you not go to the high arctic communities because they are very expensive for food and clothing .
i would like to suggest that you visit the high arctic communities .
you have identified communities where it is a lot cheaper for the cost of living .
it &apos;s going to create an unrealistic picture if we visit just the communities where the cost of living is not that high .
i think mr. minister that i would like to ask you to include also the high arctic communities .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :

question 290 - 1 ( 3 ) :
community government and transportation budget
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to direct my question to the minister of community government and transportation .
in the budget estimates , there has been a lot less money allocated because of course the communities are growing very rapidly and there are going to be more programs and services required .
there was originally 80 million and 81 million and now in the year 2000 / 2001 there is only 78 million dollars in there now and i think that is quite scary .
is it possible to make some adjustments to reflect the growing communities and to reflect the growing expenditures for programs and services .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister responsible for community government and transportation , mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
when we were tallying up the budget figures we had members &apos; statements saying that we want to go in a new direction with the nunavut government and also with the bathurst mandate .
we had agreed that education , housing would be priorities of this government .
i believe we also agreed that housing and education are very much a priority .
of course we have to make a budget proposal that would reflect these priorities .
we are not going to be making any changes to the o &amp; m but like i said and the member stated there are some communities that will get decentralized positions .
this will give them growth and there is no money made available in the budget .

mr. speaker , i wish i had all the information for every department , but i don &apos;t .
that will be when each department comes before the committee of the whole , they will have more detailed information .
i can say that there is 1 million dollars , approximately 1 million dollars for the 2000 / 2001 year .
whether or not there is more funding i don &apos;t have the full substantiation for that project , but i am sure that the minister and her officials will have that information .

fire insurance coverage for school
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question is again for the minister of finance .
in his budget address the one table that i referred to last week was table 4 on capital expenditures .
i would like to ask the minister of finance if that money for that particular project as he had indicated it was burned by fire , if that has been covered off by insurance .

minister of finance in nunavut , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
we look collectively as a whole all of the governments &apos; fiscal performance .
as i indicated earlier and then in the budget speech , the fact that we have a bit of a surplus estimated for the 1999 / 2000 year is taken into consideration .
then you base your setting of departmental expenditures based on that mr. speaker .
thank you .

item 6 , oral questions .
member for akulliq , mr. alakannuark .
question 293 - 1 ( 3 ) :
decentralization to smaller communities
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
perhaps i could direct this question to the premier in regards to decentralization .
my question is have you considered the smaller communities in nunavut for decentralization .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
yes , although we have discussed this with our colleagues , we are not going to have any decentralization for the smaller communities but we are looking for ways to benefit them .
i know that the department of sustainable development have been working on ways they can help the smaller communities get more job opportunities .
although we won &apos;t be transferring any positions or offices to these communities , we are looking for ways to help and assist them in any way we can .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
member for akulliq riding , mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
when , in what year will you consider the smaller communities .
the reason i am asking this question is because i have two smaller communities in my riding and there is no decentralization for these two communities .
in what year will you start considering assisting the smaller communities .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
yes , i would like to ask the member , in your constituency community of repulse bay , i visited that community and they want to establish a park in that area .
as i have stated before i would like to find ways to support repulse bay when they are looking for an office facility and i would like to meet with the community too .
so in any way we can we will try and support the smaller communities , with job creation .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
going back to the orders of the day , oral questions .
member for uqqumiut , mr. iqaqrialu .
question 294 - 1 ( 3 ) :
budget process to reflect nunavut
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i will direct my question to the premier .
i don &apos;t know if we have followed our own procedures .
as the nunavut government we had inherited legislation and statutes from outside of our jurisdiction which i am not happy about .
i was wondering if we could amend our statutes and legislation to reflect the requirements and the needs of nunavummiut .
i think we should be utilizing the requirements and the needs of nunavut when we are amending legislation and preparing for the main estimates .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. premier . deputy premier , perhaps you would like to respond , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i think that would be appropriate given that it &apos;s a fiscal question i believe on the government priorities and how it has impacted on the main estimates .
i believe that was the question from the honourable member .
again , i would say that no , we have not overnight dramatically reformed or eliminated or changed our existing programs or services .
we will be having some further extensive debate on them over the weeks to come , mr. speaker .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you deputy premier .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
just a couple of days ago there was a budget address and today they have been tabled .
for that reason , when that happens we are going to be rushing around and we will lack time and opportunities to ask questions in regards to our concerns .
i was wondering if you could reconsider this process , i would be very happy .
also if you can give the regular members more opportunity to review the main estimates .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister of finance , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i would like to thank the member for clarifying his question .
so , this budget process was a bit prolonged that way , or delayed that way in getting all the information put together .
at the same time we would be putting together the estimates during this coming fall for the 2001 / 2002 operating year budgets , mr. speaker .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister of finance and deputy premier .
going back to the orders of the day .
oral questions .
member for baker lake , mr. mclean .
question 295 - 1 ( 3 ) :
nunavut transportation strategy
mr. mclean :
thank you , mr. speaker .
with the recent signing of the mou between manitoba and nunavut and today &apos;s statement from the minister of transportation regarding a transportation strategy or study for nunavut .
has the minister established a working group yet between nunavut and manitoba in regards to this transportation strategy .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. mclean .
minister of transportation and community government , mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak :
thank you , mr. speaker .
no the work at this point is strictly within the department but the deputy minister will be in contact with the government of manitoba to set up that working relationship .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister anawak .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
my apologies i didn &apos;t have my microphone on .
would the minister let me know , the members know if there are going to be any kinds of terms of reference and when we can see these .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. mclean .
minister anawak .
hon. jack anawak :
yes , mr. speaker , we can do that .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister anawak .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you , mr. speaker .
would the minister also inform me as a mla for the kivalliq , who is going to be involved in this strategy .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. mclean .
minister anawak .
hon. jack anawak :
i am sorry , i am getting ahead of myself here .

thank you mr. minister .
going back to the orders of the day , oral questions .
member for arviat , mr. o &apos;brien .
question 296 - 1 ( 3 ) :
criteria for school construction
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question today is to the minister responsible for education .
mr. speaker , my questions today are just of a general nature and i will follow them up with more detailed questions through the week .
my first question to the minister is what criteria has the minister used in the capital selections of capital projects for schools that were selected for the upcoming year .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you , mr. speaker .
we used the same criteria as we used last year .
those are safety and health issues .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister of education .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
mr. speaker , i believe so , because we rely on the information from the divisional boards of the different three regions .
they do our fieldwork .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister .
member for arviat , mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you , mr. speaker .
after that point the school i believe was delayed for a year and the project actually fell off the books and i think fell off the end of the world .
at this point in time it is my understanding that there is not even a file or a record to indicate that there was a need for school improvements in my community .
we expect for example over the next five years , that on the average of 70 - 80 children will be entering the school program .
so again , i say to the minister , in my case , if the minister could endeavour to find out whether or not the needs for my community were looked in to .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you , mr. speaker .
there is no way that the department can approve or reject the missing documents or the missing plans from the five year capital plans .
we looked for it everywhere even trying to find it from yellowknife on behalf of arviat .
i know what the condition of the playground is and i will be willing to work with member later .
if they are enough surplus dollars from the dissolution of the divisional boards perhaps that could be used for minor capital .
but , i &apos;m not in the position to make a commitment right now before we &apos;ve had a chance to talk to the department of public works .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i believe the playground issue is a minor component to the overall problem of over crowding of schools .
i realise that the minster is trying to deal with the issue and there are so many dollars to go around .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
even without the document the member is talking about . we can start , i already promised that we will start looking with the 20 year plans for all the schools in nunavut .
and , i also got a letter from the arviat &apos;s dea chairman , robert leonard , talking about the problems of overcrowding of the schools and i have the numbers here .
i &apos;m not disagreeing with the member .
it &apos;s just that last year and this year &apos;s criteria have been for safety issues in all the schools .
unfortunately , we are not able to provide the necessary renovation and expansion of schools in every community that need them right now .
so we concentrated on the problem areas like the schools in baker lake and clyde river and pond inlet .
so , i certainly will be looking at all the schools for the 20 year plan and get back to the member .
at least work with the member and the arviat community along the same line as with the other communities that need them very badly .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister of education .
going back to our orders of the day .
item 6 oral questions .
member for hudson bay . mr. kattuk .
question 297 - 1 ( 3 ) :
francophone school
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question is to the minister of education .
during our last meeting in rankin inlet , we heard that here in iqaluit , the francophone association would be getting their new school in iqaluit .
i just wondered how many francophone students would be attending that particular school that will be built in iqaluit .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kattuk , minister of education mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , it &apos;s always difficult to estimate how many students will be entering schools .
it also differs from year to year .
you also have to consider the growing community .
i cannot estimate how many students will be entering the francophone school in iqaluit .
i think i would like to explain to the member that the federal government has contributed money to the tune of 5 million dollars in building of the school .
i think most of the funding will be coming from the federal government .
so , that &apos;s why we agreed to build a school .
and , i can take his question as notice and get back to the member tomorrow .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
the minister has taken this as notice and he will get back to the member tomorrow .
do you have other questions mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk you don &apos;t have a question .
going back to orders of the day .
oral questions , member for baffin south , mr. akesuk .
question 298 - 1 ( 3 ) :
kimmirut social worker
mr. akesuk :
thank you mr. speaker .
i don &apos;t want to sound like a broken record .
my question is for the minister of health and social services ... ( interpretation ) ... again for the people of kimmirut we still don &apos;t have a social worker .
we haven &apos;t had one for a very long time and the people are anxiously waiting to get this position in kimmirut .
i mentioned this at the beginning of the year and my question is how much longer are we going to wait .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. akesuk .
minister of health and social services , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
they have not been able to staff the position .
we did in response to the member &apos;s question in february in rankin inlet .
we had a person interviewed for that position .
that person was ready to take that position in kimmirut , and at the last minute declined the offer .
mr speaker , my understanding is that we have to go back out again to re-advertise that position to find a person to fill that position in kimmirut .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister , mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you for that information .
are we going to be waiting for a long time or are you going to be as expedient as possible .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. akesuk .
minister of health and social services , mr. picco .
hon ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker we are endeavouring to try and fill that position and the member knows and some of the members in the house through debate on the kimmirut social worker .
the first concern is the house . we didn &apos;t have any housing in kimmirut .
we secured a residence for the social worker .
we went back out to competition .
several people applied and we narrowed down to one person and finally when that person was offered the job , they backed out at the last moment .
we have gone out to competition , we still hold the house .
so , that we can fill the position , we &apos;ll have a residence available .
mr. speaker , it brings out a bigger question is that with the recruitment of social workers and last week i know in this house we had 5 from igloolik who are training .
we also have another 5 from igloolik who will be finished in may with their diploma in social work .
we hope we will be able to start filling these positions mr. speaker .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
going back to the orders of the day .
oral questions .
iqaluit centre mr. tootoo .
question 299 - 1 ( 3 ) :
status of 5 year plan
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker my question again is for the minister of finance .
in his budget address and another question he had alluded to the committing to the development of a 5-year plan .
i just like to ask the minister , who or where his staff are , who they &apos;re involving in this process .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of finance , mr. ng .
hon kelvin ng .
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker as you know the department of finance acts on behalf of government in trying to co-ordinate the provision of information and putting together the main estimates and the capital estimates .
and it is really each individual department responsible for the planning for their specific needs .
the plan would be to move on from there and try to resolve and produce a 5 year capital planning document that i spoke of at the budget address .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question to the same minister .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of finance , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i don &apos;t know if the municipalities would provide their own capital plans .
i don &apos;t see that would hopefully differ too much on what we heard during the budget consultation hearings that we undertook .
as you know they were quite extensive and there was significant participation from municipalities across nunavut during each community &apos;s hearings .
so , we &apos;re hoping that a lot of that is consistent and certainly also consistent to what the members bring forward on behalf of their constituents as well thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
we are on item 6 .
oral questions .
did anybody else want to make another comment .
member for baker lake , mr. mclean .
question 300 - 1 ( 3 ) :
standards and criteria for community halls
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question today uqaqti , the community hall in baker lake was built in 1986 when our population was quite small .
and it &apos;s increased quite a bit .
at this point , we &apos;re to the point where we can &apos;t have a full function , celebration in the community hall at this time .
i know there has been expansion of community halls around the region now .
can the minister responsible explain to me if standards and criteria &apos;s are changing for the size of community halls in each community .
thank you mr. speaker .
hon jack anawak : ( interpretation ) :
mr. speaker i believe your microphone is off .
( interpretation ends ) at this point , we haven &apos;t changed the policy on the size of the community and the community hall or the building we build in communities .
but , i can assure the member that we will be looking at all the community halls .
but , we will look at all the communities , in terms of the sizes .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
the time allotted for question period is over . we will take a fifteen minute break .
&gt; &gt; house recessed for fifteen minutes .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
the house will come back to order .
item 8 returns to written questions .
mr. picco .
item 8 :
returns to written questions
return to wq 04 - 1 ( 3 ) :
rankin inlet birthing centre
hon. ed picco :
mr. speaker i have two returns .
the first one to a question asked by mr. mclean on the rankin inlet birthing centre . there were one hundred and seventy-three births at the birthing centre since 1993 .
question 2 - was it well received and accepted ?
the following information was extracted form the evaluation of the birthing project in rankin inlet , northwest territories , 1996 .
the principal investigator , mr. speaker , was marie chamberlain .
from the community members receiving care one of the patients receiving care gave the following quote &quot; choice had increased significantly for a place of delivery . &quot;
many women stated they would like to be cared by inuit midwives .
&gt; &gt; applause
all felt that training inuit midwives was important and the expertise of the elder who knew about birthing traditions should be a part of the training .
mr. speaker in the budget coming up for the department of health i &apos;m hoping to elaborate on some exciting things that we are hoping to do , using inuit elders and traditional medicine .
question 3 mr. speaker .
the health benefits of this project cannot be measured in financial terms for this short-term study .
this analysis has not been conducted .
this is helping alleviate that .
question 4 for mr. mclean was - does the minister see it continuing in the future ?
the birthing centre became an accepted program in 1995 after a 2 year pilot project phase .
it will indeed continue as a program in the future and plans are currently underway to expand the service to clients in other keewatin communities .
&gt; &gt; applause
the medical criteria must be met firstly , which is low risk patients .
we also wish to provide support to nurses in the keewatin communities who are caring for clients with the maternal and infant program .
return to wq 09 - 1 ( 3 ) :
health &amp; social services funding programs
thank you , mr. speaker and i would like to give my second return to an oral question .
mr. speaker , my second return is to an oral question asked by the honourable david iqaqrialu .
it was asked on february 28 , 2000 .
the question was in regards to the community based funding programs and the application processes .
those are brighter futures , building healthy communities , the canada prenatal nutrition program ( cpnp ) and the national native alcohol and drug addiction program ( nnadap ) .
mr. speaker those are brighter futures , building healthy communities , cpnp and nnadap , which all use canada health &apos;s formula funding program to deliver program dollars to our region .
brighter futures and building healthy communities use this same formula mr. speaker to allocate funds to communities .
continuing with mr. iqaqrialu &apos;s questions .
number 3 - what were the funding allocations made for each nunavut community at the beginning of each of the past two years and the current year for each such program .
mr. speaker i have provided in my return an attachment that lists every nunavut community and the monies that are coming forth but i won &apos;t read that for the record .
but it is available for the members and the other members .
guidelines and communications within the communities were made to each hamlet in nunavut outlining the proposal procedures and indeed mr. speaker the application process .
mr speaker the applications are available in inuktitut as provided by the gnwt .
nunavut health and social services is developing a multi-lingual document for 2000 / 2001 .
so it has been a multi- departmental initiative .
mr. speaker number 6 question asked by mr. iqaqrialu was - how many communities submitted applications for these funding programs but did not receive funding .
mr. speaker that is an excellent question .
how many communities had asked for money and didn &apos;t receive any ?
the short answer to that question mr. speaker is none .
every community that asked for money got money mr. speaker .
for each funding program which communities did not submit applications .
for brighter futures and building healthy communities all communities , twenty-six participated .
cnpn funds were accessed based upon need and the capacity .
mr. speaker this will not be ascertained until all communities report and that report is due on april 15 , 2000 .
mr speaker the final question asked by mr. iqaqrialu - how much funding was given out under each of the following programs , in this department , for each community in nunavut .
mr. speaker i would ask mr. iqaqrialu and the members of the house to refer to the attachment connected with the written question .
thank you , mr. speaker for allowing me the opportunity to respond to these two excellent written questions .

thank you mr. premier .
mr. iqaqrialu .

at this point , i have to recognize a person from manitoba , mark christen .
welcome to the assembly .
mr. premier , if you didn &apos;t forget the questions that were being brought forth to you .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank mr. chairperson .
up to date we didn &apos;t have a concrete policy in place according to agreements that we made .
we don &apos;t know as of yet how this policy will be used in nunavut .
there are some provisions in there that have been used previously .
however , nti said they would be looking into this matter as well and consult with business owners in the nunavut area .
we have to consult with those people to see what kind of problems they have come across in regards to this policy .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
thank you for the clarification .
i see that this policy will be of good use to business owners in nunavut .
my other question was in relation to contracts that have been awarded to some business owners , however , they have to fill out forms in order to comply with this act or regulations .
when that is the case according to the nunavut policy , there are some inuit business owners that have to fill out all kinds of forms .
i &apos;m just wondering if these forms they have to fill out will be translated into inuktitut along with all the regulations within the policy .
if you can understand me .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
up to today , we have been using the policy and we &apos;re trying to get it translated into inuktitut .
it has been televised and reported on the radio in inuktitut .
so , the inuktitut translation is now available .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. premier or mr. mrazek .
mr. mrazek :
thank you mr. chairman .
i would like respond to the question from the mla , that the forms will be translated and procedure manual will be translated .
so this is going to be a little bit easier than with the previous business incentive policy .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
yes , i welcome that inuktitut translation .
we &apos;ll be more appropriate for inuktitut speaking business owners and they are going to be able to read all the forms in inuktitut , and speak in inuktitut as well .
but i would like to ask the premier , if the staff can communicate in inuktitut to business owners .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
which one of you is going to answer the question .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
i cannot answer his question at this time .
our assistant deputy minister will be an inuktitut speaking person .
so , i think he or she can look into this further .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
yes , i &apos;m glad that you will be preparing for this .
especially when it comes to the business incentive policy for inuktitut speaking business owners .
i think this is very good news for them because there &apos;s been a lot of business owners that have come across problems with the previous policy .
i &apos;m sure this has been brought up to but i would like to ask another question on that .
in the communities , whether they are bigger centres or smaller centres , there &apos;s been some people getting into their own businesses and trying to operate businesses efficiently .
i &apos;m just wondering if they &apos;ll be utilizing the local business owners as much as possible .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i cannot state at this time whether we will be fully utilizing the inuit business owners in local communities , but we have put out this policy so people will get into more businesses .
we would give them an incentive where we would add 10 percent if it were inuit owned but we haven &apos;t made anything definite on the smaller communities .
there is the nunavut firm status adjustment of 14 and 3 percent inuk firm and local status at present .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i don &apos;t want to be the only one asking questions because i &apos;m sure there are going to be other people who want to ask other questions .
one of the clarifications that i would like is in regards to the businesses .
it states in there that they would get a 20 percent bid adjustment on contracts .
with the previous government , and when they were awarding contracts , they were put up to 40 percent with the previous government .
so , there &apos;s quite a change if we put it at 20 percent .
is that going to have an effect on the people who are bidding for contracts .
thank you mr. mr. chairperson .
chairperson :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i don &apos;t know where you got that 40 percent from because i &apos;ve never heard about it . it used to be in the 20 percent area with the business incentive policy .
we &apos;ll use 20 percent because of course if it &apos;s any higher , it &apos;s going to be too expensive .
we &apos;ll leave it around the 20 percent area and this is for all of nunavut .
it doesn &apos;t define where this 20 percent is going to be adjusted but we did include that there would be incentives for inuit owned businesses to help the community businesses .
thank you mr. mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
also , i would like to ask about getting contracts where you would try and get the lowest bidder .
with that included in the policy , the larger businesses are the ones who can try and get the lowest bid .
but , of course you know it &apos;s very expensive to operate a business up here in nunavut .
is it possible to make that change .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
this proposed policy is for the benefit the people of nunavut and businesses .
because of that we give 20 percent for people of nunavut to make that adjustment .
so the nunavut businesses have just as much opportunity as the larger businesses .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i &apos;m starting to smile more about owning a business in nunavut .
it also talks here about hamlets , they do not own businesses .
usually the hamlets don &apos;t own businesses .
it also states here that this would go through the hamlets .
is that the case mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
everyone who uses government money , including the hamlets councils , if they are funded by the government by more than 51 percent they will have to comply with our policies .
again we have stated that should there be any concerns we are open to any suggestions sometime in the future .
what we &apos;re trying to do here is let the nunavut businesses benefit from this policy .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
a very clear response .
the hamlets are local government and they have to treat people fairly and equally just like the nunavut government .
if that &apos;s the case then is it not possible for the hamlets to be financially benefiting and pushing out the local businesses .
is that going to be reviewed again by your staff .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
this policy is for nunavut businesses .
it is not for the hamlet councils .
if the local businesses would like to sign a contract with the hamlet council then they would have to comply with this policy .
if there should be a problem we will review this nni policy again .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
yes , that &apos;s it at this point .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i &apos;d like to ask maybe the premier and staff .
were there any particular concerns like the chamber of commerce had on the policy .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you mr. chairperson .
numerous concerns leading up to the production of the policy were heard and addressed through the policy .
in the initial draft , there were concerns over the grandfather clause .
we dealt with that over a transitional period under section 20 of the policy .
there were concerns with the different departments doing different things in accordance with the policy .
like the criteria , the standardised criteria .
we dealt with it through section 11 , through an evaluation process and the bid adjustment process .
there were concerns about the appeal process .
in the past , there were no appeals .
so , we addressed that by setting up an appeals process under section 18 of the policy .
there were concerns about the monitoring and enforcement under the old bip policy .
we addressed that through section 14 and 15 by setting up a monitoring and enforcement process .
there were concerns there were no real employment and training benefits under the old policy .
we addressed that with bonuses under section 12 , under bonuses and penalties under the new policy .
there were concerns for incentives for hiring inuit for example .
we addressed that again through section 12 , through bonuses and penalties in the new policy .
there were concerns raised about previous companies being covered under the policy when they weren &apos;t entitled to be .
we addressed those under section 14 and 15 by monitoring the enforcement of the policy .
there were concerns about inuit companies receiving extra incentives under the old policy , we addressed that through section 11 through the evaluation process and bid adjustment process .
so , there were numerous concerns raised and we addressed them through the policy and really appreciate the comments we received from all concerned .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairperson , i understand there are also representatives from nti .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you mr. chairman .
there were representatives of the development corporations on the working group , so i imagine their concerns were addressed in the working group .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , last week i was asking the premier as far as having a limit or a cap on the subsidies provided .
i am just wondering if , specifically on a construction contract if there would be a limit on that .
i am just wondering if that &apos;s been addressed .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you mr. chairman .
as i stated in my prior answers , we set up a cap for goods at 100 thousand dollars .
so if it is a major construction project and the goods are pretty expensive then they will be capped at 100 thousand dollars .
so that is the cap on where it won &apos;t produce much employment for the residents of nunavut for getting goods .
it is capped at 100 thousand dollars .
we want to create employment in the territory , and that &apos;s one of the main focuses of the policy .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , in section 12 under bonuses and penalties , the first one says that contracts may provide for , and then it goes on to list the different bonuses .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you mr. chairman .
perhaps i can go from the changes that were made from the draft that you were provided .
okay under section 12 for example , 12.2 used the word may on the first sentence , penalties may apply .
that has been changed to shall .
if you go to the next section , section 12.3 , on the first sentence , bonus or penalty may has been changed to shall .
on the next section also where it is referring to may , has been changed to shall .
on 12.5 second line , may has been changed to shall . 12.6 also the first line , may has been changed to shall .
if you go to 12.7 as well the may has been changed to shall , so there is less discretion in the policy .
does that clarify the question .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i would like to thank the premier for those changes .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr cornthwaite would you like to respond .
mr. cornthwaite :
thank you mr. chairman .
the government has to have the ultimate power to decide with regard to the incentives .
hope that answers your question .
chairperson ( interpretation ) : thank you .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
so i guess , just to make that point clear is how this is going to be implemented is basically at the discretion of the department responsible for doing that .
that &apos;s all i have for right now i will let somebody else have some questions .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
are one of you are going to be responding to that question .
no .
okay , other questions .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i don &apos;t believe it is part of this policy but it does have an effect .
the private businesses have a plan or put a business plan together when they are going to be trying to obtain some contracts .
usually they hire lawyers to put the draft together , the agreement and the structure and so on .
lawyers don &apos;t come cheap .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
it doesn &apos;t have anything to do with the nni policy .
this is more to help the businesses if they want to establish their own private businesses then possibly what they can do is use the department of sustainable development .
it has nothing to do with this so i can &apos;t give you an adequate response .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i wouldn &apos;t say anything about it if it had nothing to do with this policy , but of course there are going to be businesses that will be established .
once you establish a business you have to use this policy .
this is going to be a very important policy for us as the nunavut government and we will have to use nunavut local businesses .
it has everything to do with the businesses that we are planning to establish .
so i would suggest that the department of sustainable development work very hard on this issue and i can help them and give them advice .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i don &apos;t hear a question .
just a comment .
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
is there going to be training made available for these small businesses .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
we are already starting the training process .
they are going out to the communities and we hope to cover all the nunavut communities in this year .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
since there is going to be support for the smaller businesses are you also going to be considering the other communities so that everybody will have a fair chance at obtaining these government contracts .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. akesuk .
mr. premier or ... mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
yes if they are from nunavut , they will get support . there is a 3 percent local bid adjustment for businesses with local status .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
the smaller businesses that are just getting established don &apos;t have the required equipment or they don &apos;t have vehicles .
for those that are just starting out .
there are some businesses that have all their equipment and there are some that are just getting established and have hardly any resources .
are you going to be giving some support to those businesses that are just getting established .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. premier .
manitok . i am sorry , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
just call me manitok , it &apos;s okay .
i have got a very expensive name .
also we try and make sure that they contracts are put in the hamlet offices and in the newspapers .
my department and sustainable development &apos;s mandates are a little bit different .
the department of sustainable development is more to help the establishment of small businesses and with my department we deal solely with the contracts .
but we will take your issues into consideration and we will see how we can have a better working relationship on this issue with dsd .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
anybody else .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i couldn &apos;t find the button for my microphone .
in the nni policy on section 9.0 the clyde river protocol .
could you clarify that for me because it says the clyde river protocol , the only community mentioned is clyde river .
it is the only community mentioned , so what is so special about it .
thank you .
chairperson :
premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
yes , that just tries to elaborate the agreement that took place in clyde river between nunavut tunngavik incorporated and that agreement was called the clyde river protocol .
so we used that clyde river protocol and that was only one of the protocols that we have used when preparing for this policy .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
but is there a clyde river protocol .
did you just use clyde river as a name .
could you clarify that again to me please .
chairperson :
premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
so therefore we had signed that agreement here in iqaluit , and even though we did that , the agreement was called the clyde river protocol .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
mr. nutarak do you have any further comments or questions .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
i don &apos;t mind using that name .
the premier had stated that the policy would take effect on april 1st , and i know it will be implemented .
if we don &apos;t implement it i am sure there will be some problems that arise from it , if it doesn &apos;t go ahead .
as we have stated that housing shortage is in crisis now and we would like to see the units constructed this year and it is one of the nunavut government &apos;s highest priorities .
i know that the construction of housing will have to be tendered out this spring , if the nunavut government brings some process in on that agreement .
so i just wanted to find out what kind of consequences there would be if we do not pass this policy .
so i have those two questions .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
mr. premier , if you or one of your officials would like to respond to that question .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
yes , this will take effect on april 1st , and as the government we have the authority to regulate the policies and to implement them .
if any one of my colleagues had any concerns we are now collecting concerns so that we can amend the nni .
so once we are using this policy it is going to benefit the communities .
so therefore we want to implement this on april 1st , that &apos;s why .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier for giving us the opportunity to make amendments once we find out what kind of problems are occurring .
since this is new we will implement it and once it come into effect we will know from experience what kind of problems will occur .
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
in regards to mr. iqaqrialu &apos;s question , i don &apos;t think they answered him properly .
will the contract procedures be in inuktitut .
for example if they want to build a water reservoir in my community , and that is tendered out , the contracting documents are about this thick .
a lot of reading is required .
will these documents be translated into inuktitut .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
mr. premier , if you or any of your officials would like to respond .
mr. mrazek :
thank you mr. chairman .
that is a very interesting proposal .
but we are not involving ourselves with pre-tendering or anything like this at that point , you have to realize that from the contracting law it is basically not permitted .
i am not sure if i answered your question , but i thought i would try .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. mrazek .
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
i apologize , i almost spoke as if i was the chairperson .
so in regards to mr. iqaqrialu &apos;s question that is how i understood it .
that &apos;s why i just rephrased the question and asked the same question again .
i will be asking a question in regards to that question again .
my second question .
i know that in most of the smaller communities , small businesses are being established .
you either require the worker &apos; s compensation board .
there are many requirements in the contracts that hinder small inuit businesses from applying for the contracts .
for example if i wanted to bid for the one hundred thousand dollar contract , i would have to pay a percentage of that .
we would need bid security at all times .
even for the small businesses how can we give more forms of help for inuit businesses that are establishing .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
mr. premier or your staff , if you would like to respond .
mr. mrazek :
mr. chairman the current situation regarding the bid security which is required by the law is still 100 thousand plus .
for the last number of years in some contracts we were able to eliminate the bid security specifically dealing with the hamlets and the risk was absolutely minimal .
so that leads us to believe that increasing the bid security to a quarter of a million dollars is probably the right thing to do .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you for your response .
do you have any further questions mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
so i understand the bid security will no longer be in use .
i don &apos;t think i understand your response .
are we going to do away with the bid security .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
yes , at this point if you are going to bid for a 100 thousand dollar contract you need a security deposit .
perhaps we need to increase the total number for bids up to a 250 thousand dollar contract .
a 100 thousand dollar contract doesn &apos;t require a security bid .
if the contract is 250 thousand dollars or more then you require a security bid .
i hope i responded to your question .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
my last question is more a comment than a question .
in most of the communities a majority of the businesses require assistance .
i myself experienced this .
they bypassed the smaller contractors , for example if they have to build an arena or to build a big housing facility .
the big housing companies don &apos;t want to hire local people for employment , they use transient workers .
like gc north wins contracts they can afford to bring all their equipment into the community and once they are done they ship it all out again .
all the benefits do not trickle down to the community , it only benefits the big company .
this has been the case in the past .
perhaps we should be saying that we are going to be utilising local businesses for construction purposes .
this way we will be able to help small businesses in the communities to develop .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq that was more of a comment than a question , but i &apos;m sure the premier would like to comment .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr chairperson .
i too have seen it that way when i worked at a local law firm .
the big companies bypassed us because we were northerners or inuit .
that &apos;s why i have pushed for this nunavummi nangminiqaqtunik ikajuuti , because once we utilise this policy it will become beneficial .
so i understand where you are coming from .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you premier .
are there any more comments .
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
mr chairperson i just noticed while going through the budget address that a very small amount of corporate income tax was collected in nunavut .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. premier if you want to respond to that .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you mr. chairman .
this policy did not focus on taxes .
we want to promote as much opportunity as possible for businesses in our territories .
so that is one of the reasons we have such a low corporate tax rate , probably one of the lowest in the country .
we want to promote more investment and opportunities for nunavummiut .
that &apos;s all i can say .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
mr. tootoo if you have any further comments .
mr. tootoo :
i guess i was just wondering if we could provide more of an incentive to corporations who do pay their taxes in nunavut .
looking at the numbers and how much money gets spent up here it is quite obvious that a lot of those corporations do work up here but are based somewhere else .
i was wondering if we could look at implementing some type of incentive for businesses that do file their income taxes in nunavut .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. premier or one of his officials can answer .
we are dealing with the nunavummi nangminiqaqtunik ikajuuti policy .
so if you want to elaborate more or one of your officials , go ahead .
hon. paul okalik :
the focus of the policy is to create incentives for businesses in nunavut .
if they are not based in nunavut then they won &apos;t be covered .
for those companies that are situated outside of the territory who were once covered under the old business incentive policy they have 2 years to fall into line .
thank you , mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. premier .
mr. tootoo go ahead .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
section 3 , under the authority which allows cabinet on an exceptional basis to depart from the application of the policy , mr. chairman a couple of questions .
why is that policy there and what are the types of situations that would warrant an exception .
i need some clarification there .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. mrazek .
mr. mrazek :
if you look at just about any policy there is always a clause for the authority to make an exception and override what is there .
so i think this is the reason the section is included .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i guess the deputy minister indicated it &apos;s there because it &apos;s always been there .
but what are the examples , if he has ever encountered any other than it has always been there .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. mrazek .
mr. mrazek :
thank you mr. chairman .
there is nothing hidden providing that a paragraph or statement is there , and i cannot give you an example or envision what could happen in the future .
it is there because every policy has the authority statement .
i would like to make sure that mr. tootoo understands that it has not been put into the policy for any particular reason .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr mrazek i just wanted to get some clarity for that .
section 11.1 and 11.2 of the policy outlines the detailed bid adjustment values for nunavut firms , inuit firms and local status firms , and inuit content criteria .
has the government calculated an approximate cost for implementing this policy based on those values .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik :
yes we have .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
would the premier be willing to let us know what those numbers might be .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
premier .
hon. paul okalik :
i don &apos;t have those numbers with me but they can be provided . the old policy was around an 8 percent adjustment .
this new one should be around 9 percent .
so about a percentage increase in government costs .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
i have another question mr. chairperson .
will this policy affect the p3 projects .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. mrazek .
mr. mrazek :
thank you mr. chairman .
the policy applies to all nunavut businesses regardless if it is a contract for construction , a grocery store or something like that .
so mr. tootoo is right it will apply to p3 project contracting procedures .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
if you can use the last names .
mr. tootoo do you have any other questions .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
section 11.5 allows the responsible department to develop evaluation criteria for specific professional service contracts .
i &apos;m just wondering what types of contracts are envisioned here .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. mrazek or premier , i don &apos;t know which of you wants to respond to the question .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you mr. chairman this policy covers every department in our government and any type of contract .
it could be for legal services or an engineering contract or it could be for a construction contract .
so , each department will address each contract for each case .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
so do you mean any consulting contracts also are covered by this and they would apparently just be put out and tendered as well .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik :
yes , this is the case .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman and thank you premier .
i really appreciate those types of answers .
under section 14 it directs that each contract authority will be responsible for monitoring and enforcing the policy .
what consequences will be in place for departments or officials that don &apos;t adequately apply the policy in their contracting .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik :
we will be the one enforcing the policy so it will be up to each department to decide what mechanism to use .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you premier .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
is there going to be some type of a monitoring or audit to make sure that the policy is being followed by that department .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
premier .
hon. paul okalik :
we have set up some mechanisms .
for example if a business is aggrieved then they can use the appeal process .
that can then expose non-compliance by a department . so , there are provisions nti and the government will be responsible for monitoring and enforcing the policy .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i see this as a very crucial area of the policy .
there needs to be a way of monitoring and enforcing the policy .
i know that in the previous government and i &apos;m not sure if it is still in practice in this government .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you mr. chairman .
as i said there is an appeal process that we have set up for any aggrieved person or a given contractor .
they can refer to a board and we looked at the possibility of setting up a centralised agency , but we also looked at the costs of doing that .
so for the time being we are relying on the aggrieved person filing an appeal to an appeal board .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i guess as the premier stated , unless the contractor knows to appeal , or decides to file a grievance there won &apos;t be any whether one is required or not .
as he also indicated it is up to us as the government and nti to monitor the policy .
it may be worthwhile maybe developing some type of a review system within an existing division of government accounting that may be there already .
that &apos;s just a suggestion .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
premier .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you mr. chairman .
we have set up a review process in the policy itself .
so the policy itself will be reviewed in due course .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
as a new government of course we would like to set up policies that are nunavut friendly or people friendly .
i would like to say that as inuit it is not our tradition to make money .
it is something that is new that has come about to the inuit .
i think it was around the beginning of the 70 &apos;s that we started looking at economic development and gaining financially .
i think that we as the nunavut government could be a new beginning for the people of nunavut and that we can be better prepared .
so with that in mind , i think that we should use past experiences to learn from it and be able to make changes to this policy so that it is a living document .
my question is then , are we going to be given the opportunity to work on it further .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you very much for that clarification .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
as it states here there will be an ongoing review process with this policy .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman , for those excellent responses .
i believe this was a question brought up by mr. irqittuq .
so i am asking the premier if we can start producing these documents with inuktitut translations available already and not use the old documents .
we might as well produce new documents that will come out in both english and inuktitut .
since we are a new government i am sure we can do that .
chairperson :
premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i can &apos;t respond to your question because of course there has to be work done first .
we could possibly do that some time in the future .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
that &apos;s it .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
one little piece of highlight i missed near the back of the document .
on section 18.9 it states that &quot; notwithstanding an appeal may be pending the contract authority may award the contract . &quot;
i just need some clarification there , does it mean that they could or they couldn &apos;t or how would one determine whether they do or not .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. cornthwaite .
mr. cornthwaite :
thank you mr. chairman .
hope that answers your question .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i was just wondering in that case what would be done .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. cornthwaite .
mr. cornthwaite :
thank you mr. chairman .
if they had a legitimate complaint .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
questions , comments .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
premier in reference to rfps , would this policy effect the rfps .
how do you plan on working them into the scenario .
secondly how will the policy be enforced or overseen in reference to the hamlets .
chairperson :
premier .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you mr. chairman .
rfps are covered under the policy .
under hamlets , community government will be the body that enforces these issues .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
premier could you be a little bit more precise in reference to how you see the policy interacting with the rfps .
chairperson :
premier .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you mr. chairman .
if you look at section 11.2 of the policy , there &apos;s a process in there for requests for proposals .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
he &apos;s doing some heavy reading there .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
i will finish reviewing this and get back to the premier with my other questions .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
any further comments .
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk :
thank you mr. chairman .
i believe that &apos;s it for the questions .
now that we are done with our questions on this issue in dealing with the nni , i would like to thank the premier for responding to our questions .
so i would like to move this aside and i would like to report progress .

resignation as speaker
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
it is with regret and sorrow that i make my member &apos;s statement today .
honourable members of the house are aware about the recent events of my personal life have put me in the position where i feel obliged to formally resign as speaker .
mr. speaker , i want to do what is best for the house and for the people we serve .
i can assure my constituents and the communities that i will continue to represent their interests and aspirations as a regular member of the assembly .
thank you mr. speaker .

youth drop-in centre for iqaluit
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr speaker i have had pleasure and the honour of representing iqaluit , now going on my 5th year .
over the years many things have been accomplished and there is much more to do .
mr. speaker to date the greatest disappointments as a mla continues to frustrate me .
alas the building we had secured fell through , all our planning fell by the way side .
we then struck another working group to review the issue and try and make some headway .
recreational activities and access to computers and the internet , etc .
many businesses in town were contacted and all were all supportive .
at one stage a local contractor drew a floor plan for us and we had volunteer labour to continue to work .
again the building availability fell through .
uqaqti today we have reformed a working group to continue the work of opening a dedicated youth drop in centre .
the largest stumbling block is to find a building or lot that would be large enough as well as be in a neighbourhood that would be conducive for our youth drop in centre .
in the meantime , a local business , the grind and brew offers a location for youth to meet .
the john howard group does also .
but , with the estimated youth population of over 1000 mr. speaker , a dedicated larger centre is needed .
there is some good news mr. speaker , i believe an opportunity now does present itself to move forward and bring successful completion to this file .
the arctic winter games host committee has recently moved forward on a proposal for a multi-purpose facility that will complement and enhance local infrastructure .
mr. speaker i have spoken to the chairperson of the host society and will be throwing my support behind this excellent initiative .
maybe now mr. speaker , the youth of iqaluit will finally have their own dedicated place .
mr. speaker , i will be attending the meeting tonight to endorse this proposal .

monica and thomas ugjuk
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
we hold great respect for our elders .
our elders have worked very hard even though many still live in hardship .
there is a couple in rankin inlet who i would like to honour today .
their names are monica and thomas ugjuk .
they have worked very hard all their lives .
mr. ugjuk , who is partially handicapped , still enjoys going out on the land hunting and fishing .
monica ugjuk is still very active even though she doesn &apos;t have many resources .
i would like to honour mr and mrs. ugjuk today of rankin inlet .
i believe there &apos;s a lot of people out there who also believe that they should be honoured .
i believe we don &apos;t give enough recognition to the elders .
we just see them and we have often missed out in honouring our elders when they are still alive .
they have contributed so much .
they could contribute even more with our support and i believe we should honour them while they are still able to help us with their wisdom .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak for those wise comments .

member &apos;s statement 217 - 1 ( 3 ) :
cape dorset figure skating club
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr speaker , i rise today to recognize the members of the cape dorset figure skating club that first started in 1995 .
i &apos;m not sure how to say it in inuktitut so i &apos;ll just say that they dance on the ice with their skates on .
many children wanted to participate in figure skating but due to the shortage and to the high price of skates , it was not possible for some families to participate .
the cape dorset figure skating club contacted the stephenville figure skating club and asked them to donate youth skates .
which they receive and in return they would receive inuit art that they use for fund raising for their club .
since that time they have become sister clubs and have exchanged approximately 60 skates , shirts and outfits .
( interpretation ends ) the two clubs talked about doing some travel together .
this dream became a reality in the fall of 1999 .
stephenville was in the process of opening a brand new arena .
the skaters from cape dorset were invited to perform the opening show .
they travelled march 8 to stephenville , newfoundland to perform in the grand opening of the stephenville dome that was scheduled for opening on saturday march 11 , 1999 .
proud parents oloosie workman , kanayuk salamonie , muati mathewsie and elisapie curley accompanied them .
mr. speaker i would like to ask for unanimous consent to complete my comments .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. akesuk .
the member for rankin south , ms. thompson .
i apologize i was moving on to another subject .
i thought mr. akesuk was done .
mr. akesuk would like unanimous consent from the members to complete his statement .
are there any nays .
since there is none go ahead mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
the opening skaters included 1998 olympic silver medallist brian orser , the 2000 canadian pair champions jamie shar and david pallister and the newfoundland pair team joshua and rebecca babe .
the cape dorset skaters had time to spend time with these skaters after the show to meet and get autographs and get their pictures taken with them .
( interpretation ) while in newfoundland the skaters were interviewed by cbc radio and received television coverage that was aired on cbcs here and now , north beat and newsworld .
and addition they were seen on the aboriginal peoples television network .
helena workman and joe saw salomonie presented a flag of nunavut and a sport nunavut flag at the opening ceremonies to mha kevin elwood .
josie taukie , taukie taukie , and kanayuk salomonie throat sang at the ceremonies .
the skaters from cape dorset nunavut stole the show and did nunavut proud .
mr. speaker i want to share this with all the members .
thank you mr. speaker .

iqaluit / nuuk arctic winter games
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
thank you mr. speaker today i would like to make a member &apos;s statement about the upcoming iqaluit / nuuk arctic winter games .
i have been told by the people of rankin inlet and some other people that attended the arctic winter games in whitehorse .
the next games are going to be in iqaluit and nuuk .
the people of nunavut realize that our athlete &apos;s from nunavut are not as accomplished as the other athletes that go to the arctic winter games are .
i think they should be practising a lot more just like the other athletes from other jurisdictions .
i was given this suggestion by robert tatty from rankin inlet that i would like to relay this to the house .
thank you mr. speaker .

member &apos;s statement 219 - 1 ( 3 ) :
change of nunavut day
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker i heard over the radio this morning about nunavut day being proposed to be changed .
the nunavut government started on april 1st .
i feel that april 1st is not as appropriate but july the 9th is .
the first monday in august was being proposed by some people .
i know that everybody realises that the first monday of august is a holiday and perhaps for the people that are working they don &apos;t want this changed .
everybody that is employed is more inclined to keep the august 1 holiday .
they go out hunting on holidays for the people that are working .
the hunters usually go out hunting because they are going out for food and they are out hunting for living .
i just wanted to make a statement about the august the first being a holiday and to give people the information as to the reason why we want to have nunavut day changed .

the year has gone by so fast it feels like weeks .

as we strive to make life a little better for all of nunavummiut .
as our new logo describes and means , look forward but look back .
today mr. speaker i would like to look back who had the vision to help build nunavut .

i would like to direct my question to the minister of health and social services .
there was an individual that was escorted down here and of course , when they stay in the community for a long time they tend to accumulate materials .
this person has accumulated quite a lot of materials .
my question is what kind of help could this person have financially if he or she would like to transport her stuff back home .

question 303 - 1 ( 3 ) :
benefits for smaller communities
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , yesterday during question period i was listening to the proceedings and there was one question that i didn &apos;t quite get .
for clarification i would like to direct my question to the deputy premier .
this question was asked by mr. alakannuark about what kind of support or benefits the smaller communities that are not receiving decentralized positions would get .
having read the documents , there are smaller communities where they have put in one position for a one year term only .
what kind of support or what kind of programs will come up in these smaller communities in nunavut .
what kind of support , or how will the smaller communities benefit from the decentralization plan .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. barnabas . deputy premier , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i can &apos;t speak specifically under the decentralization plans , as you know that is the responsibility of the premier .
i can say from a broader government perspective , from all programs and services that we provide throughout the distribution of the budgets and for all departments , all communities will benefit .
thank you , mr. speaker .

question 304 - 1 ( 3 ) :
day care review
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i asked this question yesterday .
there are a lot of things that we will have to review as we are a new government .
there are a lot of things that the government had stated they would have to do a review first before anything gets done .
there is also the issue of day cares .
are we going to be looking at the results or is there going to be anything done after the review process is completed .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. akesuk .
mr. deputy premier , mr. ng .
i believe that question was directed to the deputy premier .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , there is a review being undertaken by the department of education who has the responsibility for that area .
i will ask the honourable james arvaluk to respond to that in more detail .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
i apologize maybe i wasn &apos;t clear enough .

thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. deputy premier .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i think i understand the question a bit better and he can correct me if i &apos;m wrong .
in respect to work that had been undertaken by the gnwt , the programs and some reviews of policies .
this government as you know will undertake and has indicated that we are going to undertake reviews and are in the process of undertaking some reviews as well of different programs and policies .
obviously some of the work that had been done by other jurisdictions , there was some substantive input from whether it is nunavut municipalities or organizations , depending on what the policies were .

thank you , mr. speaker .
thank you for your question mr. alakannuark , i will try and answer .
the programs that we are going to bring out for elders and youth are not only coming from my department but from other departments as well .
as of today we are still working on the policies that we could use for the elders and youth .
the policies that we are working on right now are just about in their final stages .
we are in the final stages of finishing off some of the policies that we are working on .
thank you , mr. speaker .

my last question .
again to the minister of culture , language , elders &amp; youth .
regarding inuit qaujimajatuqangit , what are you doing in regards to this .
there is survival and also the making of inuit clothing .
what types of programs , or what have you done to enhance the inuit qaujimajatuqangit .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
minister of culture , language , elders &amp; youth , mr. havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
just the other day i rose to speak about the elders &apos; and youth initiatives .
our goal is to finish and have funding put in place to assist the communities deal with elders &apos; and youth initiatives through inuit qaujimajatuqangit .
the funding is there for that purpose .

question 306 - 1 ( 3 ) :
inuit qaujimajatuqangit in schools
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question is directed to the minister of education .
i think it was around december we went visiting communities in nunavut .
during our visits there was a concern about inuit qaujimajatuqangit being included in the school curriculum .
has that been done by the minister and his staff .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , it would be a lengthy response .
so mr. speaker , if you want me to respond just to the curriculum , i would be able to do so .
in arviat they have a plan for the curriculum and the curriculum will be implemented in arviat schools from kindergarten to grade 12 .
as well we are doing the directives and doing the planning in this regard and it will be coming in conjunction with inuit qaujimajatuqangit .
whenever we do planning for curriculum or for directives , or even when teaching the teacher education program , we always try to make sure that inuit qaujimajatuqangit is there to guide us .
i expect that culture , language , elders &amp; youth will be able to work with us on this .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
another question that i have is , the elders in our communities will they be utilized and will they be trained in regards to this .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
yes , we will be utilizing elders and the elders will be trained .
with the gnwt this was not done before and the elders will be used to develop curriculum to be used in schools .
for the adults to be able to go to the schools and be able to teach their knowledge to the students .
the baffin divisional board of education use to develop curriculum at that time .
i also mentioned that there are quite a few curriculum that have already been developed for the elders to be able to produce curriculum to be used in the schools as well .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the minister stated that this is in the planning stages .
i just wondered whether there will be a teacher hired in every community who is unilingual .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
whenever we have teachers in the schools , some cannot really teach other subjects .
if we are going to get a teacher for high schools that individual has to be trained in teaching the high school students .
as well we have to hire teachers that are qualified to teach different grades because all teachers are not knowledgeable in teaching all levels of grades .
we cannot just ask somebody to teach a certain subject that they don &apos;t know how to teach .
so we are going to have to do those kinds of plans , we just can &apos;t hire somebody to teach those kinds of things .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
last question by mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
yes , i understand that mr. speaker .
but we have wanted to find out what is happening from the department and we know that we will have to get inuit teachers , males and females .
like the women can teach the students how to make clothing and the male teacher will teach hunting and going out on the land .
but the question that i have is that because we have elders that can teach many subjects can we utilize them more than we do today .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
yes , i said before that we had elders that are learning to teach in arviat .
but for the elders that &apos;s not the limit of their knowledge to do teaching in making qamutik and igloos and sewing .
they can do a lot more but what we are talking about is , mr. irqittuq is talking about the elders to be able to teach children about their knowledge in a traditional way .
to teach about family relationships and other types of knowledge known by elders .
that &apos;s what he is talking about .
to be able to make clothing and to make qamutiks and igloos , those are the things that we are dealing with right now in arviat .
as soon as we right down what the elders need to know to become teachers , then they will start teaching them .
thank you , mr. speaker .

thank you mr. arvaluk .

question 307 - 1 ( 3 ) :
housing corporation tender
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question is to the minister responsible for the housing corporation .
mr. speaker , i was looking in the paper the other day and noticed an invitation to tender in there for the nunavut housing corporation .
i would like to ask the minister why the reference in that tender is to be done through the nwt housing corporation and not the nunavut housing corporation .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr tootoo .
minister responsible for the housing corporation , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the question by the member is perhaps there is a typo or mistake in the tender .
i &apos;m not really sure exactly which tender he is talking about so perhaps i will have to look to it and find exactly what the mistake was .
so i will get back to the member .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you , the minister has taken the question as notice .

thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr mclean .
minister for culture language elders and youth , mr. havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
again as soon as we get all those numbers together we will hear that .
and also to the policy , there is again consultation on these and we will be incorporating all those .
hopefully that will assist us to better help our youth that need the facilities .
thank you , mr. speaker .

nunavut power corporation plans
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
prior to my question , members of the qikiqtarjuaq youth group are in the building .
please welcome them .
mr speaker , my question is to the minister of the nunavut power corporation .
i found out that the operations information is now going to be available .
what is the plan for the nunavut power corporation .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister responsible for the nunavut power corporation , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr speaker , i would like to thank the member , as always , for questions on the power corporation .
the member asked about what plans are there for the power corporation .
hopefully , over the next two weeks , mr speaker , we will be announcing the name of the person that has been selected as the new president of the nunavut power corporation .
the first step will be , mr speaker , will be to have that person in place and then we will be looking at the president , who will be hiring staff .
as mr mclean said , looking at baker lake as the headquarters and hopefully looking at a timeline and a time frame to start staffing positions there .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr picco , minister responsible for the nunavut power corporation .
member for uqqumiut , mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker , for the answer to my question .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
a commitment was made to baker lake after decentralization numbers came out last june in apex .
mr speaker , the community of baker lake has the necessary infrastructure , have the logistics , have the administrative capacity .
we think mr speaker , that they have the ability to staff those positions directly from baker lake .
mr speaker , there is no one in this government forgetting about the smaller communities .
we are looking at that and trying to move forward , mr speaker .
clyde river was not selected as the power corporation headquarters , because we are replacing the jobs of decentralized communities .
in that case , mr speaker , it was baker lake .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. picco .
member for uqqumiut , mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i understand very well their response .
clyde river was not selected .
that is what i understand .
is clyde river always going to be a deficit situation .
are we just going to be wasting money for energy costs .
is that going to contribute to your expenditures .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
minister for nunavut power corporation , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
indeed mr speaker , i lived at clyde river and i looked at it as my 2nd or 3rd home , probably after hall beach , where i spent a lot of time .
what i can say to the members and the people of clyde river and to this house , is that the government of nunavut is not forgetting about the smaller communities .
we are trying to work in a co-ordinated approach to bring other opportunities to those communities that we talked about earlier .
mr speaker , the community of clyde river is in the position right now of getting a new power plant , and we discussed that in house before .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister .
mr. iqaqrialu , supplementary .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
final supplementary to my question .
as you indicated , we don &apos;t have enough infrastructure to accommodate the relocating of staff .
can you provide for new infrastructure for our community .
that would be the only way that we become able to accommodate new staff members in our community .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. minister picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr speaker , as i said earlier , the nunavut government is try to look at opportunities for other jobs .
i &apos;ll give an example , mr speaker .
mr speaker , we have a lot of patients right now , in the south being taken care of in different jurisdictions .
maybe there are some opportunities there to bring those types of infrastructures to nunavut .
but that &apos;s just one aspect of different things that the nunavut government is trying to look at .
i can &apos;t commit right now , mr speaker , to putting infrastructure or particular jobs in the community of clyde river , under the mandate of health and social services .
the government of nunavut is trying to look at opportunities and ways that we can build on capacity in our smaller communities .
mr. speaker , that &apos;s one of the things that myself as minister am trying to do .
hopefully with the standing committee of this house , we can discuss some opportunities , maybe during the budget session , when we debate the health department &apos;s budget ;
which is the only department i can speak for , mr speaker , because there may be an option of moving things forward .
thank you , mr. speaker .

oral questions :
item 6 .
mr. barnabas .
question 310 - 1 ( 3 ) :
housing subsidies
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question will be directed to the minister of the housing corporation .
there is a problem in that the ceiling limit was changed and it was accessible to people with higher income levels .
but now recently i &apos;ve found that due to the higher gas and oil costs , people are reviewing the home access programs and the allowed incomes .
i understand that it has been raised from 235 dollars to 517 dollars .
this has been increased by 100 % , mr speaker and we are already paying extremely high costs in the high arctic area for our food , our gas and other necessities .
i am wondering if there is some kind of subsidy provided from the housing corporation in order for people to access these programs .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr barnabas .
minister for the nunavut housing corporation , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i wish to thank the member for raising this issue .
as it is after the price increase of gas , it became difficult for many people to stay on top of these price levels .
even as the price of groceries increases , whether it is for maintenance of housing costs it &apos;s difficult for us to keep up with the inflation rates .
i understand this difficulty , but under my budgets for my departments which you will be seeing shortly , we have been mandated to build a certain number of houses within the communities .
so , either we build houses in communities or we don &apos;t .
and since we have been mandated to provide construction of houses we have to consider it as a priority .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. thompson .
member for quttiktuq , mr barnabas
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i know that the government employees receive a subsidy , once they have their own housing .
they are still given housing allowances on top of their salary .
but even through negotiations with housing corporations prices will continue to increase .
will you be providing housing allowance for people if this is not changed to accommodate the lower income people .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. barnabas .
minister for nunavut housing corporation , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i think we are all aware , mr. speaker , that income support is being reviewed by the minister as he indicated earlier .

thank you , mr. speaker .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of culture , language and youth mr. havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
we are still working on the policy to make them more effective .
we were working on the policies to accommodate the facilities for the youth .
like i said earlier our department in new in the government of nunavut .
we have to review and implement these policies we have .
we have to have a public consultation with the communities as well .
so , like i said earlier we have to have input from other communities as well .
so , our youth workers and staff are working very hard .
which programs that we could use that would be more suitable to our youth .
while we &apos;re working on these policies , we &apos;re working on the funding as well that we could use .
if we don &apos;t have any funding to get off the ground , we have to have a good policy to work with first before we can go on .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. havioyak .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
i believe what the minister implied with his answer there , that they had not developed a policy last year to administer funds that were supposedly committed for youth facilities last year .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak :
thank you mr. speaker .
for the member &apos;s clarification on the question , i am not sure if it was on the facilities from last year .
is that what you are saying from last year .
on the other hand , is it on the operations &amp; maintenance .
could i get clarification on the question .
thank you .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
please clarify your question mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
i was pretty sure i had that commitment last year .
i was just wondering did the minister develop a policy to administer those funds last year .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of culture , language , elders &amp; youth mr. havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak :
thank you mr. speaker .
i will try to answer your question .
last year , when we first became a department .
we started working on policies that we could work with .
in order to be more effective to the youth and see what type of facilities that we could come up with in our communities .
that is what i stated last year .
last year when we first started , we didn &apos;t have any funding that we could use .
that is why we didn &apos;t come up the new facilities yet .
as of today we are still working on some funding we could use for the youth facilities and some drop in centres .
we did not have all this last year .
we didn &apos;t have a capital plan last year .
we are still in the stages of reviewing our new policy that we are working on and see what kind of policies were going to have today and tomorrow and our future .
this is not an overnight thing that we could put together .
we have to work on these in due time .
it &apos;s too bad we didn &apos;t have this funding last year when we first started .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. havioyak .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i &apos;m not sure if the minister understands the question .
i &apos;m not talking about any capital funding .
i &apos;m talking about operations &amp; maintenance funding that there was a commitment for last year and the finance minister said that there would be money there for these types of programmes .
i was asking the minister , after they made that commitment of having that funds available , did they have a policy to administer it .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of culture , language , elders &amp; youth mr. havioyak .
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
we are still working through these policies .
these operations &amp; maintenance dollars have to be put in place for the facilities that we are going to put it in place for the youth .
we can &apos;t do it without these operations &amp; maintenance .
right now i can &apos;t really answer you in terms of how much funding . so that we can have an idea how much operations &amp; maintenance we can use .
thank you speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. havioyak .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr speaker , again i &apos;m not asking how much money .
mr. speaker , i &apos;m asking did the minister and his department develop a policy to administer the funds that they committed to use for these types of programmes last year .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of culture , language , elders &amp; youth , mr. havioyak .

bill 10 - an act to amend the boards of management dissolution act
hon. ed picco :
mr. chairman with me today for bill 10 , dissolution of boards of management act , is mr. armstrong who provides legal counsel .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister picco . you can begin with your opening remarks .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman the bill we have here today is an amendment to the social services dissolution act , which passed in this house in june 1999 .
mr. chairman the act that was passed last june did not spell out any administrative details that will arise from the integration of the three regional boards into the department .
bill 10 , in front of you today , addresses those details and will eliminate administrative confusion as this transition is achieved .
mr. chairman this bill has benefited from the thorough review it has received form the standing committee on education , culture and health .
i would sincerely say we appreciate the constructive debate we engaged in during my appearance in front of the committee .
because of those discussions , the standing committee recommended two amendments to bill number 10 , which were accepted .
accordingly , the reprinted bill you have in front of you today incorporates the amendments of the standing committee .
mr. chairman , speaking generally about the bill number 10 that you have in front of you , it addresses seven kinds of issues .
first , of all the assets and liabilities of the board will become assets and liabilities of the nunavut government after april 1 .
if a board owes anyone money they need not worry that they will not be paid .
the government of nunavut will assume that liability .
if anyone doubts who owns physical assets of the board now they will belong to the government of nunavut .
second , all contracts and obligations with which the boards are involved which extend beyond march 31 , 2000 will become contracts and obligations of the government of nunavut .
no one mr. chairman will be left with an invalid contract .
third , all employees of the board will become employees of the government of nunavut .
this amendment makes absolutely clear mr. chairman that no one &apos;s employment status is affected .
this provision carries with it the effect that no employee can claim that they have been dismissed just because the reporting relationship of the name on their pay cheque has changed .
fourth , whatever employee benefits may have with a board if they conflict with the employee benefits of a government position the provisions for the government position shall prevail .
this is a safety clause mr. chairman in the event it turns out that some small differences with benefits with individual employees .
fifth , whatever a board is obliged or empowered to do today the minister will be empowered or obliged to do after april 1 , 2000 .
the intent of that clause mr. chairman is to ensure whatever the situation it will always be clear who can act and in some cases who must act .
sixth , the boards have authorised certain things such as medical reviews and privileges through bylaws .
finally mr. chairman , the standing committee has expressed their commitment to establish a direct relationship between the communities and this department .
my cabinet colleges and i agree wholeheartedly , that the theme of simplicity and unity links initiatives like this integration with open , responsive and accountable government and the encouragement of public participation .
mr. chairman the amendment recommended by the standing committee clarifies the minister &apos;s ability to enter into agreements with communities .
having offered this overview , i am pleased to appear in front of the committee of the whole today to discus bill 10 , an act to amend the boards of management dissolution act .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister picco .
mr. nutarak your opening remarks on bill 10 , coming from the standing committee on culture , education and health .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
mr. chairman i thank you for the opportunity to speak on bill 10 , an act to amend the boards of management dissolution act .
the standing committee held a number of briefing sessions and meetings with the minister on bill 10 over the past few months .
in particular i would like to note for the benefit for all members of the house that our standing committee sought amendments on two different issues .
these were accepted by the minister .
first , this was stated when the government first proposed abolishing the regional boards of management .
we are very supportive of the creation and support existing local community health committees .
we believe that the involvement of local communities and local organizations will be essential if we are to deal with many of the health and social problems and needs of nunavummiut .
we applaud the minister &apos;s recent initiatives to work with hamlets in this regard and encourage his efforts to do more in the future .
although the new clause is very permissive and does not require agreements , the minister has stated his commitment to work with hamlets in establishing these relationships on health and social service matters .
the standing committee has advised that the statutory instruments act requires the government publish certain instruments in the gazette including regulations and appointments and certain directives .
this ensures that the public will have access to this information the regional boards of management were not required to follow the statutory instruments act .
however , the minister and his department are bound by it .
the standing committee felt it was very important to ensure that the status quo would change .
to the extent that directives and instruments that should fall under the statutory instruments act now that the responsibilities are under the department , they should in fact do so .
however , since the statutory instruments act does not apply to guidelines or policies in any event , the clause in the original bill was not necessary as a legal matter and was redundant .
the committee did not want to be any confusion as to whether the statutory instruments act should apply in other respects .
the standing committee is grateful to the minister for withdrawing that particular clause from the bill and it is not in the reprinted bill .
those are my comments mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
do we have any more comments .
thank you .
are there any questions .
the floor is open for comments and questions on bill 10 .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
i would just like to say again that the committee is grateful that you did withdraw the statutory instruments act issue .
we spent many weeks discussing with yourself and your legal counsel .
we did have concern over it and we appreciate the fact that you realised our concern and withdrew it .
having said that , this legislation is permissive .
the bottom line is that gives a great deal of authority to yourself as a minister , which we understand you should have .
i know you have the authority and the mandate to enter into agreements with third parties .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman first of all a very sincere thanks to the committee and to the chair for his kind words in the opening .
the chairman was correct that we did have some good discussion and debate on the bill itself .
that is why mr. chairman , we have held several conference calls and indeed i have made changes to ensure a level of comfort to the committee and to the members of the house .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
once again mr. minister we thank you for your revision i guess reflecting our concerns in regards to this act .
the minister indicated that he had spoken to 23 of the communities in nunavut .
can the minister confirm as to when these various hamlets will actually have a functioning body to look after this particular issue .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , that is up to each of the individual hamlets when they set up their standing committee of the hamlet .
but there are exciting stories and good news stories happening right now .
so , that is happening .
we feel that probably by the 15th of may most communities in nunavut will have the standing committees up and running .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. picco .
mr. o &apos;brien .
mr. o &apos;brien :
thank you mr. chairman .
i have another question for the minister .
in the rare case that a community does not set up a functioning body to deliver these services , what would happen then in that case .
how would the minister deal with that .
chairperson :
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , that is a good point .
i have committed to 5 thousand dollars to help with the administration , logistics of these committees .
i have already committed to the mayors with the premier during the baffin leaders &apos; summit to review that amount to see if there is a possibility of more money .
as you know mr. chairman , you were at that meeting .
we also have the opportunity to use our elected officials , our elected members of this house and the other avenues of logistics and advocacy issues being brought forward by other organizations .
for example , nti could be a local organization .
so , there are several different avenues that we could use to bring forward at the community level .
but the optimum mr. chairman , would be having the standing committees of health set up so that communities themselves can direct those types of issues and community concerns at the local level .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
first of all , in the first clause , under number five , the members of each board of management shall be deemed to have resigned .
i understand that this is what is written and it is effective on march 31 , 2000 .
it doesn &apos;t indicate as to whom will be deemed to have resigned .
i am uncomfortable with the wording because it would include hamlet subcommittees or the steering committees .
this seems to me that it could also apply to the other committees because the boards of management aren &apos;t made clear as to which committee it refers to under the management wording .
maybe mr. picco you can explain this clause as to who or which body it refers to specifically .
chairperson :
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
mr. chairman , in clause 5 in english it states that the boards of management shall be deemed to have resigned as quoted by the member .
what that is specifically dealing with is the health boards that we have in the three regions .
it has nothing to do with the hamlets or any other committee or ex-officio committee at the community level or in the member &apos;s community or anyone else &apos;s community .
it deals specifically with the boards of management as outlined in bill 10 , which is before us today .
so i think the member &apos;s concerns have been brought forward but in this case they are negated by the fact that bill 10 only deals with the health boards themselves .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
okay that would be much clearer now .
also , i wanted to get to this item .
mr. chairman , this measly sum of 5 thousand dollars is going to be used for a full year of operations , it &apos;s practically useless .
maybe when there is a mayor &apos;s summit in hall beach there was a motion to that effect but i was never in support of that idea even up to today .
these health committees are going to be given huge responsibilities in representing their communities , once they actually start their work .
this sum of 5 thousand is going to be way too small for their operation and maintenance and administration functions .
i would consider something more in the area to 20 thousand dollars as a grant or contribution to the committees .
we should change the figure from 5 thousand dollars because these committees need to be functioning and able to run properly .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco ( interpretation ) :
yes that measly sum of money that you claim is not so small .
it is a small amount but this amount of 5 thousand dollars is all that there is .
( interpretation ends ) mr. chairman , i said that i would try to put money on the table .
i have committed with every mayor that i have met with and there has been some good discussion .
when i met with the mayors in the baffin , there was a discussion about putting seven or 8 thousand dollars on the table .
mr. chairman , i didn &apos;t have that luxury at that time and i don &apos;t have that luxury at this time .
however , what i did say , mr. chairman , and i say it to this house , to the member , that i would review it .
we would review it as a department , the 5 thousand dollars to see the sustainability and to see what avenues proactively we could take as a government to use that money .
that is fully at the discretion of the individual hamlets .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you very much for your appropriate response and i believe that you are going to do all you can to review that figure and i do know that is going to go ahead .
i would like to see the minister of health and social services do his best to rectify that matter .
so , those are my two questions mr. chairman .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
last person mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i would like to ask a question of the minister of health &amp; social services and i would also like to take this opportunity to thank him for meeting with our standing committee .
if we are going to be setting up , you said that you would be using the health committees at the community level .
how much authority and how much power do these committees have .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i say to you that the standing committees on health in each individual hamlet will have the power that the hamlet gives it .
if the hamlet decides that the committee will be limited to advocacy issues for example , then that &apos;s what they would be doing .
what we are trying to say , mr. chairman , is that we are willing to go further into this devolution of programs and services maybe moving into the committees taking on more responsibility .
but at the present time we look at them as a community resource dealing with health and social issues right at the community level .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
thank you .
mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you for your response mr. minister .
my next question is in regards again to the community health committees .
once they are given those responsibilities and authority , who will be making the decisions on health and social issues .
would it be the committee or the hamlet and who is going to be recruiting the health professionals and nurses .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , unlike the health boards that were in place before that looked after bills , invoicing , payment of salaries and so on and so forth .
all those responsibilities now will be done with the department of health and that is what we talked about earlier with the cost savings issues .
the committee at the local level , for example in the keewatin region , some of the committees that are in place actually get involved in the hiring of staff .
for example , we would have some of the members of the health committee in situations where they would be interviewing nurses , social workers , and so on .
that could be done directly with and in co-operation with the health committee .
we see the health committees focusing on promotion .
that would be an example of what the health committee could be doing .
they could be cessation of tobacco or it could be other issues .
sorry about that .
you want me to slow down there , or keep going mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i think i have finished my response to the member and i am available for any other responses .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
the minister has finished .
general comments or questions .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
just a comment and to respond to mr. alakannuark &apos;s question .
but the hamlets at the community level could start up such programs , that is just an example and a supplementary to the answer that was given to mr. alakannuark .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
questions , comments .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
on item number 4 , it talks here about hospital insurance .
could you elaborate further on the types of insurance that we are talking about here .
i am asking this question for clarification .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
you can &apos;t reprimand me , mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , is the member referring to ( 4 ) on page 2 .
thank you mr. chairman .
okay , thank you mr. chairman , we have found it .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
possibly , i could elaborate on this question further .
doctors and prescription drugs , different types of prescription drugs , i would assume that prescription drugs are included in the hospital insurance , what about the prescription drugs .
chairperson :
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
the issue of prescription drugs and so on is outside the scope of the bill that we are discussing today .
it falls under the non-insured health benefits , that are provided by the federal government .
the member is correct those items for inuit , under that agreement that we have with the federal government , are provided free of charge .
that is outside the scope of this bill .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
general comments or questions .
is there anything further .
would you like to go clause by clause then .

mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
do we go directly to bill 14 for consideration of the clauses of this bill .
that &apos;s my question , mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
proceed , mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
on page 1 under section 2 .
this clause reads this act applies to the period of april 1 to may 31 , 2000 within the fiscal year ending on march 31 , 2001 .
this is the way it reads .
it seems to end may 31 and then it ends again on march 31 , 2001 .
i think there has to be a correction under that wording .
if so i would like to get this corrected .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman . mr. chairman the clause is correct .
what we are requesting is authority to spend money for the government from april 1 to may 31 of 2000 .
within the operating year of april 1 , 2000 to may 31 , 2001 .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i &apos;m going to rephrase my question further .
in the fiscal year 99-2000 , i am wondering if we are going to get that money from that fiscal year .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
minister ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
mr. chairman , i &apos;m not sure about honourable member &apos;s question .
he referred to the current fiscal year , i believe 99-2000 .
if that is the case , if there are any unspent funds from this year and it would carry over into the next year .
if that was his question .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i apologize , mr. chairman .
within the fiscal year 2000-2001 .
he was talking about appropriations .
is that coming from that fiscal year &apos;s money .
that &apos;s my question .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. minister .
hon. kelvin ng :
yes , the member is correct .
i thank him for clarifying that .
it &apos;s correct yes .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i wonder if the briefing was done yet concerning the money that we are finished dealing with .
we haven &apos;t gone to the main estimates and i see there is going to be a substantial amount already removed for april and may .
i am wondering if our budget for the new fiscal year is going to be short because we &apos;re going to take this money out of that budget to be .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
hon. kelvin ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
this is just an interim measure to allow the government to operate until the budget is passed .
the main budget .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
our budget then the appropriation is for 121 million dollars for the 2 months .
just within that 2 months is that my correct understanding .
if we don &apos;t spend that same amount are we just going to lose that money that is allocated under the appropriations .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
minister ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
no .
if we don &apos;t use the money it becomes part of the budget of each of the departments .
as i indicated once the main estimates that we have to review yet are finalized and are approved then the budget will supersede anything on this appropriation act .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i have no names on my list .
we had a name but he removed his name from the list .
general comments or questions .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman again this is just for the record .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman i did indicate that during a standing committee review .
that is the case .
yes .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman if we could go through each clause i wouldn &apos;t mind if we go through each item by item on page 2 .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
are we agreed clause by clause .
thank you .
thank you i was given glasses i forget from whom .
mr. kattuk .
section 1 on bill 14 .
interim appropriation act .
april 1 to may 31 2000 .
clause 1 agreed .
clause 2 , mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
item by item , i thought we were going to go through the numbers on page 2 .
item by item .
not the clauses .
okay all the clauses on the front and no use to go through the numbers on the back ..
i thought we were going through the numbers first .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
do you agree with mr. tootoo &apos;s suggestion .
the amounts appropriated for the period april 1 to may 31 2000 .
vote 1 , operations &amp; maintenance .
items 1 to 12 , operations &amp; maintenance .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman on that vote 1 operations &amp; maintenance dollars .
i just was wondering if i could ask the minister of finance to go through each department and explain what those dollars are going to be used for .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman . mr. chairman if i may , maybe i can do all 12 of them and answer questions afterwards .
if that is okay with the committee .
for the first three , legislative assembly , executive and intergovernmental affairs , finance and administration , basically it is two twelfths of spending .
april and may in other words , two months pro-rated or 16.7 % give or take a half a percentage point .
so , it &apos;s pretty straightforward .
item 4 , mr. chairman is human resources and that one is a bit lower than the 16.7 % . it &apos;s actually 13.5 % of their yearly appropriation for operations &amp; maintenance .
the reason for that mr. chairman is because there is no need for relocation costs early on in the year .
the bulk of hiring will be later during the summer type of thing when families generally finished school and prepare to make such moves .
for justice , item 5 , item 6 public works , those 2 amounts again are roughly the 2 twelfths of their yearly appropriations .
item 7 , community government and transportation is a bit higher , roughly 20 % of their appropriations requested , mr. chairman .
primarily it is because of contributions to municipalities that they have to do quarterly versus monthly .
so there is some additional up front needs there .
again , this is primarily because of quarterly contributions to divisional boards of education that they give out in advance .
item 10 , health and social services is pretty well at the 16 % mark ..
sustainable development is one that is about 25 % of their appropriation .
again , it would be in respect to some contributions in advance .
item 12 , the housing corporation falls right into the 17 % range .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) : general comments .
mr. tootoo . mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman i think most of it is pretty straightforward .
just on number 12 on the housing corporation .
in the minister &apos;s budget address he talked about some leasing of new units .
i am just wondering if any funds for those leases are included in this interim amount .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. ng .
which one you will respond .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman i don &apos;t have that specific detail for each request as i indicated , i gave each department .
we put together the information .
i don &apos;t know if the minister has the specifics either .
whether or not there are specific amounts for that .
i have specifics for the capital appropriations .
i knew that there was more of an interest there .
so , for the operations &amp; maintenance end of things , given generally the 16 % or the 2 twelfths budget , we didn &apos;t get into too much detail .
we didn &apos;t ask for too much detail , quite frankly from each of the departments on that .
i know there was more interest as i indicated on the capital end of things .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) : mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman i guess i was worried about the leases for projects that may not be approved .
i can see it &apos;s assuming continual leases .
i guess my concern is that they will be new leases signed before the whole program itself being approved in the house .
i know it would be pretty tough once those leases are signed to get out of them .
so , i just would want to ensure that they are not signed before the departmental budget being approved .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. ng hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman i can assure the member that that would not be the case .
as i indicated in earlier discussions before the standing committee , we don &apos;t anticipate any award of any leases .
the capital projects wouldn &apos;t take place before this house rising once the final main appropriations are completed .
as we all know we &apos;re targeting a date just before easter .
april 20th roughly four weeks away .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) : questions .
if we don &apos;t have any more , final item .
operations and maintenance appropriation . one hundred and 6 million dollars and 63 thousand , agreed ?
some members :
agreed
chairperson ( interpretation ) : under part 2 .
vote 2 capital .
capital items .
capital appropriations . eighteen million 447 thousand .
minister ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , if i may address the capital needs i think the members are bringing forward about the detail on some of the capital that &apos;s being requested .
i could read each department and then answer your questions .
for public works 3.9 million dollars . i &apos;ll list each project and the amounts for that , mr. chairman .
cape dorset , for fuel tank increases , capacity code upgrade , 805 thousand dollars .
baker lake increased capacity , code upgrade 980 thousand dollars .

thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) : we have two members who raised their hands .
member for tunnuniq , mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
i thought the other fellow over here was the eldest .
thank you , mr. chairman .
to public works , i know i have the detail concerning capital appropriations .
under that detail is also included for the nunavut housing corporation the amount of 3 million dollars as an appropriation .
can he indicate to me what this details .
does this include housing projects , just what projects does this encompass .
thank you .
chairperson : minister ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
the member brings up a good point , the housing corporation is at the end .
i was going by order , what i was trying to do was go by each department and answer questions as i go .
however , if members want me to read it all off for them , it is up to them how they want to do it .
i was proposing that we go by department .
i think it is more manageable that way , mr. chairman .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
community government and transportation .
under number 14 , 582 thousand .
my friend beside me keeps interrupting me .
i will just wait until we get to those items then .
i am sorry .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
we are reading public works .
do we have comments on the public works details under that item .
mr. ng , maybe you can continue with community government &amp; transportation .

comments or questions from the floor .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
in regards to pond inlet , i didn &apos;t really write it down , i should have written it down . i just wondered if you could repeat that .
chairperson :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
mr. chairman , pond inlet sanitation site , 185 thousand dollars .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
we wanted a renovation for the arena in pond inlet .
it is not in this capital funding .
will they be doing some renovations in this summer .
chairperson ( interpretation ) : thank you .
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i am only speaking to the interim appropriation capital requirements for each department .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
yes , it &apos;s not in the capital interim amounts but we are going to be doing the planning on the pond inlet renovation of the arena .
chairperson :
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
these appropriations will be contracted and they have to be able to get the materials delivered by ship , that &apos;s the reason why i asked about the pond inlet renovation on the arena .
that was my question , thank you .
chairperson :
mr. anawak .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
also , the garbage site that is to be dealt with by this appropriation here .
i just want to find out from the community government &amp; transportation minister whether there was going to be more .
i thought the funding would be more to renovate or to restore the garbage dump .
it was closed down because of health reasons , it had to be about 400 metres away from the community .
the environmental health officer had to have it moved away from the community .
the hamlet i think we are going to need a little bit more money than that .
therefore , because of the environmental health officer &apos;s request to move the garbage site away from the community i feel that the money is not enough .
we would like to be able to get some lots opened up after we fix up the foundation from where the garbage site was .
chairperson :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
the money is just for the planning i think and some of the money would be for the clean up of the site .
we would be asking the department of health to make sure that the site that was restored after the dump was restored , whether there could be lots designated for building houses .
( interpretation ends ) we have to ask for a waiver once we have done the project for the completion of the work for that sanitation site .
then for the rest we would ask for a waiver from the department of health .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
is that it .
mr. akesuk .
mr. tootoo .
mr. minister , you could go ahead with your next detail .
item 15 , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :

questions .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i am not sure , maybe the finance minister can correct me or not .
this shows here in the cambridge bay high school total capital of 7.9 million dollars .
we just heard from the minister responsible for culture , language , elders &amp; youth that there is another half a million dollars going into that project .
that would bring the total up to 8.4 .
i don &apos;t know if this is the place to ask if there is any more money going in there .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
i don &apos;t know exactly how much of a total culture , language , elders &amp; youth are asking for , maybe the minister can answer that .

mr. chairman , was there any note of dollars being allocated in there for retrofit programs where materials would also need to be ordered .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i conveyed the items that were in the housing corporation &apos;s interim appropriation request . there is nothing that says retrofit now .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
under nunavut housing corporation , i mentioned the lots for pond inlet .
this is just a comment .
i would like to go clause by clause now , mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i would like to ask the minister of finance if we agreed to this interim appropriation act , i just wondered whether there is any money left .
is there any way that i could put more money into the arena icemaker for sanikiluaq .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
who is going to be responding to his question .
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
my last question .
for the minister of education .
there is 1 million 500 thousand there .
what is that going to be used for .
bringing the material for the items that you mentioned or is that for shipping costs to bring the materials for the baker lake school for example .
the reason why i am asking that is because the school in pond inlet is way too small and we have to order some materials .
are we not going to order materials for the pond inlet school .
if you can understand me mr. chairman .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
these funds obviously wouldn &apos;t be for any substantial construction materials .
it &apos;s to allow the tendering process to continue or to actively initiate it and get the ball rolling on some of these projects , mr. chairman .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
is that it .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na itsivauta . i know baker lake has been brought up quite a bit today in capital .
but if we look at a percentage , i only have 100 thousand dollars for the design of the school where clyde river got 550 thousand .
it looks like the kivalliq is short-changed compared to the baffin and the kitikmeot .
that is my only comment today .
i will get into this more about the distribution of dollars into the baffin region in the committee of the whole .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
but recognizing the differences , like in the case of cambridge bay , one major school project will throw a small capital budget , the percentages out of whack temporarily .
it has to be recognized that much as we would like to you don &apos;t have a budget like this every single year in every community .
so again , it goes back to what i said in the budget address and during questions before the house .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i agree with the members here , we are just looking at interim amounts for two months .
chairperson :
just a comment .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
i would like to ask a short question to the minister of finance .
i believe he was talking about cambridge bay and that they are not going to make be getting these huge amounts every year .
does that mean that they will be getting a smaller amount next year .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
well again , time will tell , mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
if there are no further comments .
i don &apos;t believe there are any further comments .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
if i could clarify a little bit to mr. mclean , in comparison to clyde river .
we had to order materials for this summer immediately , and that &apos;s why we have to do the project design right way because it is in very bad shape .
but in baker lake 100 thousand will be just to consult the community , talk to the community about what kind of school they want before we actually go into design of the school .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
that was just for further clarification .

minister &apos;s statement 88 - 1 ( 3 ) :
youth facilities clarification
hon. donald havioyak :
thank you mr. speaker during oral questions yesterday i may have misunderstood through the interpretation of the honourable member &apos;s question on youth facilities capital project for the fiscal 2001 .
i wish to clarify this issue through my statement .
mr speaker , my department has committed $ 500,000 for youth facilities capital funding for year 2002 / 2001 fiscal year .
this capital funding once approved by the legislative assembly will initiate youth facilities projects or existing facilities renovations .
in order for the youth groups to access this initiative , our department will establish a policy through the cabinet for the funding to be administered fairly and appropriately .
mr speaker , as for the operation and maintenance of the youth centres , our department does not provide funding .
however , it is desirable that we do provide funding in that the youth centres are successful and continue to operate .
our department is exploring this matter , and we &apos;re hoping to find ways to address this .
thank you , mr. speaker .

minister &apos;s statement 89 - 1 ( 3 ) :
youth / elders conferences
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) thank you , mr. speaker .
the statement i &apos;m going to make is quite lengthy .
i rise today to speak to the house about nunavut &apos;s most recent youth / elder conferences .
my department helped organize and participated in the three regional conferences .
the qikiqtani youth annual general meeting was held from november 29 through december 3 , 1999 .
the kivalliq youth and elders conference was held from december 15 to the 18 , and the kitikmeot conference was held from january 18 through to the 21 , 2000 .
elders and youth participated from each of the communities to discuss and evaluate youth issues .
my department used these opportunities to learn from the youth and elders , asking them what their concerns were and what direction they felt their government should be taking .
it was very informative to hear the elders concerns about youth as well as their advice .
it was encouraging to find that there was a great deal of consensus and focused direction amongst our youth .
these were the main concerns identified at all of the conferences :
lack of youth facilities for meetings , various projects and drop-in centres .
lack of or no access to communication tools for youth groups , for example telephones , computers and fax machines .
youth school dropout rate is very high .
suicide and other health related issues are not adequately addressed in most nunavut communities , for example alcohol , drug and solvent abuse .
healing groups or workshops are not easily accessed by youth and youth are often not comfortable participating .
some youths are not motivated to join in youth councils or programs .
lack of or limited access to funding on youth or elder / youth programs and / or training .
lack of community involvement on youth issues , for example hamlets or churches .
youth hesitate to approach elders due to lack of language skills or are intimidated by elders or adults .
lack of further education programs both in english or inuktitut / inuinnaqtun in most smaller communities than regional centres .
lack of inuktitut / inuinnaqtun language or cultural programs in or out of schools .
this clearly indicates a direction for our government to follow . the following were recommendations that the elders and youth made together in response to the concerns .
create an access centre for various funding programs federal or territorial in the communities . establish communication links between communities and regions using existing resources , for example hamlets , schools or youth organizations .
the consultations we carried out during these conferences showed me that although there is a long way to go , it is clear that our youth and elders are dedicated to working together .
thank you , mr. speaker .

nunavut arctic college annual report 1998-99
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i am pleased to table to the house in a little while the annual report of the nunavut arctic college .
the full printed copy in inuktitut and english is now available for your information .
the college &apos;s annual report contains interesting information about the colleges &apos; successful 1998 / 99 year of program services delivery .
details of the programs provided by each campus and the nunavut research institute are also included .
( interpretation ends ) the second major highlight of the report is that nunavut arctic college has been able to clear all deficits carried forward since 1997 .
mr. speaker this is a significant achievement for the college .
these initiatives include the following :
information systems development , the college revitalization plan and one time only improvements to the college &apos;s operational budget .
part of the surplus will be used to acquire and install new computer hardware , software and applications to modernise the college &apos;s administrative and records functions .
some of the surplus will be fund the college &apos;s revitalization initiative which is part of the college &apos;s corporate plan for the period 2000 - 2005 .
under this initiative , the administrative structure of the college will be revised so that it can better provide support for the delivery of the programs and services equitably throughout nunavut .
finally , funds will be used for base budget operations to cover the costs of one time only initiatives .
thank you , mr. speaker .

nunavut senior assignment program
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , it is a great pleasure for me to rise today to congratulate those who have made our nunavut senior assignment program such an incredible success .
mr. speaker , the nunavut senior assignment program was co-ordinated by the department of human resources and was funded under the nunavut unified human resources development strategy .
this program , mr. speaker , is a great example of working together .
the government of canada , the government of nunavut , nunavut tunngavik incorporated , mentors and trainees .
mr. speaker , this program provided nunavut land claims beneficiaries with the opportunity to enhance their management , leadership and specialized skills while training and co-managing under the guidance of gn senior managers .
mr. speaker , the time and dedication of these mentors is most commendable .
up until now , one trainee was appointed early , two will continue with their training for an additional six months , one participant left the program and unfortunately , one participant passed away .
inuit participants in the program came from all three regions of nunavut play an important role in helping the government of nunavut establish a public service that is representative of our population .

gjoa haven hamlet representatives
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
i &apos;m glad to be able to stand up to speak .
thank you mr. speaker .
today i wish to rise on behalf of my gjoa haven residents and to congratulate them for when they were here .
from march 14 to 17th , they were here representing the hamlet of gjoa haven .
there are three people :
michael anguttitauruq , mayor of gjoa haven , and hamlet councillors , and director raymond kamookak , director of finance .
while they are here will be meeting with three departments .
they met with health and social services department and they also met with the education department to express their concerns in regards to the two schools that are in our community .
primarily they were more concerned about the elementary school .
the other is the high school .
they also have their principal along with them .
however , they have some concerns that have been raised by these people .
because they have been running into problems in the school cause these two schools have one cafeteria and they also have one library which have been used by both elementary and high school students .
the two schools are overcrowded .
there has been some health problems in these schools because of overcrowding .
they want to have their own gymnasium as well and a dining area .
that is why these delegates from gjoa haven are here to meet with the departments to voice their concerns .
mr. speaker they also with the minister of health and social services to voice their concerns regarding community health committees in the community .
they also would like to have their own secretary manager for the health and social services committee .
i &apos;ll be asking questions on this issue in the house .
speaker :
your time has expired .
do you wish to continue with your statement .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i am requesting permission to complete my member &apos;s statement .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
the member has asked to continue his statement .
are there any nays . there are no nays .
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
they have also met with the department of community government , housing &amp; transportation to also to raise their concerns .
their main concern was they don &apos;t have enough of water delivery services or a reservoir in their community .
they also have a concern about their airstrip which will probably need repairs .
sometimes we get seven flights in one day .
we have been receiving daily flights coming into this very small airstrip .
this has been a safety concern as well .
the community of gjoa haven has a population of over a thousand .
so , i think we should be one of the priorities when it comes to airport enhancements .
mr. speaker these concerns have been raised also when it comes to government decentralization .
for these reasons , my constituency has some concerns about these .
so i will be asking questions during question period to address some of these concerns , and mr. speaker i would like to thank all departmental officials who met with us .
thank you mr. speaker .

sanikiluaq men &apos;s hockey team
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i am going to elaborate more on my member &apos;s statement yesterday .
the sanikiluaq hockey men &apos;s team has been invited to play a hockey tournament in nunavik .
now i think it would be very appropriate if a hockey team from nunavik would be invited to nunavut .
the sanikiluaq hockey team came in second place and they were trying to achieve the hudson bay trophy .
i &apos;m very proud of the hockey team who represented sanikiluaq .
they won the silver medal and i would like to congratulate these people .
mr speaker i have been talking quite a bit about the arena in sanikiluaq .
it has been utilised for a few months now , since january 21 but then last week they decided to close the arena .
they use this particular arena for two months so i will be requesting an icemaker for the arena during this budget process .

inuit qaujimajatuqangit
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
thank you mr. speaker .
congratulations for becoming the new speaker .
mr. speaker members travelled to communities for budget consultations .
during our visits to the three regions , it became evident that before all the elders pass away we need access their traditional knowledge .
there is a lot of traditional knowledge that will just go to waste if we don &apos;t start communicating with our elders .
i would like to speak on this issue .
as a member of the legislative assembly representing my constituents , i told them that i would work towards working with elders .
i think its becoming more evident that we have to deal with elders and youth before all our elders pass away .
when they do pass away their knowledge dies with them .
for that reason inuit qaujimajatuqangit will have to make some concrete decisions if we want to make this a priority at the community and government levels before all our elders pass away .
although we don &apos;t have any curriculum in the schools , we can still learn a lot from our elders .
in addition , i think this has to be a priority for us .
we have to push towards communicating with our elders and during question period mr. speaker , i &apos;ll be asking questions about this .
thank you mr. speaker .

when i was a member of parliament , i think it was in 1994 , when the northwest territories got their inuk commissioner for the first time mrs. helen maksagak .
we were quite proud of because we got a nunavut resident as commissioner .
on saturday we heard from the minister responsible for the department of indian affairs and northern development that nunavut will be getting our own commissioner , mr. peter irniq .
i was looking for him in the gallery , but he is no longer here .
every where we travel he knows people in all the communities , especially the elders .
i grew up with him , i went to school with him , and i know that he is a hard worker and i know that he will enhance the traditional values .

return to oq 286 - 1 ( 3 ) :
municipal legislation review
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i rise to respond to a question put to me on monday by the member from south baffin regarding the municipal law review .
this review will examine legislation to determine what parts require updating in order to conform to nunavut &apos;s particular needs and circumstances .
it will help the government fulfil its bathurst mandate obligations to promote self-reliance within our communities like giving councils the ability to make decisions where they matter most :
at the local level .
such an undertaking will require enough time to review existing legislation as well as review the study already taken by the government of the northwest territories and the nwt association of municipalities .
we will determine what can be used by nunavut , what can be adapted and what needs to be redrafted .
time will also be required in order to complete a full consultation process .
this process will include six to eight months of consultations with members of the legislative assembly , the municipalities and other interested parties .
it will also involve consultation with other jurisdictions that have held similar legislation reviews in the past .
( interpretation ) this review will be undertaken in co-ordination with maligarnit qimmigujiit &apos;s government-wide review of all legislation that is currently under way .
once the consultations and review of municipal legislation has been completed , we will be in a position to move ahead with any required redrafting of relevant legislation .
mr. speaker , while i cannot commit to a specific time frame of this review i can assure the members that the bulk of the consultations will be completed in this fiscal year .
these amendments , which can be done concurrently with the full legislation review process , will address some of the easier changes that can be made .

question 313 - 1 ( 3 ) :
francophone school size
mr. kattuk :
thank you , mr. speaker .
a few days ago i asked this question of the minister of education .
he stated that in that school that is going to be built there were going to be about 35 students in the school .
the question that i have is how many classrooms are there going to be in that school .
speaker :
mr. arvaluk .
minister of education .
hon. james arvaluk :
mr. speaker , i am sorry i don &apos;t look after the designs and things like that , i would ask the appropriate minister for public works to answer that question .
thank you .
speaker :
minister of public works would you like the member to repeat the question .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the member for sanikiluaq could probably perhaps ask the question so he could clarify which school he is talking about .
speaker :
mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. kattuk .
i believe now that the minister of education is signalling that he will answer the question .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i am sorry i didn &apos;t really understand the question .
i didn &apos;t know it was the classrooms he was asking about .
the francophone school that is going to be built in iqaluit today we know that there could be thirty-five students going to be entering the school .
i could not tell you how many classrooms there will be at this time .
i know there will be thirty-five students .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the minister last year stated that i don &apos;t have to have an interpreter from sanikiluaq but i think the minister didn &apos;t understand the question that i asked .
he should have understood the first question that i asked , but i guess he didn &apos;t understand my second question .
the school that will be built how many classrooms will there be not how many students will enrol .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. arvaluk , minister for education .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i understood you .
i am not sure about the design of the school and i don &apos;t know exactly what the design will consist of and how many classrooms it will have .
it will be just answered by the people who deal with the design of the school .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the school in question will probably cost about 2 million dollars to build , with 35 students enrolling into that school .
for this reason , i would like to ask a question .
that &apos;s the things that we always say that the people that have to take inuktitut courses should be more assisted rather than others .
thank you .
speaker :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
i feel that we will be able to negotiate with the federal government if we cannot fill the school , the francophone school , we will be able to use it for other teaching .
many schools are being filled rapidly and it will probably be used by other students instead of just francophones .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you minister arvaluk .
oral questions . mr. tootoo .
question 314 - 1 ( 3 ) :
location of heritage centre
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman or mr. speaker , sorry .
mr. speaker , my question is for the minister of finance .
mr. speaker my question is very simple , has a decision been already made to allocate the 500 hundred thousand dollars to locate the heritage centre in cambridge bay .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker as i indicated yesterday i wasn &apos;t aware of exactly what the department of culture , language , elders &amp; youth has and what they expect to fund under their programs .
so , i would say that obviously there has been some discussion and some evaluations undertaken within the department that i am not aware of .
so , i would say right now that it appears that there is a contribution that may go towards the heritage centre project in cambridge bay from the comments of the former minister .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
so , i would like to ask if such a project had been approved by the financial management board .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
no .
no specific project has been approved by the financial management board .
it hasn &apos;t been approved for allocations or disbursements yet .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker in the comments that were made yesterday it seems quite clear that it is indicated that those funds are allocated for our proposed project in cambridge bay , mr. speaker .
if , as the minister indicated yesterday in his comments , there are funds allocated towards that region why don &apos;t the main estimates reflect that .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker first of all to clarify , grants and contributions , it depends on where the distribution and where the decision making for the policies would take place .
now , the member brings up a valid point in that the department of culture , language , elders &amp; youth , i &apos;ll use c.l.e.y. , the department of c.l.e.y.
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. tootoo , final supplementary .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i guess , mr. speaker , the minister explained his explanation of the process but it still would indicate that there was an anticipated expenditure in a specific region .
if it &apos;s in there mr. speaker , i believe it would have been shown in the regional breakdown .
i ask again the finance minister why it wasn &apos;t .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
there is no regional distribution as a result of that .
thank you , mr. speaker .

oral questions .
mr. puqiqnak .
question 315 - 1 ( 3 ) :
smaller communities &apos; access to banks
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is directed to the minister of finance .
particularly the smaller communities , the communities that do not have access to banking facilities .
mr. speaker however , at this point in time we have not seen any available services pertaining to banking in smaller communities .
i represent two communities .
they are small communities who do not have any access to banking .
we can do some banking in cambridge bay and in larger centres .
i want to ask the minister of finance whether he has made any plans for banking facilities in the smaller communities , so the people can have better access to them .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister of finance mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i regret to advise the member that i have yet to follow up on that important issue that he is articulating on behalf of his communities .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you .
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i want the minister to understand me , i know he understands where i &apos;m coming from but this is a major concern .
especially in the smaller communities where government employees as well who make their money as employees and who have jobs and they don &apos;t have any kind of banking access in the smaller communities .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i recognize the importance of the issue the honourable member brings up .
i would be a bit reluctant at this point to subsidise any bank in respect of some of the possible costs of trying to provide some service .
having said that , i am told that the royal bank does do regional tours of communities to outline what services they have to offer .
like i said , we will follow up with the royal bank officials and others to see what possibilities there are .
thank you , mr. speaker .

question 316 - 1 ( 3 ) :
grise fiord school renovations
mr. barnabas :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question will be directed to the minister of education .
( interpretation ) i want the minister of education to see if he will proceed with the materials being shipped to my community .
i think they had done all the planning for the shipment .
however , they decided not to proceed with this , so i am wondering if the minister can state whether they will be doing it this year .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , yes , we want this to go ahead .
however , we cannot do anything until the members of the house approve the budget .
we don &apos;t know whether we can have the okay by the members .
however this will still be planned but of course we don &apos;t know what the weather will be like in the fall . yes , we would like this to go ahead though .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
supplementary , mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i did not quite get what the minister said mr. speaker .
because i was told that the project would go ahead in the next fiscal year , so i &apos;m just wondering what the minister is saying about the money .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
however , like i said , i can make the information available as to where the funds went and i will be reviewing this as well .
if the m ember wants an immediate response to his question , i could take his question as notice and reply to him later in the afternoon or tomorrow .
i know this is an urgent matter and i do not want to make any promises to the member at this time before the budget is approved .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. arvaluk the question is taken as notice .
oral questions .
mr. akesuk .
question 317 - 1 ( 3 ) :
kimmirut airstrip
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is directed to the minister of transportation .
i want to ask the minister what his plans are for this airstrip in kimmirut .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. akesuk .
minister of community government &amp; transportation , mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
regarding the kimmirut airstrip , we will be receiving contributions from the federal government .
this is one of the urgent things that i will have to deal with .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :

mr. alakannuark .
question 318 - 1 ( 3 ) :
cost of living in nunavut
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
minister of transportation , mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
when we first started this session i stated that we will be working on transportation and we have initiated the review .
we are going to be reviewing the transportation issues and we will be reviewing how the goods and services are delivered up here .
we will also be looking at the freight costs .
so , we will be reviewing all this .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. anawak .
mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the reason why i am asking this question is that the cost of living is increasing at a rapid rate especially our daily necessities for our children .
i know that parents are going through hard times and they can &apos;t afford to buy their daily necessities .
i was wondering when you would be reviewing that .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
as i have stated before this review will go ahead with mike ferris as their leader .
also , as i have stated before , we will be working with the other jurisdictions during the review process and this review process will be a good start .
thank you , mr. speaker .

mr. iqaqrialu .
question 319 - 1 ( 3 ) :
clyde river social worker
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i didn &apos;t get an opportunity to congratulate you on being selected for mr. speaker although i &apos;ll regret and i &apos;ll miss you on this side of the chamber .
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i will be asking my question to the minister of health and social services .
as he was asked yesterday , for a long time in kimmirut they weren &apos;t able to get a social worker , it &apos;s the same case for my community too .
while we were waiting for someone to apply , while we were waiting to hire someone as a social worker we could have taught a local person to become a social worker .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister responsible for health and social services , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker the position for social worker in clyde river has been vacant for quite some time .
there may be an opportunity for one of the people to apply for the position in kimmirut and indeed in clyde river .
at the same time , mr. speaker the department is moving aggressively to advertise and re-advertise for the positions .
so that we can get a full complement of social workers not only in clyde river but in many in of our communities where we don &apos;t have one at the present time .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
oral questions .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i know we have students that are taking that kind of program .
if the students don &apos;t want to move to another community . i &apos;m sure we won &apos;t be able to hire them locally .
if the students want did not want to go to another community to become a social worker , i &apos;m sure it will take a very long time to hire another person .
so , i was wondering if we can make room to fill these positions although no person is interested in moving to the community .
would it be possible to resolve this .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
mr. speaker it goes without saying the role of a social worker in our communities is very important as the member knows last week that we celebrated social work week .
indeed , i met up with the head of the northern social workers association who represent the northwest territories and the yukon , and there is a shortage mr. speaker of social workers .
that &apos;s why arctic college has moved aggressively to train people .
there is also a program in cambridge bay that graduated social workers .
i &apos;m not trying to say mr. speaker , that i agree with the member that it not acceptable to have a social worker in place .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i understand your response .
it was very interesting to hear .
however , i would like to supplement my question by asking whose regulations have you followed during this process .
whose rules are you following or abiding by with this process .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
hon. ed picco ,
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker as the member knows at the present time the health boards are still in operation and the three regional health boards have been trying to hire the staff .
not only the social workers but also the chrs , the nurses and so on .
they follow the guidelines in hiring the principles and policies , outlined by the government of nunavut in the personnel manual .
so there are guidelines in there that are followed .
for the job description of the social worker that the member i believe is talking about , that &apos;s also put in place by the regional health boards .
that &apos;s what they are trying to follow .
we want to be able to find qualified people to do the job .
mr. speaker , we do have two social work diploma programs on-going .
they are two-year programs .
one is in cambridge bay and one is in igloolik .
the opportunity mr. speaker is to start another program to start training people here in the baffin .
maybe south baffin or around clyde river .
so , we can actually get other trained people into those positions .
however , mr. speaker , let me make it clear .
we &apos;ve asked again through my good offices to have those positions filled and we are trying to fill them .
we are using the guidelines that the government has in place .
the health boards are following the guidelines .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you speaker .
thank you for giving me a response , however as the nunavut government , we are amending all the legislation of nunavut .
i &apos;m not too sure if we dealt with that legislation .
that &apos;s why i asked this question and i thank you for giving me an adequate response .
perhaps as the new nunavut government , we will have to amend the rules , regulations , and policies so that these policies will come from nunavut and be made in nunavut .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you .
oral questions .
mr. nutarak .
question 320 - 1 ( 3 ) :
alcohol committee by-laws
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i won &apos;t congratulate you now since you have received many congratulations from around the table already .
i would like to direct this question to the minister of finance .
i think it was last summer or fall that i asked him in regards to the local alcohol committees .
according to them , they don &apos;t have any rules , regulations , or by-laws for those committees .
perhaps , i &apos;ll just explain my preamble .
in some communities they have controlled liquor access by the local alcohol committees .
i had asked this question previously where your position is .
his response was that he would take it as notice .
i was wondering where your answer is mr. speaker .
thank you .
speaker thank you mr. nutarak .
i believe the question has been directed to the minister responsible for the liquor board mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i don &apos;t recall taking a question as notice on that matter , but if that were the case certainly i &apos;ll find out and clarify .
i &apos;m not exactly sure .
maybe i could ask the member to clarify the question to me .
i can try to answer it or provide the information .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i had asked a question in regards to liquor access .
we do have a liquor store in nunavut now but we have to order our alcohol from yellowknife and you need permit to order alcohol from outside of nunavut .
that has to be approved .
as you have stated goo arlooktoo , the liquor licensing board chairperson will have to deal with that .
so , i asked a question about that .
once we became nunavut government , every since we became a nunavut government , the legislation of liquor has been a problem .
therefore , i would like to ask the minister about that .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. nutarak .
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i thank the member for clarifying that .
he is correct that i have asked the liquor board to make some recommendations about the distribution of alcohol .
they haven &apos;t had an opportunity to report get back .
quite frankly , mr. speaker the fact is that they got into their positions as you know late in the fall .
they had to deal with some pressing issues .
in respect to liquor licence applications here in iqaluit and some hearings to enforcement issues .
i don &apos;t believe they have had that opportunity yet but i will follow up , now that the matter has been raised again to try to move forward on this matter .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
since your reply has been that you will look into that and you &apos;ll go ahead , probably i &apos;ll wait a year for your response again .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. nutarak .
i don &apos;t hear a question unless mr. ng would like to respond .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
first of all , mr. speaker i don &apos;t believe it was a year ago that the member asked the question because we weren &apos;t sitting here a year ago .
since it is a high priority for the honourable member i &apos;ll make sure we get the information as expediently as possible .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
&gt; &gt; applause
speaker :
we will continue with oral questions .
mr. irqittuq .
question 321 - 1 ( 3 ) :
inuit cultural teachers
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i would you to say my name properly because it sounds a lot like akesuk .
my question is to the minister of education .
i took the opportunity to ask him a few questions , but he never answered my question directly .
i ran out of my time .
i grew up with the minister of education , kind of , although he &apos;s a bit older than i am .
i was from hall beach and he was from igloolik .
we speak the same dialect and he understands exactly what i &apos;m trying to say .
but yesterday during question period he didn &apos;t seem to quite understand where my question was coming from and he was going all over the place .
my question yesterday was is the department of education getting plans underway so that we can have inuit teachers out in the field .
the reason why i &apos;m saying that is because we are missing the traditional knowledge like igloo building , survival and other issues like that .
it is very critical at this point that we get cultural teachers out there .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister responsible for education .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you for being the new speaker .
and , yes , i do understand exactly where the member is coming from because of course we speak the same dialect .
i tried my best to answer your question yesterday .
he &apos;s talking about many issues , there &apos;s culture , language that we talk about and getting cultural teachers who are experts in the inuit culture .
and when they are talking about the elders as teachers or instructors , we have many inuktitut teachers who are very well versed in inuktitut and they created books through the baffin divisional board .
we now have fully fledged inuit teachers and there is quite a few of them .
i believe the member is talking about the elders who know about the culture or the old cultural values , inuit clothing making and so on .
yes , were working on it .
like i said yesterday , in arviat there some inuit linguistics that are being put together as a language material .
i would like the member , my colleague to understand that the kind of teachers , if we &apos;re looking at the kind of teachers that we are going to be producing .
yes , we have produced teachers through the arctic college .
so , how are we going to utilise the arctic college .
what kind of teachers are we going to producing .
those are the types of things we have to do .
so , that we will know about the cultural values .
i don &apos;t believe that we will ever regain all the knowledge that we have forgotten .
we will only be able to get the ones we know today and what &apos;s available out there .
we do try to use the arctic college to produce those types of programmes .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you hon. james arvaluk .
i will try to pronounce the names of members properly .
i &apos; still working on mr. picco &apos;s name .
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you speaker .
i understand exactly what mr. arvaluk is to say .
if the money is produced , there are already some very qualified teachers in the communities already .
do you have that in the plans .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
yes , mr. speaker .
we have that .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you for your positive response .
i &apos;m very glad .
so when are these funds going to be made available .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
hon. james arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. speaker .
we do have the same dialect .
i don &apos;t think i understood exactly what your question was .
i thought your question was have you considered .
now the question is all of a sudden when are the funds going to be made available .
can you clarify your question please .
speaker :
mr. irqittuq :
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
well when you take it into consideration , we always have made a decision already .
when we take this into consideration , there is dialogue between us .
we put out a tentative date on when the funds are going to be made available .
that &apos;s the direction of my question .
speaker :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
possibly today or tomorrow we will elaborate further when we start working on the details on education aspects and so on .
however , it very hard to give you a yes or no answer .
because there are lot of programs out there .
there are qualified teachers that went through the ntep program and we have an agreement with mcgill university .
they teach inuktitut from kindergarten to grade 6 and some to grade three .
they teach in inuktitut and just this fall we &apos;ll be putting together some curriculum for grade seven to grade twelve .
i believe what the member is trying to say , whether if the cultural and traditional knowledge values , shamanism , survival or any other inuit traditional knowledge will be taught .
i believe that is his question .
and , yes were trying to put plans together which is going to be hard work .
nobody has ever produced that type of programs before .
what usually happens is that we give the types of programs that the communities want .
for example , qamutiq making , tanning , sewing , and things that even the middle age people know .
those are the types of programs that are requested by the schools .
now , what were trying to do is try to put some things together that will preserve what we forgot know .
the ayaiya songs , the shamanism and so on which we will lose forever when the elders die , that is what the member is talking about .
possibly through recording or data collecting or producing books .
we &apos;ll put plans together .
in the financial plans and again in arviat they &apos;re putting together some objectives and i believe my colleague heard it .
mark qalluaq and the other elders are working in arviat on these projects .
on behalf of all of nunavut , they &apos;re putting together some plans on what should be included in curriculum or in the programmes in the schools .
once this is completed we &apos;re looking at completion in the fall .
from there we &apos;ll look at the 27 communities and see how many elders are available .
for example , walrus hunting techniques in hall beach .
somebody over there in arviat might not know because they don &apos;t have walrus .
if we are going to be setting those types of programs , curriculum developments and so on , we can &apos;t say we want these types of elders .
it &apos;s going to take quite a lot of work to produce .
my colleague knows this but we have to set up a plan and objectives if were going to including any more .
were not going to stop here when it comes to language and cultural aspects of teaching .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
i hope the member found an answer in that .
we have one more question i believe .
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
yes , he answered some of my questions .
but , my main question is and i will be rephrasing my question .
perhaps if i made my question much clearer i would have had a better response from the minister .
so with those in mind i feel that we should have some kind of program that addresses those middle aged people .
i was not so much concerned with story telling and inuit songs .
what i was trying to say is i think we should be preparing those people to enter the workforce .
that was my main concern and i was asking the minister if we could put some kind of funding in place .
mr. speaker , if i could seek unanimous consent to extend oral question period .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
i will ask the minister to answer the question first and then we will deal with the request for the extension .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
yes the member knows very well that the distribution that we put to communities that will be used for cultural programs usually depends on how many students will be enrolled in such programs .
it is usually up to the local education committees to decide what funds will go to what instruction that will be held in the schools .
they will have to try to decide how many instructors they will have in a classroom and how many students will be admitted into these programs under the old policy .
we have been trying to deal with this new policy that we want to put out but apparently some communities are still going under the old policy .
there are two different policies .
speaker :
question period is now over .
mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i seek unanimous consent to extend the sitting hours of oral question period .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. kattuk would like to continue question period .
are there any nays .
there are no nays so we will continue but first we will take a fifteen minute break .
then , question period will be extended by one hour .
sergeant-at-arms .

oral questions . mr. iqaqrialu .
question 323 - 1 ( 3 ) :
nursing positions in smaller communities
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the minister that i was going to direct my question to is not in the house , so i will be directing my question to the premier .
qiqiktarjuaq also has a shortage of nurses and professionals in the community . so i &apos;m asking the premier if he will be staffing more nurses in the smaller communities this year .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
i would remind the member not to make note when a minister is not in the house to answer your question .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the minister of health and social services had to leave town this afternoon and i thought we would be ending this session earlier .
his meeting is with the federal minister of health and for that reason he is not in attendance this afternoon .
i just want to clarify that .
i will take the question as notice .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
the question is taken as notice .
just a reminder to the members when a question is taken as notice there are no supplementary questions to follow .
mr. tootoo .
question 324 - 1 ( 3 ) :
breakdown of budget surplus
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker my question is responsible for the minister responsible for finance .
mr. speaker in the minister &apos;s budget address he talked about a 34.1 million dollar surplus .
mr. speaker , on top of that he alludes to another 17 million dollars that went to offset the health board deficits that were incurred .
mr. speaker that to me is a grand total surplus of 51.2 million dollars .
mr. speaker , i &apos;m wondering if the minister could provide the members of this house with the breakdown by department what the surpluses are .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister responsible for finance , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .

nevertheless , could the minister provide the house with the information , by department , that was used to come up with this temporary number .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
yes , from the preliminary number from each department i would be able to provide the numbers once the departments &apos; budgets come up for review .
speaker :
supplementary , mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i was wondering if he could provide it sooner than that .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
well i just thought it would be convenient at the time when we had some substantive debate on it and it was part of the department of finance &apos;s budget review .
but if the member wants it earlier and the information is available , i would be willing to provide it .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .

oral questions .
mr. mclean .
question 325 - 1 ( 3 ) :
analysis of airstrips
mr. mclean :
thank you , i will wear my yellow shirt tomorrow .
my question today is to the minister of transportation .
we take it for granted when we are flying around this country , myself included , personally i &apos;ve done more flying in the past year than in the last forty .
my question today is for the minister responsible for the airstrips in nunavut .
does the minister &apos;s department do a comprehensive analysis of the condition of the airstrips on a yearly basis or a bi-yearly basis .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , we have an ongoing report of the state of the airstrips in nunavut .
it is updated whenever there is a need to work on an airstrip and i will use an example of whale cove where the rocks were showing and we had to do some work .
we are kept up to date as to what shape the runways are in through the department of transportation .
speaker :
thank you mr. anawak .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you .
that is reassuring to know when i &apos;m flying in and out of my home of qamannituak that the tires aren &apos;t going to blow off and i &apos;m going to crash and burn .
will he make that available to me .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i have not been a minister of transportation for the last twelve years but i will make that information available .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. anawak .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you i will sleep a lot better tonight knowing that .
is there any criteria in there to decide what becomes a jet strip because i know we are past the dc-3 stages in our life up here i hope .
i was wondering in the minister &apos;s criteria and evaluation does he consider what strips could be lengthened to accommodate jet travel .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak :
thank you .
but i would like my colleagues to know , and the residents of nunavut , that there are three airstrips that are priorities .
kimmirut , pangnirtung and the third one is repulse bay because they are either too close to the community or their airstrip is too short .
we do review all the airstrips in nunavut for safety reasons but once we review the safety standards we will include the members of the legislative assembly and give them the opportunity for input .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you minister anawak .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na uqaqti .
would the minister be looking at that .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak :
i will be mentioning the need for better runways and longer runways for some of the communities .
i know there are a number of communities that would like to lengthen their runways .
speaker :

mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker i would like to make a supplementary to mr. alakannuark &apos;s question .
i will be directing my question to the minister of education .
in the high arctic there are no job opportunities and many people in our ridings do receive social assistance .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. barnabas .
your question , starting question , is directed to the minster of education .

i will table the results .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you .
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to get clarification about the review committee , will you have review committee too for the high arctic ?
will the review committee &apos;s members include members from the high arctic residents ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker :
minister responsible for education .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
we selected the members who worked in the social services field and they have lived in various communities .
we would like to hear from sanikiluaq to grise fiord from kugluktuk to qikiqtarjuaq all across nunavut .
they won &apos;t be touring all the communities but when i met with them yesterday morning , i advised them to review it and don &apos;t think about what the government &apos;s positions are .
i want them to review and be sensitive to the needs of the local people .
as i stated before to the members of the review committee it will be totally up to them and i leave that open to them .
they can make recommendations on any initiatives .
we gave them all the information and i expect that whether you are from the high arctic or whether you come from another community they will consider those communities .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. arvaluk .

mr. iqaqrialu .
question 327 - 1 ( 3 ) :
clyde river hamlet finances
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to direct my question to the community government minister .
twice i have asked the question in regards to the clyde river hamlet finances i have never received any answer in regards to this .
i was wondering if the minister could provide to me a document with the progress report or the status report .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
however , i have not received a response from either of the individuals .
i am very willing to sit down with the mayor of clyde river but at this time there is some changeover happening right now .
therefore , this question perhaps can be dealt with through a meeting with the mla and with their representatives from their community .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. anawak .
oral questions .
mr. nutarak .
question 328 - 1 ( 3 ) :
heritage centre location
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
there was a person that had his hand up on the other side there but they are pulling to get me back so here my question will be directed to the minister of finance .
this is an additional question regarding heritage centres .
i &apos;m wondering just where this heritage centre will be because this question was asked already but it was not responded to .
where do you plan to put up this heritage centre ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
as the honourable member mr. tootoo asked this question earlier it &apos;s apparent there have been some funds targeted towards a heritage centre in cambridge bay .
once the departments &apos; budget comes up before the house and more detail can become available and more discussions surrounding that . thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
and this will be only in cambridge bay this half a million dollars ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , again i don &apos;t have that information .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. tootoo .
question 329 - 1 ( 3 ) :
heritage centre commitments
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker i believe my question can be directed to the minister of finance .
mr. speaker or you can pass it onto the appropriate person if i picked the wrong person .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i think i made that quite clear when we spoke about the interim appropriations mr. speaker .
i think that it is important to recognize mr. speaker , that there is also not just government of nunavut funding targeted for some of these enhancements there is some private funding as well .
once again , the projects come before the house and substantive discussion can take place .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
oral questions .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
again , mr. speaker if the minister wishes to pass this along to a more appropriate minister please feel free to do so .
at the time when we were there i noticed that cambridge bay has a very beautiful visitors &apos; centre which at the time was closed .
mr. speaker i &apos;m wondering , if the department allocation of funding for a heritage centre to cambridge bay is it based on ... what criteria is it based on .
what will happen if in fact they already have a facility there that seems to serve the same purpose .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker . mr. speaker , i &apos;m not the minister of c.l.e.y.
and i have no intentions to be minister of c.l.e.y. and hope the premier hears this .
&gt; &gt; laughter
thank you mr. ng .
final supplementary mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker based on the minister &apos;s comments it would have to follow policies developed by the department of c.l.e.y. again earlier this week it was inquired as to what those policies were .
it was indicated by the former minister those policies were yet being developed .
mr. speaker , i am wondering how cabinet can approve something like that if there is no criteria for the allocation for those dollars .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
it seems to me i will be the c.l.e.y. minister .
the allocations mr. speaker were obviously based on existing grants and contributions policies that culture , language , elders &amp; youth has within their area of responsibility , cabinet approved policies .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. barnabas .
question 330 - 1 ( 3 ) :
capital projects for smaller communities
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i &apos;m just trying to refresh a question that was asked yesterday of the minister for community government .
i would like to re-ask a question that was asked by my colleague mr. alakannuark who represents the smaller communities where we &apos;ll have no new government staff .
under the main estimates you plan to build new arenas , new schools , renovations to schools and etc .
with other capital projects and how will you help the smaller communities by way of projects .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
premier okalik .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
this is not a new issue as we are all aware it &apos;s been ongoing for a long time .
we have not forgotten the smaller communities .
we try to plan for their future and this will be an on-going process .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. premier .
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker this government is the one that initiates programs and presents them to the communities through the mla &apos;s with our support and they are supposed to seek input .
are we going to see this happening .
are we going to continue to see ongoing job presence in the smaller communities .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
yes , if we can get help from the elected representatives of the smaller communities regarding any opportunities for their futures or developments in their community we are more than willing to listen .
we &apos;re not interested in short term plans we want longer term plans because it &apos;s a good thing to see the developments happening in smaller communities .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
it &apos;s been over seven months since we held sessions in this house and our tenure has been for that length of time .
mr. premier keeps indicating plans of his government but when are they actually going to be initiated and implemented when will we see these things happening .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
they want to see parks , they want to see schools , they want to see the other developments keeping in mind their future .
i visited my friend &apos;s constituency and i know there is a mine in that area and it will be shut down .
i am not afraid to suggest that it be reverted into a school but we do try to find opportunities for development , we are open to the communities , their ideas .
if they want further information or if they want more assistance through the department of sustainable development .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
oral questions .
mr. irqittuq .
question 331 - 1 ( 3 ) :
changes to igloolik decentralization
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i had asked the finance minister before , i don &apos;t think it was in the house but this is what i asked him .
there was a bunch of those positions that were not filled , so how much of that money is still left over mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker if i understand the member &apos;s question there were jobs vacant as we all know within government we are not fully staffed up included in those vacancies are decentralized positions .
the funding is there but because of the fact that those positions weren &apos;t filled we have the surplus situation .
for the upcoming year as we move into staffing up the decentralized communities those dollars for the positions are there . the dollars for the recruitment and relocation of those employees are there .
it &apos;s a matter of identifying individuals now that some of the office space some of the housing is becoming available and moving individuals to start staffing up those positions .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
supplementary .
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the surplus is what i am asking about i &apos;m just wondering about how much you have saved from not staffing those positions .
how much is a surplus from not filling those positions .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i don &apos;t have the specifics of just decentralized positions if that &apos;s what the honourable member refers to .
the 34 million dollars that &apos;s projected for surplus at the end of the year two days from , three days from now .
whatever it is mr. speaker , is a result of all unfilled government positions throughout the government of nunavut and all unexpended funds as a result of the support for some of those positions .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i know that this is complicated but i would like to see the levels because it &apos;s very obvious that the allocation and the numbers would be different .
you get so many offices here and you get so many positions there .
they &apos;re all budgeted differently for each community .
whatever was not used should be able to be printed out .
how many positions were filled , how many positions weren &apos;t filled .
i &apos;m sure you have that information available .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
minister ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
you know our responsibility is to recognize globally , nunavut-wide where our fiscal position is .
i guess in more detail once the departmental budgets come forward again next upcoming fiscal year .
then we can get into more positions and where they are slated to be going .
mr. speaker .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
oral questions . mr. akesuk
question 332 - 1 ( 3 ) :
kimmirut arena location
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i thought you would never get to me .
my question will be directed to the minister of finance .
i am happy to see some of the figures have been made public including for the arena in kimmirut .
but there seems to be a shortage of space .
i understand that they found an alternate space for this project and it has been moved .
i &apos;m wondering if you &apos;ll be able to provide the full funding for the arena considering it has been relocated to another spot .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. akesuk .
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , the delivery for the project of the kimmirut arena rests with the community government &amp; transportation department .
i understand there are some problems in finalizing a site i believe .
we feel the minister &apos;s put forward an adequate appropriation for the project to proceed in a substantive way , this coming fiscal year .
speaker :
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk :
mr. speaker if you allow me ask a question to the community government and transportation .
( interpretation ) thank you mr. speaker .
my question is directed to the minister of community government , &amp; transportation .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister of community government and transportation .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
for that reason we have allocated 900 thousand for the construction of the new arena .
we want to finalize the location come april 1 .
we will have to find out who will be designing and constructing the building .
we also have to consider the shipping season .
therefore , we will be dealing with this matter in an urgent way . in an urgent manner and we have already allocated some funding for that project .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. anawak .
oral questions . mr. tootoo
question 333 - 1 ( 3 ) :
staffing levels of gn
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question is for the minister responsible for finance , administration and human resources .
mr. speaker , the minister in his budget address indicated that our staffing levels are not fully staffed .
i guess everybody recognizes that and the hard work the staff do .
can the minister inform us what the percentage the government is staffed to right now .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
i believe i made a statement to clarify the numbers during our recent rankin inlet session .
the percentage is approximately seventy five percent .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
supplementary , mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i just wanted to be refreshed on that .
i appreciate the minister bearing with me .
could the minister tell me if the government &apos;s plan is to be fully staffed by the end of the next fiscal year .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
we try to plan on being aggressive and actively pursuing as much as possible recruitment of employees where there are vacant positions .
thank you .
speaker :
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i don &apos;t believe the minister answered my question .
i understand all departments have been aggressively trying to recruit members .
is it the projection of the government to be fully staffed by the end of the fiscal year was my question .
i would like to get an answer to my question .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , we hope to make as much significant progress as possible .
thank you mr speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
final supplementary , mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , given the minister &apos;s response that doesn &apos;t sound like they do plan on being fully staffed by the end of the next fiscal year .
if the budget that has been developed and tabled is based on being fully staffed , if that &apos;s not the intent that seems to indicate it isn &apos;t going to be possible .
why is it done like that and are we going to be looking at another surplus next year .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , one has to recognize that we factor some of the training needs and some instances we may be overstaffed in some particular areas because of the specific training requirements .
i can speak to some of the needs that are going to be identified and there is some funding coming forward for the inuit employment plan and the department of human resources .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
it may appear the members are being put further down the list .
we &apos;re just trying to be fair with the process .
next oral question . mr. puqiqnak .
question 334 - 1 ( 3 ) :
public housing arrears
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker my question is to the minister of the housing corporation .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
minister responsible for housing .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i also would like to welcome you back and congratulate you .
you haven &apos;t said a thing for a long time so i almost lost my voice .
when that happens they can review their mortgage again so that the person can be helped .
therefore , we have staff that do that kind of work .
we do have those counsellors too to help these tenants , private homeowners to keep up with their mortgage payments .
i was talking about their mortgage payments .
they &apos;ll be able to negotiate their mortgage payments again through the bank .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you ms. thompson .
supplementary , mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
thank you for your adequate response , minister of housing .
i &apos;m sure that is not the only problem that my constituents have . i &apos;m sure there are other communities with the same concern .
in one of my communities , i received a letter from one of the clients .
i will not name them but i &apos;m sure there are more people who have had a major problem with mortgaging their homes .
there are also some people who have a problem dealing with the banks and they have to pay their mortgages on top of that they have to pay their loans with interest .
this could be a very expensive thing to make house payments , food , clothing , what kind of assistance will these types of people have .
thank you speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
thank you for the member clarifying his question as well .
i &apos;m reviewing the rent scale too . i wanted to give out information on that and give it to the task force committee .
i wanted to give some kind of recommendation from the task force considering housing survey and i &apos;m still awaiting the response and recommendations .
so i &apos;m not sure what kind of review or response they will have .
hopefully i will be getting information next week from the task force survey .
when we did the survey , we were hearing from the people that they wanted the rent scale program reviewed so i &apos;m expecting to get some information coming from the task force .
but to date i haven &apos;t heard from them .
within the next week i &apos;ll be expecting to hear from them .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you ms. thompson .
oral questions .
mr. barnabas .
question 335 - 1 ( 3 ) :
language services division location
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i &apos;m going to direct my question to the premier .
during the baffin leadership summit they had agreed in that meeting that the language services are going to be transferred to igloolik but the headquarters was going to be in cambridge bay .
why is that the case .
that &apos;s my question .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. barnabas .
mr. premier
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
we dealt with that for quite some time .
we dealt with this .
we &apos;re trying to decide which positions would go to the communities .
prior to us becoming a government , all these things were pre-planned .
so we were reviewing whether we should follow the pre-planned ones like we were going to move this program into one community .
we didn &apos;t even know whether they were going to operate efficiently and we were going to move the health staff to pangnirtung .
if we did that it wouldn &apos;t have been viable .
so we had to be very careful in planning how to be effective .
so that &apos;s why some of the decisions that were made previously had to be changed .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. okalik .
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
if this had been reviewed , i know that it &apos;s evident that we are running into problems here especially when the language services are stationed in igloolik and the headquarters in cambridge bay .
are you going to move the headquarter to igloolik .
that &apos;s my question mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. barnabas .
time for question period is up .
i &apos;ll allow the minister to answer the question and also allow the supplementary questions to the member since his question started before the time was up .
mr. okalik .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
decentralization is a very hard task . it &apos;s not an easy task .
all the communities are anticipating positions and programs and they are expecting to have these transfers take place .
if we try to go ahead , i know it &apos;s going to cause problems , but i &apos;m going to review your question and take it as notice .
thank you mr. speaker .

the turn out at the ceremony was great .

beatrice was the mother of mr. anawak &apos;s adopted daughter amanda .
they both attended the funeral , mr. anawak has been very supportive of his family in repulse bay , and i would like to thank him very much for that .
when your dear family members do pass away , it is very nice to get a visit from a family member and get support from them while they are grieving .

member &apos;s statement 233 - 1 ( 3 ) :
project surname and disc numbers
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker mr. speaker i will be making my statement coming from my knowledge and nothing is going to be written .
i will be talking about my childhood .
when i was a child we were given names or treaty numbers or e numbers .
we were given this kind of disc e-5 numbers . we had e-5 and e-6 numbers depending upon what region you were from .
the numbers correlate to the region and i &apos;m very proud of that .
i know that this has been our identification for a long time .
after that there was a visit to all the communities by abe okpik with the surname project .
they were putting last names to each individual and he had written down where we came from at that time .
we appreciate him for the work he did .
because we had been identified and after our identification disc we were given surnames .
at that time we starting to use the written form and i &apos;m very happy and thankful .
i would like to say i am very proud to say that we will be using this identification card for the rest of our lives .
so i am very proud and happy to use that .
thank you mr. speaker .

mr. tootoo .
member &apos;s statement 234 - 1 ( 3 ) :
openness and transparency in budget process
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker my member &apos;s statement today is on the budget and the need for openness and transparencies in government .
mr. speaker before we start the examination of the detail of the 2000-2001 budget i want to express some concerns .
this week it has been apparent that the information in the budget may not necessary be presented in a totally open and transparent way .
mr. speaker all of us ran as candidates for legislative assembly on platforms of openness and transparencies and accountability .
i remember listening to the minister &apos;s speeches last year during the nunavut leadership forum and expressing those same ideas .
mr. speaker some of the events this week should give us a pause for concern .
what is written seems not to be the same as what is said in the house .
we should be concerned .
what it appears that not communities are treated fairly and consistently we should be concerned .
when evaluations , standards and criteria are not clear at best .
we should be concerned .
mr. speaker , it is vital the information presented to this house gives the whole picture not just pieces of the puzzle .
if this assembly is to make sound decisions , all members must have the information with which to base their decisions on behalf of the public . thank you mr. speaker .

members statements .
mr. akesuk .
member &apos;s statement 235 - 1 ( 3 ) :
unilingual patients
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker i have concerns of patients especially elders who are unilingual speaking people who are sent down south for medical reasons .
sometimes they do not even have escorts and more than once i have met people , elderly people who have been sent down south for medical reasons without escorts .
any they are very concerned about not having escorts going down to ottawa .
we were going down south to montreal for medical reasons and elders were sent down to montreal with no escorts because there was a person meeting them at the airport .
now that we are using the ottawa medical services the elders are going down by themselves and nobody is meeting them at the airport .
so therefore , i would like to get see this rectified sometime in the future .
thank you mr. speaker .

speaker :
members statements .
mr. anawak .
member &apos;s statement 236 - 1 ( 3 ) :
recognition of mike panika
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker sometime ago in the early seventies , negotiations began for self-government and land claims .
it seems we have forgotten the importance of those times .
we do not seem to honour all the work that was done in those days .
they never thought they see the realisation of nunavut .
that we would be actually be in nunavut with the working government for the people .
this was one of the endeavours , this is what they strive for in the days .
this was the main reason for the initiative .
we do recognise the odd worker of those days .
today i would like to recognise mike panika , who is living in rankin inlet now originally from coral harbour .
this man was not afraid to speak on our behalf and he is not afraid to speak to his member of the legislature .
he was involved in the initial negotiations under the inuit tapirisat of canada to pursue a land claims agreement .
he envisioned a more open government , a more accountable government , and a government closer to the people .
i think he can see this as a reality .
when he watches the nunavut government operate he is not afraid to talk to us .
my fellow colleagues ms. thompson and i met with him in rankin inlet .
i think we have to recognise some of the early workers of the time .
i know there are many other people that did a lot of work in those days .
sometimes we will be recognising them , but they have probably never seen the open government before this government .
they can see us in operation .
so i honour that man today .
thank you .

mr. okalik .
member &apos;s statement 237 - 1 ( 3 ) :
function in memory of inusiq akavak
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you speaker :
i was at a dinner function last night in memory of inusiq akavak who was murdered this year .
you have probably seen inusiq wherever you may be working in iqaluit .
she always had a smile on her face , as she would sell her carvings to you .
sometimes she sold brooches as well .
she was a happy person .
i was happy to see many people in attendance at her memorial ;
her relatives were there too .
we had a dinner nn remembrance of inusiq at one of the hotels and while trying to raise funds for the women &apos;s shelter here in iqaluit .
i was happy to see the member for iqaluit centre also in attendance , and of course , he beat me in the bidding .
i want to express my gratitude for those who arranged the remembrance dinner .
let us try to remember how we can help other people more .
thank you mr. speaker .

members &apos; statements .
mr. puqiqnak .
member &apos;s statement 238 - 1 ( 3 ) :
health care
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker all the communities in the kitikmeot have to travel elsewhere to go to hospital .
a lot of them require interpreters during their stay at the hospital .
sometimes they have to wait as long as two days to return to their community .
i am wondering why this is always the case .
this situation has been in existence for hospital patients for as long as i can remember .
people who work in the government , civil servants always have space on airplanes .
it seems to me that we do not give enough consideration to the average patient who has to travel to hospitals out of their community .
we should really take a good look at this and do a review .
i have a daughter who is considered handicapped .
she just fine it is just that she can not hear properly .
i can see the happiness in her life .
although she can not keep up with regular students , we were told last winter .
mr. speaker i seek unanimous consent to conclude my member &apos;s statement .
may i have concurrence mr. speaker .
speaker :
the member is seeking unanimous consent to continue with his statement .
are there any nays .
mr. puqiqnak you can continue .
mr. puqiqnak :
thank you mr. speaker .
this is just an example that i am using .
they were mining representatives in the jherico mines that were in our community .
who came to do some reports to the people of kitikmeot .
they gave us details on their staffing requirements .
like i said earlier , my eldest daughter is handicapped , and she asked me to find employment for her although she has a hearing problem .
she was not allowed to take any jobs but she was still smiling in spite of all .
little things like that i really notice .
so when i see people that are blind or people with other handicaps or people who otherwise cannot keep up with the average students , i always notice that they seem to be happy .
with this in mind , we as a nunavut government are we going to keep putting obstacles for their future endeavours .
we have to start making plans to accommodate them .
thank you mr. speaker .

recognition of hugh ungungai
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na uqaqti .
uqaqti i want to reiterate what my honourable colleague jack anawak &apos;s statement about nunavut builders .
i rise today to talk again of the coming of april 1 , the first anniversary of our swearing in as nunavut mlas .
i want to talk about a nunavut builder again , another person who is no longer with us but in my opinion was a part of building this territory .
he was one of the founding members of the inuit tapirisat of canada , a recipient of the order of canada and one of the first inuit businessmen in nunavut .
he was also a champion dog musher , an excellent man on the land and a local politician .
i would like to recognise a nunavut builder , hugh ungungai .

question 336 - 1 ( 3 ) :
inuit qaujimajatuqangit funding
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i would like to direct my question to the minister of finance .
since we created nunavut , we have been talking about our culture and our language , youth and elders because it is important to us , but the funding has not matched out concerns .
the previous minister talked about plans but it still has only one percent of the budget .
the capital items for projects are only 2 percent of the budget .
i want to know why it is like that when it is so important .
why is there not enough money .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
i think it is also important to recognize that it is not just their responsibility for acknowledging and incorporating that same knowledge and past practices .
it is the responsibility of all government departments whether it is through the education program , whether it is through similar development programs , through health programs , through justice programs .
thank you .
speaker :
mr. barnabas . supplementary .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
although regular members keep asking and requesting that the previous minister be given more money , it was not working for some reason .
so i want to ask , knowing the importance of other departments i want to ask why this important issue of youth and elders was not funded properly .
will it be funded more in the future .
speaker :

mr. iqaqrialu .
question 337 - 1 ( 3 ) :
medical escorts for elders
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
since this morning i have been receiving calls from my two communities , clyde river and qikiqtarjuaq regarding two elders that are going to a hospital down south .
they are not escorted and both are unilingual and both are ill .
this has been very upsetting to me .
the minister of health &amp; social services said that he was working on escort issues and i want to know what has been done about this .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
our minister of health is at a national health ministers &apos; meeting and this is one of the issues he is going to be dealing with .
i personally told him to emphasize this issue .
the transportation of patients down south is a very expensive program for this government and our unique situation should be recognized .
we need more funding in this area .
mr. picco will be strongly speaking on this issue .
we in nunavut do not have roads and if patients need to go to a hospital they have no choice but to fly .
we are working on the issue and asking for more money from the federal government .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. premier .
supplementary .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
the two elders are enroute right now .
can the government ensure that they travel safely and can this be done immediately .
one patient requires surgery and the other has shortness of breath .
i am very upset about this , if anything can be done i will be very grateful .
once again , this is an urgent issue .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
yes , i will direct my staff to check into this immediately .
the government is taking over health issues from the regional boards in a few days and we as a government expect these types of things to be dealt with in a better way .
we as a government will be in charge .
improvements are expected in the immediate future .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. premier .
before we go on with mr. mclean who i know is just biting at the bit to get his question in .
we do have a brief technical problem .
we would like to have the members stay in their seats and we will have the technicians make the changes .
please be seated and the technician will exchange the microphone equipment .
okay we will proceed to oral questions , mr. mclean .
question 338 - 1 ( 3 ) :
dsd regional superintendent position
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na uqaqti .
mr speaker , i would like to welcome the minister for sustainable development back , he was out on the west coast there where i have lots of family and friends .
they were talking about the green house effects , global warming and things like that .
coming from one of the coldest communities in nunavut , i know many other members don &apos;t want to hear this , but i don &apos;t really miss forty-five below anymore .
we are only getting forty below so i hate to complain about global warming but i &apos;ll take a few degrees while i &apos;m living up here .
my question today mr. speaker , is to the minister responsible for sustainable development .
recently there was a job opening in rankin inlet , the regional superintendent of sustainable development i was wondering if the minister could update me on when this position will be filled .
thank you .
speaker :
mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk :
thank you , mr. speaker and thank you mr. mclean .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na uqaqti . that is good news to hear because in the kivalliq that is one of the most important positions that we have over there .
i wonder if the minister , when considering filling this position , will have a representative from the business community or the keewatin chamber of commerce involved in the selection committee .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
at this time and looking at the schedule i cannot identify who will be on the interview team or whether those organizations that you mentioned will be involved .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. mclean .
supplementary . mclean :
ma &apos;na uqaqti .
i have to emphasise that the business community in the kivalliq is very concerned and they have to work closely with the individual who is hired to fill this position .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
ma &apos;na mr. mclean .
mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i am not familiar with the individuals concerned .
whoever is concerned with this position can direct their concerns to my department and to the people are responsible for hiring this person .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. mclean .
mclean :
if he would consider that i could probably call somebody over there to send them a letter to say they are concerned about being involved in the staffing of this position .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i lost my microphone but to answer your question if they want to be involved in the selection process i would like to see something in writing so we can make a decision .
i will wait for that letter then .
thank you , mr. speaker .

mr. tootoo .
question 339 - 1 ( 3 ) :
housing corporation tender update
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr speaker my question is for the minister responsible for nunavut housing corporation .
it was earlier last week that i asked the minister about a tender and she had indicated at that time she was going to check into it .
i would just like to ask the minister if she has made any progress on that issue .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister responsible for housing .
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i looked into it right away on the very day that the question was asked .
he was also concerned about the nwt housing corporation being involved in the tendering process .
i looked into it and it has to do with a shortage of employees or under-capacity in the nunavut housing corporation so we have the nwt housing corporation doing some of the work ..
the problem is we do not have enough employees yet .
the deputy minister of public works made an agreement with the nwt housing corporation and we are working together on technical services .
at the present moment we are using the nwt housing corporation to work on these issues .
thank you .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i appreciate the minister providing me with that information and i &apos;m surprised that it hadn &apos;t been looked into already with me having to ask the question on that .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
ms thompson .
hon. manitok thompson :
thank you , mr. speaker .
we did that because we didn &apos;t have enough staff and we didn &apos;t have the technical services people .
if there is anything else that is contracted back i will disclose it .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
supplementary mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :

speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister responsible for housing , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker i &apos;ll let the member know .
the housing corporation is now an entity on its own .
once we fill the positions and have our own technical staff this will become a better situation .
perhaps it will be easier by way of replying to you in written form .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you ms. thompson .
the question has been taken as notice and there will be no further questions on this .
oral questions , mr. barnabas .
question 340 - 1 ( 3 ) :
climate change conference information
mr. barnabas :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i have been watching the media and my colleague , the minister for sustainable development attending a meeting down south .
in my constituency in the high arctic scientists are always doing studies on ice and glaciers .
they have done scientific studies on global warming and therefore i would like to ask the minister if he could update us on the results of his meeting .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk :
thank you , mr. speaker .
yes , the meeting that i attended in vancouver to deal with this issue , all the canadian ministers of the environment and energy attended that meeting to deal with global warming issues .
at this point we are at the planning stages and the north is going to be greatly impacted from global warming .
at this point we are now working together to get a memorandum of understanding in regards to this subject .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you for your response mr. kilabuk .
i just wanted to confirm that the minister of fisheries and oceans has said that he will not be allocating funds for global warming research in the high arctic .
what is your department doing about that .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. barnabas .
minister kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
we met in vancouver to strategize and do some planning on how to deal with this issue .
this was just in the planing stages and once we have a strategy , in october all the provinces and territories will hold a conference this coming fall .
this meeting was just the planning stages so there was no concrete strategy that was agreed upon .
we will be strategizing in the next meeting .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you minister .
oral questions . mr. kattuk .
question 341 - 1 ( 3 ) :
medical escorts
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
i would like to ask a question that is the same concern as my colleague .
i will use myself as an example .
i have travelled through rough waters where i got scared in the past .
my colleague &apos;s concern with patients going down south for medical purposes and being scared is comparable .
two of his constituents going down south were not sure if they would be taken care of .
i know that is hard on these two elders .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
i did not hear a question but i think your question is whether we are working on this as we speak .
i think that is what my colleague asked .
we are looking into it and as the minister stated in this house they are looking into the issue of patients travelling down south , whether they are being escorted or not .
i will say they are looking into it right now and if we are told which elders have been mistreated in their travels down south then we can look into these problems .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk :

i apologise because i know you didn &apos;t quite understand me .
i am talking about the two individuals going to the hospital and they are travelling on the jet right now as we speak .
my colleague is concerned if someone will be meeting them at the airport .
as we speak i &apos;m sure the minister &apos;s office is watching the proceedings right now and are they doing something about it now .
speaker :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i can tell you that when patients travel to ottawa there is always an escort to meet them at the airport upon arrival .
we have heard of the mishaps and most of the problems are eliminated concerning trips and people picking them up at the airport .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. premier .
mr. puqiqnak .
question 342 - 1 ( 3 ) :
gjoa haven soccer team
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
for a while i thought i would not be recognized .
thank you .
i had some questions from my community and i will direct them to the minister responsible for community government and transportation .
mr. speaker , my question is the soccer team from gjoa haven is hoping to go to a soccer tournament in yellowknife from may 4 to 7 , 2000 .
however , they have to pay the registration fee by april 17 , 2000 .
they will need funding support to pay for their transportation , accommodation and registration .
they have sought funding from the nunavut soccer association and from the hamlet but there is none available .
can the minister please advise which organizations have the mandate to provide support for team travel .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
now i am copying that fellow across from me .
yes there are a number of sports teams that require funding and we will let them know right away .
for all those teams that are interested in obtaining funding from any of the communities and not just the ones the member mentioned .
there will be a discussion on where they can go to get information for assistance to find funding .
speaker :
thank you mr. anawak .
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
supplementary .
i understand the response from the minister .
can he provide that information soon .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
yes we will do that .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. kattuk .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
so that they can be ready for the arctic winter games in 2002 , we need to be supporting our local teams so that they can compete with other communities and learn new skills .
is there funding put aside in the interim appropriation bill which we voted on this week to pay sport team travel in april of 2000 .
mr. speaker , i know that the minister is very involved in this concern but these games are considered very important by our communities .
although they want to participate they cannot do so unless they come up with their own funding from within their own communities .
at the same time since we are the nunavut government we have to be providing for these organizations .
we should provide some sort of funding to offset their expenditures .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
if you could please keep your preamble short .
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
we are seriously encouraging this assistance and this is under the management of the sport north foundation .
i will be detailing these and making the information available to the house as well as to the gjoa haven soccer team .
also we will inform them whether they can be given the funding before april 17 .
we will try to let them know well in advance in case we might encounter some difficulties or whereby they might have to find alternative funding .
this will relieve some of the pressure so we will ensure that we give this information out well in advance of that date .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. anawak .
oral questions .
mr. irqittuq .
question 343 - 1 ( 3 ) :
allocation of surplus funds
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i think our minister for finance is falling asleep so he has to wake up a bit .
thank you , mr. speaker , my question is directed to the minister of finance regarding regional budget allocation and the details .
first i want to ask him concerning the surplus monies .
did you put together your surplus from all the departments into one pot .
that is my question first .
thank you .
speaker :
minister of finance .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker the surplus is a result of all government expenditures from all government departments .
thank you .
speaker :
oral questions .
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i wonder if the minister can indicate how many different functions they have within the departments .
i wonder if he has details as to the regional budget allocations .
can he indicate to me how much was surplused in the regions .
for example , how much surplus was from sustainable development department how much was surplused from department of health .
i wonder if he can provide that information or does he have the details as to the surplus numbers from each department .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister of finance .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker as i indicated yesterday in answer i believe , to mr. tootoo , i said that we would provide all that information .
it is broken out by departments from what we anticipate the projected surpluses will be .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
oral questions .
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i would really like to see those details in from of me .
i wonder if he can make those available to me .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister of finance .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i said that we would provide them as soon as possible , in fact the staff are probably preparing it as we speak .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
oral questions .
mr. alakannuark .
question 344 - 1 ( 3 ) :
term of decentralized positions
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i am going to address this question to our premier regarding decentralization .
i did not quite understand from my question earlier his response regarding decentralization to the smaller communities .
i understand that there are going to be some positions in repulse bay but how long will these positions be in those communities .
i am wondering about the duration of the jobs because some of the communities are not going to get jobs .
have we considered the smaller communities for decentralization .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
yes , regarding decentralization only some of the communities will actually be getting jobs .
we have already known that all along and this was already in place , they were already planned even before our own government took effect .
this is an on-going review process .
for those communities that we don &apos;t plan to provide decentralized jobs into them we plan to create other opportunities as i have mentioned earlier .
i would really like to pursue this capital project because it will be of benefit to the community residents and that was how i was trying to respond to him .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
oral questions .
mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i understand his response very well and i thank him .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i cannot answer that definitely as to just where the government staff houses will be .
we have to review this once we find out the budget allocation and once the budget is approved in the house then we could probably provide more housing in the communities .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. premier . oral questions .
mr. tootoo .
question 345 - 1 ( 3 ) :
surplus funds for housing
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker my question again is for the minister responsible for the nunavut housing corporation .
mr. speaker , it is my understanding that the supplementary appropriation bill would be approved by the financial management board based on proposals submitted by departments .
i would like to ask the minister responsible for housing if her department prepared any proposals to use any of these surplus funds for housing .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister responsible for housing , ms. thompson .
&#91; ed . note :
minister thompson &apos;s response has been re-interpreted based on the floor recording &#93;
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the nunavut housing corporation was in a complex situation in the beginning because it was been amalgamated from two separate entities .
before that we had no information as to what the surplus numbers would be .
i can tell you that the housing corporation had a very difficult job to do and they had a lot of numbers and figures to work with .
there was a lot of information we had to provide to the committee and this compounded the problem .
i think we all know that should there be any surplus we were planning to try to obtain some of that funding .
as i had stated earlier we were still understaffed .
i can tell you that if there is to be any extra money made available we are going to put in a proposal along with the other departments .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker so if i understand the minister correctly she indicated that the department was too complicated therefore no proposals were prepared .
did she instruct her staff to develop , look at developing , any type of proposal .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i am very proud to be speaking in inuktitut and some times it doesn &apos;t come across as well when it goes through the interpreter .
i didn &apos;t say that it was too complicated .
that &apos;s not what i said in inuktitut , i didn &apos;t say that .
there was a mistake there .
what i said was the housing corporation has been moved to several locations and we just finished the relocation .
they were in community government &amp; transportation for a while , then they went to public works right afterwards , and now it &apos;s a stand-alone organization .
i believe that is quite clear .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker i know that this fiscal year ends this weekend and the surplus is then carried over to the next year &apos;s budget .
that &apos;s my understanding of it mr. speaker .
in her statement mr. speaker , the minister indicated part of the problem for not developing something is she had indicated that she received some inadequate information from the lho &apos;s .
i was wondering if the minister could further elaborate on that .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
i am sorry you did not understand .
i do want to use my own language and i have to use the interpreter .
what i said , i could use an example , in rankin inlet mr. tootoo said that the 1996 figures were too old that were used for the review by the housing corporation .
those were what i was talking about .
we have to update the information and that is going to be a lot of work .
anyway , the task force recommended that we build those houses and we do know that there have to be renovations done on the older units .
i think that &apos;s clear enough and if there are dollars available we will be renovating the older units .
we will be making a request for the surplus dollars to renovate the older units .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker ...
speaker :
final supplementary .
mr. tootoo :
you caught me .
thank you , mr. speaker .
i guess i would just like to get some clarification from the minister .
she has indicated they will be asking or developing a proposal to use surplus funds .
in that case , i &apos;m pretty sure of my understanding that after this weekend there are no more surpluses , they &apos;re already gone .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister responsible for housing , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker what i &apos;m saying is that if there &apos;s any shortage then the housing corporation , we are going to work on that .
we &apos;ve been doing the best we can .
there are many people out there that want to have everything new and everything perfect .
but it is not possible to have everything done all at the same time .
what i &apos;m saying is that if we need further funds i will work on it to get additional funds because that &apos;s my job as the housing minister .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
as i indicated yesterday , i am trying to select the members that haven &apos;t had a question yet or that have only had one question .
so next on the list for oral questions is mr. nutarak .
question 346 - 1 ( 3 ) :
pond inlet arena renovations
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i think that i should ask this question during another item .
it &apos;s for community government &amp; transportation .
i was talking about the arena , which i was concerned about in this house and the minister responsible for that department said that he would meet with me .
my question to the minister is , can i have a meeting with you to talk about the issue i brought up earlier .
speaker :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
yes , we want to get all the appropriate information before we deal with any issues at hand .
the community government employees , i have not had an opportunity to meet with my employees on this issue .
but we will be meeting with the deputy minister possibly today or tomorrow and right after that meeting and once i have the relevant information i will let you know .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. anawak .
oral questions .
mr. akesuk .
question 347 - 1 ( 3 ) :
adequacy of fire trucks in communities
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is directed to the minister of community government &amp; transportation .
some of the communities have fire trucks and one of our communities had a concern in regards to a fire truck .
three of us regular members went down i would like to ask the minister if we do have adequate fire truck services in all the communities that can keep up to the emergency standards .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
there are two types , i believe you are talking about the fire trucks and then there &apos;s the extinguishers that have the same name in inuktitut .
if you are talking about fire trucks we want them in top maintenance so that they will be readily available should there be a fire .
you could let our department know or let us know which community &apos;s fire trucks need servicing or needs to meet the standards .
we work very hard to have all equipment in top condition .
of course our dollars are limited , but i can tell the member that we will work hard because it &apos;s a life saving device and if we .. audio unavailable ...
speaker :
mr. irqittuq .
question 348 - 1 ( 3 ) :
staff housing in decentralized communities
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i would like to direct my question to the minister of finance and administration , mr. ng .
this issue is in regards to decentralization .
the staff housing that will be built , are all of them completed now .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
minister .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , there are office buildings and there is housing .
thank you .
speaker :
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
do the number of units built match the number of employees that are going to the communities .
speaker :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i don &apos;t think when the nunavut implementation commission made their recommendations and the program undertaken to provide staff with office buildings was fully co-ordinated in respect of total numbers .
as a result of that , not everything matches perfectly in respect of office space and housing to the employees .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
question period is up .
i will ask the members if they would wish to take a fifteen-minute break .
we do have some technical problems that have to be addressed and if we can break for fifteen minutes , hopefully they will be repaired or replaced by the time we return .

mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
where are you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
second to last . 240 thousand .
we said that these were unexpended .
i guess a better way to say it is that they were not approved .
those are the ones that we are dealing with at this point .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
i was not quite finished yet .
the 260 thousand you said was not approved .
underneath there is 100 thousand down at the bottom .
there are three of them .
there is 57 thousand , 97 thousand and 100 thousand down at the bottom .
is that part of the 260 thousand .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i apologize that is different .
you are talking about something totally different .
it &apos;s page 6 .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
number 3 , when i look at page 6 , i believe that is what we are talking about here .
it is 260 thousand , up at the top i guess it wasn &apos;t approved .
we agreed to that and right underneath there is 247 thousand , which was not approved .
down at the bottom there are three different numbers .
in my inuktitut anyway , if you are reading the inuktitut .
the top is 260 thousand and you said that it would be used for described positions and then there is the 100 thousand that would be used for these purposes .
my question is , is that part of the 260 thousand .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
that was my mistake .
i believe the minister can respond if you would like .

any further comments .
mr. barnabas .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i seem to have an elastic that keeps putting my hand up .
so maybe i got old copies .
maybe i made inappropriate changes or maybe the names were changed .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
there are differences between the english and inuktitut .
minister of finance , which ones are accurate .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , it is kugluktuk , just to clarify that .
if there is an error in the inuktitut and it says cambridge bay , i apologize for that error . the english version is correct .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister ng .
i realize now that it is going to kugluktuk , but the inuktitut version will have to be corrected so that we will have current information in the inuktitut syllabics .
so it will be correct in both english and inuktitut .
minister of finance .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , for the record i am correcting it here .
for the record it is kugluktuk .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister .
are there any other comments .
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
the hamlet council in that community had been paying to correct the problem at the water reservoir .
mr. chairman , i know that it is very important , the problem is a serious problem , and the water pipes will have to be fixed also .
in the plans here i do not see any plans or funds allotted for the gjoa haven water reservoir and water pipes .
do you have any funds set aside for that purpose .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
mr. minister , if you would like to respond .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , there are no funds for gjoa haven or any other project in this supplementary appropriation .
it is my understanding that the gjoa haven situation with their water supply was remedied .
having said that , there is still the upcoming current fiscal year to deal with any ongoing problem and more permanent arrangements for that situation .
thank you mr. chairman .
the minister of community government &amp; transportation may have something he may want to add to that .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister .

i just have to make a few brief comments and i have a few brief questions .
the transfer of funding of 97 thousand capital appropriations to provide a contribution to the town of iqaluit for a comprehensive solid waste management study .
there is no secret that this community has a solid waste problem .
my question on this is , how much did the town contribute to this study , if anything .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. mclean .
either one of the ministers can respond .
perhaps the minister of finance , go ahead .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
i don &apos;t have that information with me .
i am not sure if the minister of community government has that .
i can find out and report on that mr. chairman .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister of finance .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na itsivauta . on that .
a tax-based community raises taxes through property taxes and other such taxes .
what is going to be the total cost of this solid waste management study when all is said and done .
so what is this study going to cost and is this going to be the end of this study or is this going to be a long-term plan .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. mclean .

mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
in here it states that they are together 360 thousand to provide emergency replacement of the frozen water main in kugluktuk .
is it true that this 100 thousand is to be combined .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. barnabas .
mr. finance minister .
hon. kelvin ng :
yes , mr. chairman , that is correct .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
this 360 thousand says iqaluktutsiaq , but what does it say in english .
the inuktitut says iqaluktutsiaq .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
in english and in inuktitut versions they are not the same .
it is not the same community any more .
could you elaborate on that , mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
the frozen water main is in kugluktuk .
we did not have any work done on frozen water mains in iqaluktutsiaq , cambridge bay .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. anawak .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
finance minister could you verbally say kugluktuk again .
hon. kelvin ng :
he must like the way i say kugluktuk .
i said that , yes mr. chairman , that is correct .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister of finance .
i just want everyone to be aware that although he stated it for the record , in the translations it needs corrections and we need to have a correction in our inuktitut version .
i want everybody to be aware of that .
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
perhaps i can make a motion to clarify this matter so that the english and the inuktitut can correlate together because they are not the same .
so i would like to make a motion , perhaps change the name or move the kugluktuk fund to uqsuqtuq , gjoa haven .
re-profile the funds .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. barnabas .
minister of finance .
hon. kelvin ng :
well , thank you mr. chairman .
i don &apos;t think this is a laughing matter quite frankly .
i take offence at the member &apos;s comments .
this is a serious exercise that we are undergoing here .
the water mains froze up in the community of kugluktuk .
the money has been appropriated to repair it and now we are asking for approval to have that take place .
i don &apos;t think it is a joking matter .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you finance minister .
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas :
thank you mr. chairman .

ministers &apos; statements
minister &apos;s statement 94 - 1 ( 3 ) :
review of nunavut &apos;s first year
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
we are on the eve of our first anniversary as a government and i welcome this opportunity to share with you the progress we have been making .
i am very pleased to say that interest in nunavut has not waned since april 1 last year .
i am happy to say as the world watches us we are still very much in the lime light in our new government .
in fact in many ways , interest in nunavut has grown since last year , and it continues to grow , having a positive impact on key sectors of our economy such as tourism .
i think we can all appreciate when one area of the economy is experiencing success there is also spin off to other sectors .
during the past year there has been numerous and varied visitors to our territory .
i believe we were all pleased yesterday to have welcomed her excellency the right honourable adrienne clarkson and her husband his excellency john ralston saul to the assembly .
last fall the right honourable jean chretien accompanied by his excellency the president of the republic of france jacque chirac .
they honoured us with their company .
last week also the speaker of the manitoba legislative assembly our fellow inuk george hickes was welcomed in this chamber .
we have had shinto priests this summer visiting from japan , as well as visits from the israeli consul general .
the australian minister of aboriginal affairs was also here and the honourable jonathan motzfeldt premier of greenland .
and once again , the media from around the world are in nunavut to tell our story on this our first anniversary .
this exposure for the most part has been very positive on nunavut and it continues to raise our profile nationally and internationally .
as each member of this assembly can attest it has been a busy year .
during the past twelve months our government has been diligently involved in building the territory envisioned by nunavummiut .
we have asked their opinions and they have answered whole heartily .
we welcome this feedback as this is their government .
as a new territory we need strong allies .
we have begun a strong relationship with greenland , our closest international neighbour .
as i mentioned earlier , we need to recognise that we need strong allies as we build a stronger nunavut .
we have signed an agreement with manitoba our largest trading partner to work together for the benefit of both our jurisdictions .
we have met with our territorial counterparts in the west from the yukon and the northwest territories to form a northern leaders forum in part to strengthen our position on issues of common interest .
through this relationships our voice will grow ever stronger as we stand to claim our share as member of the canadian federation .
we have been very busy outside our boarders .
we have been even busier inside them .
despite the challenges we face we made a smooth transition from the former government - truly a remarkable accomplishment and one that reflects highly with the staff we have .
we established a decentralization secretariat . a reflection of our commitment to decentralise government so nunavummiut benefit from employment and economic opportunity across nunavut .
after listening to the priorities of nunavut we developed the bathurst mandate which will guide us in our work .
( interpretation ) through maligarnik qimirqujiit we have begun reviewing the laws we inherited from the former government to ensure that they reflect values and needs of nunavummiut .
we launched the visual identity program which became the symbol that identifies nunavut within canada and throughout the world while at the same time promoting the talent and vision of our artists .
as our territory continues to grow , we want to ensure the businesses are able to take advantages of nunavut &apos;s growth and development .
( interpretation ends ) the government of nunavut is proceeding with its work and will continue to be guided in the decision making by the bathurst mandate .
there were exciting initiatives announced by my colleague the honourable kelvin ng in his past budget address before the assembly last week .
these initiatives will have our communities grow strong .
our government is committed to moving towards healthy communities and simplicity and unity in government , self-reliance for nunavummiut and continued learning .
we hope to provide infrastructure and human resource to allow each and everyone to reach his or her potential .
( interpretation ) april 1 , 1999 wasn &apos;t the end of a dream .
it was the beginning of a new dream a new journey and new challenge .
many thought nunavut was unachievable ;
we proved them wrong .
( interpretation ends ) we should always remember though through their diligence and with so much commitment through many years leading to the creation of nunavut .
without their vision and dedication we would not have been able to achieve what we have .
our hopes and desire for nunavut are also not a dream :
they are achievable .
we want a nunavut ;
where people can achieve their potential ,
where strong links exist between communities and southern canada , where health and social conditions are equal to those enjoyed by other canadians ,
where equal opportunities exists for everyone ,
where nunavut enjoys growing prosperity while remaining debt free .
( interpretation ) these are some of the goals for the future .
they are realistic and they are achievable .
we are building a stronger nunavut and i welcome everyone who wants to grab hold and be a part of our journey for our future . thank you mr. speaker .

appreciation to interpreters
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
merci , nakurmik , qujarnamii , ma &apos;na , donka , gracias , arigato .
mr. speaker i would like today to talk about language in this house and the wonderful work our interpreters and our translators do .
mr. speaker , this legislative assembly is about one of three canadian legislatures that works with more than one language on a daily basis .
this in itself is a reflection of the uniqueness of nunavut as a whole .
when we are in session five days a week , 6 plus hours a day our interpreters work tremendously hard to ensure all honourable members understand one another
even if we do not always agree with each other , mr. speaker , the right of members to use the language of their choice is fundamental .
to enjoy this right the professionalism and dedication of our interpreters are invaluable .
mr. speaker , all members of this house care passionately about the issues affecting their communities .
that is why debate gets so heated .
this is not a bad thing .
mr. speaker it is not appropriate for any member to dismiss differences of opinion or difficult issues blaming miscommunication or lack of understanding .
the issues we deal with are complex , challenging and require patience .
it is the responsibility of each and everyone to choose our words well to ensure we are making the best effort possible to make ourselves understood .
that is our responsibility .
thank you mr. speaker .

nunavut &apos;s first anniversary
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i rise today with great pleasure to make my statement in the company of my fellow members to mark the first anniversary of the nunavut government tomorrow .
it is evident that the inuit are governing themselves now and making the decisions for the people .
the decisions that we make today are going to have an impact on our children and our future generations .
i consider myself very privileged to be a part of this process .
at times there will be challenges but that should never discourage us .
that is the only way we can keep things going .
i would like to thank this opportunity to thank our staff who have been working very hard to make this a reality .
i would like to especially to take this opportunity to thank the people who have worked very hard in creating the nunavut government .
in particular john amagoalik and paul quassa .
i know there are other people involved but i can not name them all right now .

evangelists visit to taloyoak
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker i rise today to speak about taloyoak in my riding of nattilik .
yesterday they had some evangelists visit the community .
the visitors chartered in their own plane and i understand they will be there for another day .
mr. speaker there are different organizations that promote community well being .
when they come to our communities we welcome them even if we do not participate in the actual event .
i expect that they will add to a sense of community well being .
in our past , our ancestors did not practise organized religion within nunavut .
although this is not part of our traditional culture , it is common now to accept christianity within our communities .
it a very useful belief system because they help us to deal with our hard times .
we can discuss things that are heavy for us through our faith .
we should always encourage evangelists to visit our communities .
i hope our nunavut government will encourage visitors such as these . thank you mr. speaker .

when we had our negotiations it seemed that it was a long time ago but it was not too long ago .
we were able to get some funding from the federal government at the time when hugh faulkner was the minister to get some funding for negotiations .
like hugh faulkner when i saw him on tv. he has changed greatly although i do not seem to have changed as much as him .
i remember years ago when i first started to go to school we were asked to talk in english all the time , not in inuktitut .
we could not take the inuktitut curriculum because we were not allowed to .

we wanted to have the terms of reference fine-tuned so that we will not just be looking at broad issues and not come up with just anything , we wanted to do specific things .
for example , we need to look at long-term solutions especially in this situation in iqaluit .
i have asked my staff to provide a report with options and recommendations to meet specific day-care needs in iqaluit .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you minister .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker i can echo the minister &apos;s concerns or comments that it is this whole issue of day-cares is something that is an issue not only here in iqaluit but all over nunavut .
mr. speaker by conducting this review and the minister &apos;s comments , is the minister indicating that his department has a responsibility to ensure that we have adequate day-care facilities and that in nunavut .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister for education .
hon. james arvaluk :
mr. speaker we did not have direct responsibility for the adequacy of the day-care centres .
we have responsibility to contribute budgets and help as much as we can in terms of financial assistance subsidy programs for day-care centres and yes we recognize that .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you minister .
supplementary mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker given the minister &apos;s response that his department does have a role to play in the day-care system in ways of funding that he had indicated .
so , i &apos;m wondering if i can get some clarification on that .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
certainly mr. speaker , i would love to clarify that .
the day care programs across nunavut and across canada do their own fundraising .
they get fundraising from the companies .
they do bingoes and other fundraising programs and the government through their limited resources for day-care programs also participate in subsidising or assisting financially .
they are independently run by the non-profit organizations and some groups for profit , some through the head start programs .
the department doesn &apos;t actually hire the managers the workers or in fact handle the up-keep of the buildings .
that is what i was trying to explain to the media .
thank you .
speaker :
oral questions . mr. barnabas .
question 350 - 1 ( 3 ) :
inuit events at awg
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
so , i would like to direct my question to the minister of community government .
mr. anawak would you give me accurate information as to what the status is on that thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
yes we were very proud to represent nunavut in whitehorse in the yukon .
i think our fans were some of the loudest and this was a very proud day for all us nunavummiut .
in regards to the upcoming winter games that will be held in the year 2002 , yes we will be co-hosting with nuuk , greenland .
well we have not debated about this issue and the discussions are ongoing at this time and a meeting with the greenland delegation .
we have not quite decided which country the inuit games will be held in .
however , we nunavummiut have stated that both countries should share inuit games .
some inuit games should be held in iqaluit and some in nuuk so that we can cover both countries when it comes to inuit games .
i think we can deal with this issue rapidly and all we have to do now is decide what kind of arrangements we will have for arctic winter games .
thank you , mr. speaker .

question 351 - 1 ( 3 ) :
update on elder patients
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
yesterday i raised an urgent matter .
up to today i still have not received a response , so i will redirect my question to the premier to see if he can update my question thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
would the member clarify the question so the premier knows what your are referring to .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i am sorry i did not mention what i was going to ask about .
there were two people , one from qikiqtarjuaq and one from clyde river , that have gone to the hospital for medical reasons .
i was asking a question about that and indicated that i would like to receive a response today because this is an urgent matter .
thank you , mr. speaker .

speaker :
thank you mr. premier for that brief answer .
oral questions .
mr. puqiqnak .
question 352 - 1 ( 3 ) :
gjoa haven day care centre
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is directed to the minister of public works .
in my riding they have been requesting a day care centre , but all the buildings that are being utilised are in gjoa haven .
i wanted to get some information yesterday during my member &apos;s statements in rankin inlet during our last session there .
i had raised this question to the minister to see what kind of arrangements they will have with our buildings in gjoa haven .
when i talked to the minister about it , she was telling me that they were making progress on it and going through blue prints for the design of the building .
so , i would like to direct my question to the minister of public works to see if she would give me a copy of the blueprints that she was talking about .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i am not sure if the new government was dealing with day care centre .
i will want to get a clarification on that .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the previous government had worked on the blueprints and the design of the day care centre in gjoa haven .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
ms thompson .
hon. manitok thompson :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i appreciate the work of the day care providers because they are doing a very good job taking care of these young people .
so , i will look in to find out if i can produce a blue print for the member and give him a copy of it if i can find one .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
oral questions mr. tootoo .
question 353 - 1 ( 3 ) :
day-care funding
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr speaker my question is to the minister responsible for education .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister responsible for education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i think the member will appreciate that during the committee of the whole . there is only so much that can go around from the government budget .
however , this is a budget program proposal it is not final and this is our proposal to date .
for example , the member will appreciate that the capital expenditure estimates for the schools have more than doubled .
so , it is not that the day care is not important , it is very important , but there is only so much money going around .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
just a reminder that the budget is in the committee of the whole and you should try to keep your questions for that period .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i understand that and i probably will be raising the same questions in the committee of the whole .
mr. speaker , the minister said that the difference is 31 thousand dollars .
mr. speaker , i would imagine that is a significant amount of money for a day-care . that could mean a day care remaining open or closing .
so , i would beg to differ that it is insignificant .
that is a significant amount , any dollar a day-care loses , because many of them are struggling to keep their doors open .
some of them have to send kids home because they do not have the staff or the space .
so i would beg to differ from the minister because 30 thousand dollars is a significant amount and that could mean the difference between a day care staying open or closing .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
mr. speaker : i think this i an unfair question because the why part is going to be very long .
when we allocate funding for different divisions and programs in the department of education , we have only so much and we try to juggle all we can .
there are some reductions in some programs in other areas in education .
yes the day care program is a 30 thousand dollar victim .
i will have this report made available to the member and after that we can start discussing as to what we can do for the day-care .
i am completely open for suggestions for day-care , but there is only so much money that can go around at this time until that report recommends otherwise .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you minister .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. minister .
hon. james arvaluk :
amongst other things , yes , other things we are also looking at for day-care programs . are they being run effectively .
are the buildings sufficient .
can we look at other ways of running the day-cares .
how much responsibility does the department of education have .
should there be a drive from the department looking at other organizations and institutions to participate in the day-care program , perhaps more than they have been to date .
these are the things that we want to find out so we can eliminate problems that we have been facing with day-care .
speaker :
thank you minister .
final supplementary . mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i look forward to that report and seeing it .
the minister can correct me if i &apos;m wrong , that has been inherited from the gnwt &apos;s department of education .
will the department be looking at that formula and seeing the higher costs of living , goods and services in nunavut are taken into account .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. minister .
hon. james arvaluk :
yes mr. speaker .
speaker :
oral questions , mr. irqittuq .
question 354 - 1 ( 3 ) :
igloolik decentralization funding mr. irqittuq :
( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker perhaps this question is to the minister of finance .
during our oral question period , i think it was yesterday and a year ago about the decentralization of jobs to igloolik .
i just wanted to find out how much of that money that was allocated for decentralization to igloolik has decreased .
speaker :
minister responsible for finance and administration .
hon. kelvin ng :
none of the money has been decreased , to answer the member &apos;s question .
speaker :
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i think there was going to be seventy-two and one half positions , but i think there has only been seventeen positions looked at .
so how many more positions have been eliminated .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister for finance .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you minister .
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , the letter that he is talking about i received yesterday .
the question that i asked him was how many more positions have been eliminated . i think there are only sixty-eight positions .
i think there were two more that have been eliminated from the seventeen positions .
the four positions that were eliminated , where are they going to be allocated to .
speaker :
minister responsible for human resources , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , again in reference to the update that the premier provided , there have been no positions changed since that up-date .
as you know , the premier has taken responsibility for co-ordination of decentralization on behalf of all government .
he recognizes the importance of it to all members and government .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i am grateful for the decentralisation of positions to the communities . there were seventy-two and one half originally , now there are only seventy left for decentralization .
when i looked at the letter there are only sixty-eight positions to be decentralized .
speaker :
mr. minister .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i think that the premier will in writing continue to update the members on the status of decentralisation in this house as we move forward in staffing up the positions .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
oral questions .
mr. akesuk .
question 355 - 1 ( 3 ) :
review of time change
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker first i would like to welcome my family .
my question is directed to the government leader .
last fall there was a bill introduced that members did not like very much and it has to do with the time change .
during that time the premier stated they would look into the time change just to see whether the government would have it changed again .
the question i have is whether that has been looked at or not .
speaker :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the department of justice has that under review at this time .
what you have to realize is we have one time zone in nunavut region and there were many people that find it is better to have one time zone for the area .
we appreciate the baffin region experienced a two hour change but it was because the change to nunavut time and the daylight savings time change happened at the same time .
in the spring it falls back and another time change is going to be happening soon again .
we can look at that but the actual change is only one hour .
we see people are quite happy with the time change and that it was made for nunavummiut .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question , i believe was not answered .
speaker :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
yes i just indicated that we will be moving our clocks tomorrow .
as to how we can look at this again , when we changed the time zone in the baffin region the whole nunavut area fell back an hour .
therefore , we adjusted that by an hour so that everybody could have the same time zone .
we decided that we would be in the same time zone as the central time zone .
for those of us in the department of justice we did not get a feeling that this was not good for the people .
maybe once we move our clocks ahead another hour we should decide whether to change back to the original time zones since in saskatchewan they do not change .
they stay consistent .
these are one of the things we can try to find out .
thank you .
speaker :
oral questions .
mr. iqaqrialu .
question 356 - 1 ( 3 ) :
funding for smaller communities
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
concerning decentralization , my question will be directed to the premier and the minister of sustainable development .
it very good that communities will be getting decentralized jobs .
there have been a number of answers to these types of questions .
my question in particular relates to this .
many of the smaller communities are you going to give funding to those communities only if they put in proposals .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
hon. peter kilabuk . minister of sustainable development .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
in response to his question i can say that this was raised previously in the house in his question asking if we are going to be giving funding according to proposals that we receive .
a number of communities have prepared plans as to what economic endeavours they wish to pursue .
this member is asking me if his community would have to propose a request for funding .
yes , according to the wish of the community , we would set aside funding for community initiatives and we want to make these plans more concrete with the community members .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i very much like the response that the minister has provided me .
but there are smaller communities that have not prepared proposals for funding .
for those communities that do not have proposals .
where can they go and get assistance in filling out proposals for funding .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
hon. peter kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
the department of sustainable development should be understood to him that we will be always available to the smaller communities as well as bigger communities to help prepare proposals for funding requests .
our staff members at sustainable development will always help and aid filling out applications .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
when the smaller communities do not have any proposals for submissions does that mean they will not receive any type of funding .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
hon. peter kilabuk
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
yes , just for an example say for instance if they had made a long term plan and they want to continue these initiatives then it would continue .
i know some of the communities do not have five year plans or long term plans .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. barnabas .
question 357 - 1 ( 3 ) :
unused decentralization buildings
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question is directed to the minister of intergovernmental affairs .
mr. okalik .
my question mr. speaker , is concerning the decentralized communities .
what will happen to those houses and offices that are not being used right now within those decentralized communities .
like for example in igloolik they were going to put in 75 fte so housing has to be there for those positions as well .
it has now been reduced to 68 full time positions .
what will happen to remaining office spaces and the houses that were built in those communities .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. okalik .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
yes , i can respond to that question .
some of the houses began to be used by employees and some of them are not quite done yet .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. barnabas .
supplementary .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
the decentralised jobs have been relocated to different communities and i was talking about the office spaces and the housing in those communities .
for the communities that got more decentralized jobs do they plan on putting more housing and more office space in those communities .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. okalik .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i do not quite understand the question .
if he could repeat his question .
thank you .
speaker :
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas :
yes , thank you mr. speaker .
some of these decentralized government positions were moved from one community to another community and from my understanding , ncc built these offices units so that decentralised positions can be matched .
i noticed that some of these positions have been moved to another decentralised community without office space and units .
are they going to build units for positions that are moved from one community to another .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
premier .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the plans put together by ncc did not totally reflect the number of jobs that had been planned for communities .
some of the office spaces are ready , but the offices still do not have furniture in some cases and we will have to wait for sealift in some cases .
so all the jobs there were identified for these communities the number of positions have largely been met through our decentralisation plans .
a few minor adjustments have been made for a number of jobs that were slated for each community .
i believe we have done quite well in meeting the expectations of the communities and we will continue to implement the decentralisation plan .
i will be available for any questions on this matter .
qujannami .
speaker :
thank you premier .
supplementary . mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :

now i understand his response for the minister of decentralisation .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. barnabas .
mr. okalik .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you , mr. speaker .
yes , the places are being opened .
there is no furniture in these buildings .
there are no telephone lines in those buildings .
there are no computers for office workers to use once they are opened and turned over to our government .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. okalik .
oral questions .
mr. iqaqrialu .
question 358 - 1 ( 3 ) :
infrastructure for decentralized positions
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i would like more information to this question that was just posed .
also , to the premier how many communities have been completely accommodated for decentralisation .
how many communities have not been accommodated by way of housing and office spaces .
which jobs are ready to be filled .
which jobs are not ready to be filled .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
i believe there is more than one question there .
if the premier would answer whichever question he cares to .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
some of the jobs are being filled on a daily basis .
some of the communities are being filled .
for example in arviat , it was readily prepared and some of the communities have office spaces but they have no furniture or computers .
some of these jobs will be transferred to the communities from iqaluit and some of the jobs still have to be advertised .
so , i cannot say just when they will be filled .
if you notice in the papers we are always seeking people to fill those positions in the communities .
this has always been our plan all along .
we want to get this done in three years and this is one of our main goals .
this will be our priority .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i believe the response you made and i appreciate it .
i want to ask you one more thing .
the houses that are made by ncc i know they are being used right now and they have to be paid monthly and they are very costly .
now i am wondering do they have to pay for their rent out of their own pocket money or do they get subsidised housing allowances to offset their monthly rent charges .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. okalik .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
the jobs that will be filled in the communities they will be getting a form of assistance for their housing but they will also be paying from their salaries as well .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. premier .
should mention that the sound system we have here will be removed and go back to the new system at the beginning of the week .
oral questions .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
supplementary to my question .
i really envy employees working for the government of nunavut .
they will be getting subsidised housing to offset their rent .
i wondering how much housing allowance will be provided to the civil servants for their housing .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. okalik
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
is he asking how much housing allowance we are going to provide .
they are the same as every other civil servant that we give assistance to where ever they may be in the communities .
so , we will just follow the standard allowance .
staff in iqaluit receive allowances and we will be providing the same allowance for those in the community .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
final supplementary mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i want to be well informed about this . maybe he can give me written information to that affect .
can he provide me written documentation about the housing allowances .
that would make me very happy .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. okalik .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i am not sure exactly which ones he is referring to because we provide the same allowance to all the communities and they also receive a northern allowance .
we help our employees with that and all our employees within nunavut receive this which have a provision from the employer .
i am not sure to which he is referring to .
maybe if he can indicate to me which one he is referring to mr. speaker .
speaker :
i am not sure if that was the final supplementary but i will indulge the member to ask his final supplementary .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
that was supposed to be my final supplementary but i would like to receive some written documents so i can have accurate information .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
premier okalik .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
we have a northern subsidy , we have a northern allowance .
we can make these available to the public .

question 359 - 1 ( 3 ) :
status of student financial assistance program
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question will be directed to the minister of finance .
( interpretation ends ) i would like the minister to state to the house the status of the student financial assistance program .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister responsible of education .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk thank you mr. speaker .
we have a two year contract with gnwt for the student financial assistance .
this is going to be a part of the income support review that we hope to table a report on this fall .
in the meantime we still have a contract to honour with the gnwt until the second year .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i am aware there is a review underway but does he expect an increase with the student financial assistance .
mr. speaker the reason being the student financial assistance student rates have been the same over the last four years .
i recall asking questions on this issue .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
you can see the time is up .
i will allow the minister to respond to the question .
if the member has any further supplementaries we will permit him to proceed .
mr. minister .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
why would i want to carry out a review and be not regard the results of that review .
that is why i want to do a proper review done independently so that we can decide on the recommendations as to whether there will be an increase or a decrease .
i do not want to respond to that before i see the results of the review and once i see the recommendations i will see if i can follow them through .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
time is up .

good morning .
midway during lunch hour , we had a short snack there but before we get into committee of the whole , we will have a 5 minute break and come back to the house .
thank you .
&gt; &gt; committee recessed for 5 minutes
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i think we can get back to our meeting of the whole .
we have the minister of education with his opening remarks , minister arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairperson , in the fall of 1999 the government of nunavut spent considerable time travelling across nunavut speaking with residents and programs and services that were of importance to them .
during those consultations , education issues were raised in 24 of the 25 communities visited .
some of the concerns that were heard focussed on more new schools , reducing overcrowding in the classrooms and more inuktitut in the schools and cultural and traditional programs in the schools .
i believe that we have addressed these concerns in our departmental planning for the coming year .
i will give examples later in my comments .
( interpretation ends ) the plan speaks to the four building blocks that will help us to frame those activities that we will be undertaking ;
healthy communities , self-reliance , simplicity , unity and learning .
departments were asked to frame their future activities along these lines .
my department has done this and our activities are consistent with the bathurst mandate .
the minister of finance mentioned several new initiatives that my department will be undertaking this year .
i would like to provide more detail to the members on those activities .
we will be investing $ 400,000.00 dollars in the development of inuktitut curriculum instructional support and approved development curriculum for inuit 1st and 2nd languages needed to be developed .
the development implementation of these curricula will be a first priority .
in addition , appropriate student and teacher resource material will be developed to support the new curricula .
curriculum and material development and production is critical to the department &apos;s commitment to deliver quality education to meet the needs of nunavut students .
we will also be investing an additional 1.2 million dollars and new teaching positions and resources to schools to address increasing enrolments .
this will help address the growing number of students in our schools and provide some relief to our school system by maintaining the pupil / teacher ratio .
again , this is a direct reference to what we heard in the communities .
during the next fiscal year , the department of education will be taking active steps to reduce dependency on income support .
using existing program resources , we will be instituting a case management system to oversee the delivery of this program .
the initial step will be additional training for income support workers building greater community capacity through community management and ensuring program compliance .
these initial steps will strengthen the department &apos;s ability to build self-sufficiency , strength in our communities while reducing our expenditure within the program .
mr. chairman we have had some successes in the area in iqaluit .
the department assumes responsibility for the delivery of income support in october 1999 we have seen a drop in our caseload and expenditure each month .
this is a result of better compliance measures and individuals finding success through productive choices and better linkage to adult learning and training .
building healthy communities and ensuring self-reliance of nunavummiut is a priority and we are building upon the budget consultation process .
we have initiated the income support policy review consultation process to ensure we built on the ideas and aspirations of nunavummiut .
throughout the pre-budget consultation sessions , communities told us our schools needed work .
in the coming year we will be overseeing 15 new and on-going capital projects .
the total capital dollars for the department of education for 2000-2001 is 15.3 million dollars .
more than double our regional capital plans for 1999-2000 .
the construction of the cambridge bay high school will start this summer .
the cost of this project will substantially be covered by insurance payments , also , the elementary school addition to be completed .
we will begin the planning process for the new schools in baker lake as well as planning and designing for library re-location .
pond inlet will see the initiation of project to renovate the elementary school and examine the high school gym options .
clyde river will see the start of the planning process to address the difficulties for the existing school .
we will in partnership with the federal government begin construction of new french first language school in iqaluit .
igloolik will see a completion of this school addition project , funds have been allocated for the final warranty phase of the school addition in repulse bay .
kugluktuk school interior renovations are now complete and exterior upgrade is planned to insure longevity .
pelly bay school addition and construction will begin following the summer arrival of the building &apos;s supplies .
mr. chairperson , the department of education will also start a series of minor capital projects in many of our schools .
we will finance these minor capital projects through the anticipated surplus following the dissolution of three education councils .

joint minister &apos;s of energy and environment meeting
hon. peter kilabuk :
thank you , mr. speaker .
as members know , i participated in the joint ministers of energy and the environment in vancouver .
these meetings are normally rare events but of late one topic has created the need for energy and environment ministers to meet once a year .
the topic is climate change .
climate change is not a unique problem to canada and indeed only 2 percent of the world &apos;s gas emissions originate in canada and nunavut only emits 0.1 percent of these emissions .
however , while canadians are only a small contributor to the problems , we are a huge recipient of its impact .
today these impacts are occurring more quickly and in greater concentration in canada &apos;s north .
for this reason mr. speaker , it is extremely important to bring the north &apos;s point of view to the table of the energy and environments ministers .
as the environment minister for nunavut , i feel it is extremely important to nunavummiut to improve our knowledge on climate change .
to that end mr. speaker , i urged my colleagues attending the jmm to adapt a more aggressive program of science on the impact of climate change .
i invited scientists from environment canada to nunavut to provide members with detailed information on what is known and what is not known about climate change .
i have also asked my department officials to begin work on a climate change plan for nunavut to be presented to cabinet and this house at a later date .
mr. speaker together with canada &apos;s two other territories , the yukon and the northwest territories ;
we have an important voice at the national level on the climate change issue .
a voice that did not go unnoticed at the meetings .
the measures that must be taken to protect our environment and the livelihoods of nunavummiut for future generations .
thank you , mr. speaker .

fpt ministers of health meeting
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker i want to inform you of a meeting of federal , provincial and territorial health ministers , which i recently attended in ontario .
mr. speaker this was a very important meeting for the preservation of our national health care system .
as you know mr. speaker , nunavut is not alone in this country in our struggle to maintain the quality of our health care systems for our people .
the budgets for health are being stretched near the breaking point across canada and although are needs in nunavut are unique , our goals are the same as other jurisdictions .
mainly to preserve our ability to provide high quality , accessible health care to our citizens .
mr. speaker i have joined my provincial and territorial colleagues to demand the federal government increase their contribution to health care across canada including nunavut .
mr. speaker we want the canadian government to restore the canadian health and social transfer or chst to 1994 / 95 levels adjusted to reflect current economic reality .
mr. speaker we want the federal government to reaffirm there fiscal commitment to the canada health act .
mr. speaker , we feel that we have made progress in getting the support of the federal minister of health , the honourable allan rock .
we have also undertaken top brief all premiers and to continue to pursue these discussions .
mr. speaker , i will continue to advise this house as the issue develops .
thank you , mr. speaker .

members &apos; statements
member &apos;s statement 253 - 1 ( 3 ) :
homeowners expenses
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i rise today to bring to the attention of this house a problem that is facing my constituency , in quttiktuq .
mr. speaker , in the past the government had established programs to help lower income residents to purchase their own home .
a goal , i am sure that we all support .
but mr. speaker , many of these people are experiencing difficulties in paying for fuel to heat these same homes .
mr. speaker , the increase in the price of fuel hurts everyone .
it is hurting my constituencies .
my communities are among the coldest of all of nunavut and fuel prices the highest .
the increase in the cost of fuel means simply these vulnerable families now have less money to pay for food , clothing and other necessities .
mr. speaker , i urge the government to take action so that people are not faced with the prospect of staying warm or going hungry .
thank you , mr. speaker .

kitikmeot information technology
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
through kitikmeot polar net technologies or polar net for short , has been providing and advancing internet services in the kitikmeot .
kitikmeot had a vision in 1996 that information and technology would connect the kitikmeot to the rest of nunavut , canada and the world .
they believed that the internet would provide a way for a small region with a small population to acquire and share knowledge and information and have a big voice .
mr. speaker , the benefits of the internet are numerous .
it can provide economic development opportunities such as selling carvings over the internet or promoting tourism .
i can provide educational opportunities in schools and home users .
it can also provide communications among communities because it is much faster than faxing or telephone and costs less .
mr. speaker i would like to receive unanimous consent to conclude his statements .
speaker :
the member is seeking unanimous consent to conclude his statements .
any nays .
proceed mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the internet offers training and employment opportunities to young people in the technology field .
further more mr. speaker , all of the polar net employees are inuit youth who are fully trained to look after expensive high tech equipment , and to manage the business .
even more remarkably , mr. speaker through our system visitors to the kitikmeot can access their e-mail locally without incurring expensive long distance charges .
it is very convenient and their system also works with kitikmeot residents when they are travelling and trying to stay in touch with families and businesses .
lastly mr. speaker , kitikmeot corporation has made a significant capital investment in the high tech equipment and training their employees to establish polar net .
they realise that this is an essential service in the kitikmeot .
thank you , mr. speaker .

suicide prevention workshop
hon. donald havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
this past weekend has marked the first anniversary of nunavut &apos;s creation .
although we celebrate one year of our new territory and government , we cannot forget that our communities continue to lose people to the scourge of suicide at a terrifying rate .
( interpretation ends ) mr. speaker , we need to discuss this topic and talk amongst ourselves .
it is a difficult situation to deal with in the communities but as we begin to discuss this with each other within our communities and families .
kugluktuk is pushing to heal after the recent death of two members of the community .
the community gathered to find the strength to heal itself .
at a recent workshop in kugluktuk the workshop demonstrates the value of dialogue .
the workshop was facilitated by caroline anawak , an individual who we are all privileged to know .
the people of kugluktuk want to express their appreciation to caroline and her support in helping communities like mine in facing this issue head on .
many people from across the kitikmeot were able to attend the workshop to represent from gjoa haven to taloyoak , pelly bay and cambridge bay .
many people from kugluktuk came to these workshops .
i just want to ask consent to finish my statement .
speaker :
the member is asking consent to continue with his statement .
any nays .
you may continue .
hon. donald havioyak :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker there is a growing awareness that this issue can no longer be put under the carpet .
that we can not simply blame our leaders or the government or blame our institutions .
blame has never solved a single problem and it will not solve this one .
we must be aware that the nunavut government cannot find solutions right away but will assist to meet in different communities much like the meeting in kugluktuk .
this will become clearer within our communities , families , and here today in nunavut .
thank you , mr. speaker .

david kilabuk and roger allivaqtak were the coaches .
we would have won if we had used joanne evic who was the goalie for the midget team because he can stop any kind of goal .
my son really enjoyed the hockey game last night .
we are proud of you .
i thank that young man juan .
i think there were 10 people staying over the weekend at my house .

full time mayor for iqaluit
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker mr. speaker i would like to congratulate the hockey team from cape dorset on their win yesterday .
mr. akesuk is just too loud of a fan , mr. speaker .
uqaqti over the past two years iqaluit has experienced unprecedented growth in population and new infrastructure .
new office buildings , apartments and houses are very evident .
with this growth comes opportunity and concern ; opportunity with a strong economic base which creates jobs , but concerns over the administrative and logistic details of the growth .
uqaqti i read with great interest the iqaluit town council &apos;s discussions on the creation of a part-time paid position for mayor .
i respectfully ask the position for mayor be made full time with a salary package commensurate with the workload and the responsibilities .
i have had discussion with some of the councillors about this and recently wrote the mayor and council to suggest they formally look at such a proposal .
mr. speaker iqaluit is a diverse community with three major languages and cultures .
the role of a full time mayor would be to work pro-actively with the council as well with administration to help develop and prepare our community to face the 21st century .
the growth iqaluit has experienced will on all accounts continue for the foreseeable future .
the workload and the responsibilities on the mayor of the largest community and the capital of nunavut begs to be filled by a full time mayor position .
mr. speaker a full time paid mayor position is an idea whose time has come .
i look forward to discussing this proposal and further detail with our council and hearing from iqaluit residents about the idea .

thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. barnabas .
mr. picco , minister responsible for health and social services .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
thank you mr. barnabas for welcoming me back into the house .
this is a very important question and topic .
it came up in rankin inlet last month when we were sitting there .
at that time , i confirmed to the house that a review is under way with the department of health and social services to look at the policy that we have for medical travel .
that review is almost complete .
i am hoping to have an opportunity to read it sometime this week or next week .
basically mr. speaker , we have three types of medical travel .
we have travel for emergency medical evacuation , also travel for physician and other health providers to get around to communities .
then we also have the escort travel .
which i think the member is talking about .
thank you mr. speaker .

question 361 - 1 ( 3 ) :
shortage of nurses
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
last week i asked the minister of health some questions and i will be asking for an update .
there is a shortage of nurses in both the small and the large communities and we feel it especially when there is a flu epidemic .
in the two communities that i represent there is a shortage in both of them but especially in qikiqtarjuaq .
therefore , i would like to ask if there is work being done in filling the nurses positions in those communities .
that is my question .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister of health , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , over the past several months as we have explained in this house , there has been a shortage of nurses , not just in nunavut .
mr. speaker , i was just coming from the meeting last week in ontario and every jurisdiction in canada seems to have a problem with nurses and medical professionals .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
oral questions .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i like the answer he gave but he just gave me a bunch of new questions i would like to ask .
did i understand that you have now a search committee or group of people to search for nurses .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
they meet on a regular basis to address recruitment and retention issues for our nursing staff in nunavut .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
yes , i understand the answer .
we have eliminated the health boards that would have been doing this work of recruitment .
will the elimination of the health boards effect the recruitment of nurses .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , partly the member is correct , the responsibility for recruitment and retention did rest before april 1 , with the three regional health boards .
so basically mr. speaker , that is where the program has come from .
the working title is the nayatt working group within the department of health &amp; social services .
mr. speaker , we are moving aggressively as the members know in this house , we actually recruited several nurses from australia for example .
we are continuing with recruiting in the south , mr. speaker , and again , there is no easy solution to the concern that we have with the shortage of nursing staff .
but now mr. speaker , we are doing quite well .
i believe the rate in the baffin is around 80 percent and similar numbers , mr. speaker , in the other two regions right now for our staff .
so that is good news .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
this sounds like interesting information .
we as members need to know as much as possible so perhaps outside this house we could meet with the minister on this .
thank you , mr. speaker .

thank you mr. iqaqrialu .

question 362 - 1 ( 3 ) :
culture , language , elders &amp; youth capital projects
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question is for the minister responsible for the department of culture , language , elders &amp; youth .
i am just wondering if the minister could provide that criteria .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i would be glad to share it with members .
i don &apos;t have it right with me right now physically but i am sure we could provide it as soon as possible .
thank you , mr. speaker .
thank you mr. premier . mr. tootoo .
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question is for the minister responsible for the nunavut housing corporation .
mr. speaker , last spring ...
speaker :
i am sorry mr. tootoo that is a new question for a new minister .
we will have to move to someone else first and you can come back to it later .
mr. akesuk .
question 363 - 1 ( 3 ) :
placement of foster children
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i have a question to the minister of health &amp; social services on the difficult issue of orphans , young children that have lost their parents .
what is the policy or procedures of placing these types of children with family members or for adoptions .
is there a specialist that deals with this or are they just given to social workers .
that is my question .
speaker :
thank you mr. akesuk .
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , each individual circumstance for foster care , i think that is what the member is asking about , is unique and different .
basically mr. speaker , what happens in most cases is that a social worker would be involved and there would be a decision about whether they would need to be placed in foster care .
at that time mr. speaker , there is usually a list of available families where the child can be placed in that care .
indeed , mr. speaker , i think it is safe to assume that the parents are involved in that decision in most cases .
now there may be extenuating circumstances , mr. speaker , where a child is taken from a family and put into foster care .
there may be legal charges , there may be a sudden death and other circumstances .
but in general , mr. speaker , that is how the process works .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , the minister answered only part of my question .
in these types of cases are extended family members consulted on where a child will be placed .
that is my question .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i will try to be a little bit clearer .
so it depends on the circumstances .
in general mr. speaker , in most cases that i have been aware of mr. speaker , indeed , the parents are consulted and indeed , the family members are consulted .
social services just doesn &apos;t go in and take a child from a family and then put them somewhere .
that would be better handled by a letter to me by the member .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
mr. puqiqnak .
question 364 - 1 ( 3 ) :
status of gjoa haven water situation
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i have a question to the minister of community government .
on february 18 , in rankin inlet i asked the minister if he had directed his staff to deal with an urgent issue in gjoa haven , regarding the gjoa haven water contamination .
the residents are still waiting for government staff , to meet with the government .
they want to talk to them about ordering parts for the reservoir system .
mr. speaker , i spoke to gjoa haven on friday to the sao of the hamlet , i wanted an update on what was being done about the gjoa haven water contamination .
apparently the hamlet of gjoa haven has not been informed as to where this situation is .
the sao does not know .
so my question to the minister is , can he tell me and the people of gjoa haven today , what his department is doing about the water contamination .
can you give me an update about the gjoa haven water situation .
speaker :
minister anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the equipment for the water reservoir was brought in and set up , however there was a leak and the employee there is working on it .
i am informed that employee is capable of doing the work in the community .
besides that there is some more specialized work that needs to be done .
once the budget is approved , we will be spending that portion for this project .
we will also do an estimate on how much it will cost for a new reservoir .
once we find out how much it costs we will decide during this fiscal year what to do on a long-term basis .
we know this current reservoir is over twenty years old and we know that there have been many repairs done during its life .
these repairs have been becoming more numerous as it gets older .
our intention is to build a new reservoir in the near future .
we are working on this problem and i will provide information that is more detailed to the mla and the hamlet by letter .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. anawak .
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i want to thank the minister for providing that information and the promise to give more details to the community and myself .
however he talked about funding but did not tell us how much money they were going to spend on this problem .
i am concerned that although he said there would be money there is no real commitment on how much or where it will come from .
where in the main estimates is this project .
i cannot find it in the main estimates , that is my concern .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
yes , our employee , kojo kumi , is the engineer for community government &amp; transportation and he has asked the regional kitikmeot department to find the financing .
once we find the price tag we will inform the member , all the members and the people of gjoa haven .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. barnabas .
question 365 - 1 ( 3 ) :
criteria for capital
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is directed to mr. anawak , minister of community government &amp; transportation .
what are the criteria for capital projects used by his department .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
yes , at this point in time we have not completed this .
however , we are using the criteria that gnwt had used previously .
we will try to find solutions to the problems but we do not have permanent criteria to follow up on now regarding capital projects .
at this point in time we don &apos;t have a permanent criteria that we can follow up .
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
if we have been using the gnwt criteria for nunavut projects , i do not quite understand the position the government has especially when it comes to arenas .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. anawak
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
yes , we would like to see what nunavummiut want when making up criteria &apos;s for nunavut government and i also want input from the members as well as their constituencies .
there are only three communities in nunavut that do not have an arena yet .
however , the member &apos;s , one of the communities of the members constituency has an arena but it is not up to standard so we will have to look into that .
in the coming years we will be reviewing all the communities that have arenas including the constituencies , two constituencies of the member .
in the baffin region three communities do not have an arena yet .

i can recall the minister making a response to me that they had set up a task force to review these concerns .

thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. kattuk .
minister responsible for housing , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i can recall the question that was posed by the member .
i have received that report of the task force on housing , but i do not have it right here with me , it is with my department .
i have not reviewed the whole report as of yet .
so , i regret to say that i have not completely read the report as of yet , however , i understand where his concerns are coming from .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you ms. thompson .
mr. kattuk , supplementary .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :

question 367 - 1 ( 3 ) :
technical division for the housing corporation
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker my question is for the minister responsible for the housing corporation .
mr. speaker , i was very happy to officially hear today in her minister &apos;s statement that there will be stand alone nunavut housing corporation .
mr. speaker some member &apos;s will know that this is something that i have been pushing for and the member &apos;s i know within the housing area have been pushing for right from pre-division .
i am glad it has finally come about in my mind it is too bad it has taken so long to do so .
as far as i am aware mr. speaker , technical division or section of the housing corporation was moved over to public works .
with this stand alone corporation , mr. speaker , are there plans to move the technical division back into the corporation .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister responsible for housing , ms. thompson .

mr. tootoo :
another thing that i am very grateful to hear , thank you , mr. speaker .
can the minister indicate as the timeline or timeframe when that &apos;s going to happen and has that information been passed down to the departmental district and local staff .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
however , we wanted to be prepared for some changes within housing corporation .
thank you , mr. speaker .

question 368 - 1 ( 3 ) :
inuit qaujimajatuqangit in dealing with foster children
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is directed to my fellow colleague minister of health and social services .
further to my question previously , in the response that you made regarding foster children and the fact they are dealt with by social workers in the communities .
they do not have any traditional knowledge in collaboration with social services act .
i just want to ask the minister if he will integrate traditional knowledge to their criteria .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. picco
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , that includes the total department of health and social services .
we will be doing that type of review and bringing in expertise from elders and inuit in nunavut .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
mr. iqaqrialu .
supplementary .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
perhaps if i can re-phrase my question .
who will set up the inuit qaujimajatuqangit committee ?
if we are going to be using their traditional knowledge , who in the department will set up such a committee .
will it be the department of health or department of social services ?
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister responsible for health and social services , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , that is a good question .
as the member knows the department of health is integrated with social services , so we are the department of health and social services .
many of our social workers are inuit and use inuit qaujimajatuqangit in their daily jobs mr. speaker .

question 369 - 1 ( 3 ) :
staff housing policy
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , once again , my question is for the minister responsible for housing .
last spring mr. speaker and again in february in rankin i inquired as to the staff housing policy .
i &apos;d like to ask the minister responsible if she in fact has that policy .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :

supplementary .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my understanding is a concern that i raised last spring as to how staff units were being allocated .
if they don &apos;t have a completed policy now mr. speaker i would like to ask what the department is using in allocating staff housing units right now .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
we are using the policy that was in place before the current policy that we are working on .
there was always a policy dependent on the number of children and the number of people in the household .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
oral questions .
supplementary , mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker if i may ask the minister how long has the staff been working on developing the new policy and can we get a firm date as to when that will be completed .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the policy is finished with but i have to discuss it with my cabinet members .
that is the only step that we have to go through i have to discuss at our next cabinet meeting and i believe it will be an agenda item very shortly .
thank you .
speaker :
mr. tootoo
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker also i asked the minister how long the staff has been working on it .
but i &apos;m just wondering mr. speaker does she plan on bringing to before cabinet is that the policy that she committed to in rankin on february 22 to table .
or was she planning to table the old policy .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
during our rankin inlet meeting , i said we wanted to use the old policy and if he wishes to see a copy of the older policy i can make that available .
as for the new policy , once i meet with the cabinet members then i will be able to issue that policy .
he was asking me how long my staff members have been working on the policy .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you ms. thompson .
mr. alakannuark .
question 370 - 1 ( 3 ) :
petroleum products in repulse bay and pelly bay
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
i have a question regarding petroleum products in repulse bay and pelly bay .
i understood the response she made but i am wondering what time and when they plan to build the gas tanks in repulse bay and pelly bay .
that question is directed to the minister responsible for petroleum products .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
probably the men understand the jargon that i am using when i refer to the 45 gallon barrels .
i think that is what the member is referring to .
we had those flown into the communities as far as i understand it to repulse bay and pelly bay .
i know for sure they sent them on an urgent basis to repulse bay for use by airplanes .
i have not heard any urgent issues from the airplanes for filling up .
but if he is referring to the big tanks , we do not have those available but they were going to try to provide an alternate source of fuel .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you minister thompson .
supplementary , mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i understand the question and the response but i was concerned about this in particular .
over in the keewatin region we do not get airplanes that often and i was wondering if it was because there was a shortage of airplane fuel .
is that why we do not get airplanes in the keewatin and repulse bay or is this dependent on our airline schedules .
i have been asked by people when we will be able to get airplanes going into repulse bay , and that was my question , mr. speaker . thank you .
speaker :
minister thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
i understand the question but although they have gas , the plane does not go there very often because there are not enough passengers .
that could also be part of the problem .
so for the time being we have provided 45 gallon barrels of gas on an interim basis .
i know that people like to travel from repulse bay to pelly bay and other communities but i don &apos;t know if planes will be travelling more frequently dependent on the big gas tanks .
as long as there are not enough passengers that are willing to travel , it can be part of the reason , even if there are gas supplies readily available .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
oral questions .
supplementary , mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i understand very clearly and i am grateful .
so that is why i keep bringing this question up , my people keep asking if there could be a new airplane route in the region .
so i understand very well .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
i don &apos;t hear a question there but ms. thompson , if you would care to respond .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i too understand what the member is trying to say in that he is hoping to see a new airline schedule between those three communities .
i am sure it could make everything easier but i am just the person in charge of petroleum products and i am not in charge of airplanes .
that is what i can say .

support for businesses
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question is directed to the minister responsible for sustainable development .
money towards economic development initiatives for the year 2000 / 2001 seems to have been decreased .
for the small businesses that want to start up in their business endeavours , how much assistance can they receive today by way of financial assistance for economic initiatives .
thank you , mr. speaker .

hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i did not understand the question , i am sorry .
can he repeat it .
speaker :
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i will try to make it very clear .
if i was interested in starting up my own small business , i am aware that there is funding available from the government for my start up costs .
what do i have to do in order to obtain some funding .
do i have to have a small start up amount already before i can apply to obtain funding .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
that is almost done completely where people can go and get information at one place .
it is called the noble house here in iqaluit .
we have staff available there now but for those that are interested in different things , they can apply through our department .
it varies , mr. speaker .

mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :

the criteria that is being developed has not been tabled yet .
is that right mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i think we are having a bit of a misunderstanding .
i thought he was talking about the program initiatives that people can access by way of funding .
we are trying to keep them all in one division .
that division is almost ready to start but i think i misled him when i said the wrong thing in my response .
so i hope this makes it clearer .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you minister .
supplementary , mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
if i want to get some money do i have to follow certain criteria from somewhere .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
yes , in that division where we are trying to set down the criteria , we are doing them in inuktitut and english .
we wanted all the application forms and the necessary documents in both languages .
many people have asked the same questions because they do not know what the application process is .
at this time our staff members are co-ordinating all the application processes because if a person wants to start up a business he can be eligible for different programs with different criteria .
whether it is for smaller businesses , they can all come to the one office and get assistance for those applications .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
oral questions .
final supplementary , mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .

lastly , for those people that want to start up their own small businesses , how much funding assistance can they be eligible for from the government department .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
first , a person who is interested in starting their own small businesses certainly will have to meet some criteria .

question 372 - 1 ( 3 ) :
access roads
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to direct my question to the premier .
i will start with a preamble about the streets or roads .
when we were part of the government of the northwest territories there was a problem where most of the money was being used for highways .
so we started using that for access roads in the smaller communities .
today i find that the present government is proposing to build a road from manitoba to nunavut .
i would like an update as to what is happening with the highway that is going to be built and what is happening with the access roads .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. barnabas .
i believe there are two questions there .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
we are going to be asking for some funds from the federal government to pay for that manitoba-nunavut road .
looking at access roads , we are looking at made for nunavut transportation roads and access roads .
that is the only way that i can answer your question .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question was in regards to access roads .
would that money be used then .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :

i can only say that our minister is going to be making a proposal and i am sure that the appropriate minister will be able to respond to your question once he gets back .

construction training
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is directed to the minister of sustainable development .
i will just go ahead with my question then .
this is supplementary to a question that was brought up in regards to access housing or the hap program .
there was no training involved with the people who have built those houses .
some people cannot keep up with the cost of living .
the program helped them in one way but it did not on the other hand .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :

thank you members .
let us get back to order .
on friday we were dealing with the department of education and their business plan .
we also heard the minister &apos;s opening remarks on friday .
if he has any witnesses with him he will make an introduction .
can the minister indicate whether he wants to make his opening remarks again or have his witnesses with him in the witness stand .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
if they start asking me questions then i will want my witnesses at the witness stand with me .
but before they ask me any questions i will stay in my seat .
thank you , mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk , minister for education .
are there any questions .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i welcome the opportunity to give introductory remarks as we begin debate of the main estimates for education as chairman of the standing committee on culture , education and health .
our members have taken great interest in matters of education and very much support the bathurst mandate which listed education and housing as two priorities for the government .
the standing committee has met with the minister on a number of occasions over the last year and has issued two reports with recommendations .
members have supported the dissolution of the district education councils and look forward to the local district education authorities having a stronger role in education .
members have also supported the decentralization plans and look forward to the day when the education positions are established in their new home communities in nunavut .
we also questioned the addition of larger gyms and heritage facilities in other projects when these pressing needs are not able to be met .
committee members were also disappointed that the capital plans were not adjusted in this regard .
members are also concerned about income support programs which many people in our communities depend on for their basic needs .
our standing committee notes that the department has re-organized its delivery of income support in an effort to train local workers and have more community involvement .
as well , the department has initiated an income support review and members look forward to the results of this consultation with nunavummiut .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak , chairman of the standing committee on culture , education and health .
thank you . mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. chairperson .
yes , i want my witnesses deputy minister bob moody and assistant deputy minister naullaq arnaquq to join me .
i would like to ask a question if you let me mr. chairman .
there are 6 officials from my department they are ian rose , nancy hyland , murray horn , david claude , arctic college , sandy teiman , income support programs .
i am wondering if they can stand here to be prepared to answer some questions , more detailed questions .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. minister of education , yes your officials can stand by .
the minister indicated that he wanted to have his officials stand by and answer some tough questions .
thank you mr. minister and staff .
however , this is not our standard so we are learning our rules so if the minister is prepared now he can make his introduction of the members so we can record them .
thank you mr. minister .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
on my right is my deputy minister bob moody and on my left assistant deputy minister naullaq arnaquq .
furthest from my left , connie brown our finance officer ;
ian rose is right beside her the director of policy and planning ;
seated next to him is sandy teiman income support programs director ;
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister for your introduction .
at this time we are open for comments or questions to the department of education .
if there are any questions at this time you can now start .
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i would like to ask some questions about the information that has been provided .
maybe i will speak in english .
why don &apos;t they use a simple term for parent teacher ratios .
i think there should be simpler terms when they start distributing funds to the communities .
i just want to ask the minister why they are still using old terminology .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. barnabas .
mr. minister .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
maybe i can answer the question .
yes we took over some of the gnwt &apos;s department of education criteria when it came to parent teacher ratios .
we have adopted some of the terms that were handed down to us form the gnwt &apos;s department of education .
we are reviewing all the aspects of education &apos;s mandates to try to use some simpler terms for the public , because we received some input when it came to education .
there were many communities that asked to see if the principal would also be a part of the teachers to take on classes in the school to relieve some of the overcrowding .
therefore , we stated maybe after july 1 we would contact the local education councils for their input in this important matter .
so , we will be involving all the communities and the local education authorities .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
any more questions .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr chairman , in the minister of finance &apos;s budget address it highlighted quite an area on education .
in there he talked about what i believe was 400 thousand dollars for the development of the inuktitut curriculum and 1.2 million dollars for increasing teachers and another 1.5 somewhere else .
anyway , i remember it totalled up to 3.1 million dollars of new initiatives for the department .
as i indicated earlier in the session , the o &amp; m dollars have only gone up 534 thousand dollars .
maybe you can ask the minister to inform us as to where the dollars are coming from for these new initiatives .
what programs are being cut as a result of that .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. minister or whoever wants to answer that question you are free to do so .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
the question the member is asking about 1.2 million dollars , is on the new teaching positions .
the 400 thousand dollars is for inuktitut curriculum development , which we talked about earlier in the session .
in that 400 thousand dollars , in the phase 1 part we will be doing design and development , research with elders in arviat for 67 thousand dollars .
we will have two focus meetings with inuit educators .
that will be another 4 thousand dollars and design work for 86 thousand dollars .
theme development for 120 thousand and the editing , which is another 3 thousand and material production , theme units , tapes , etc . , etc , will be about 30 thousand dollars .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
you went into detail on one project only and not the total 3.1 million dollars .
so is the total 3.1 million dollars coming from other programs within the department entirely .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister for education .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
yes , and income support .
okay , let &apos;s take day-care for example .
there was approximately a 30 thousand dollar reduction in the budget .
that is because there was a rollover from last year .
using the old formula contribution or distribution of the funds to the day care centres across nunavut , under the previous gnwt formula system , there was unspent money .
we also initiated a quick study on the financing or funding requirements for the day care centres , and i would like to get this interim report by april 30 .
maybe a final report by the end of may so that we will create a funding system for day care systems that is more relevant to nunavut .
the old method of contributions to day care centres is still from the gnwt and there were some funding rules under that .
so where we found the amounts to get this total is in very small amounts in many places , and i do not know exactly where all of them are .
most of them are very small , to make up that total amount .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i will get back to the rollover of funds for day cares later .
also , on the 1.2 million dollars for new teachers and new teaching positions i believe is that is what that is for .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. minister .
hon. james arvaluk :
yes mr. chairman .
that is for the new teachers , 1.2 is for the new teachers for the extraordinary growth and the demand to skip ... audio unavailable ...
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i remember last year having the same questions .
is the 1.2 to be put to new additional teachers above and beyond the ones that we have right now in the schools in nunavut .
thank you mr. chairman .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. minister .
hon. james arvaluk :
yes mr. chairman .
this is an increase enrolment in school .
it requires additional funding to maintain current people teacher ratio .
funding provided is for salary dollars for new teachers , resource materials for students .
additional student supplies for schools .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman maybe i can ask minister or his staff .
if they know exactly the number of teachers we have in nunavut right now .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. mr. tootoo .
minister of education .
hon. james arvaluk :
mr. chairman i am not exactly sure . i think we have around 725 teachers .
we could get that exact number if you needed . if you want .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman maybe i will ask this last question .
i will take a break for a little while and let some of the members ask questions .
when the minister is getting the number of teachers , could i ask could it also show the specifically for iqaluit .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister for education .
hon. james arvaluk :
we can ask the divisional board of education for baffin region to give us that number .
i can not guarantee that but we will ask for that information .
when we get it yes , we will supply that thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
you indicated that was your final question .
mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman . from 1999-2000 and 2000-2001 fiscal year under the income support program according to last year &apos;s figures there was 2.6 million allocated for that division .
now i see it is now 2 million for this new fiscal year .
i see a reduction and we have many people that are depended on this .
does this reflect the number that depend on these programs have declined .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kattuk .
mr. minister of education .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i said briefly that what we are doing now is reviewing the income support programs .
some people often are not actually dependent , they can apply for unemployment or use other options but because those people that are dependent on income support assistance .
i know he wants an answer but i think i will defer the question to my assistant .
as to whether that is the actual case , i will defer my question to my official .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister of education .
the minister has deferred his question for his official to respond on his behalf .
i believe his name is mr. moody .
mr. moody :
the member is referring on page 9-1-3 .
these numbers actually do not relate at all to payments to clients .
these numbers relate to monies in support of the headquarters .
this does not affect the monies that are available for clients .
it is headquarter money . for example , the staff that run the policy shop here in iqaluit .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. moody .
mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i am asking that question because i was wondering if i would be able to get a response for people who are on income support .
in the fiscal year 2000-2001 do the amounts remain the same .
has it decreased , has it increased .
can i get a response to that question .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kattuk .
mr. minister of education .
i recognized you .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i was getting a quick briefing .
i am told we do not have very much space right now .
we have a lot of paper that we have to work with .
but anyway , i understand that the number of people that are dependant on the income support programs remain the same .
for example although the population numbers have increased , the people dependent on assistance have not increased .
there has been a slight increase under this program .
what we are trying to say is this ; people who are already employed have increased in number .
they are less dependent on social assistance .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister of education .
mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you chairman .
further to my question .
this is concern i have had for a while in the house under the housing assistance program .
people are having a hard time keeping up with their mortgage payments .
i have talked about the different expenses that keep getting inflated .
i wonder if a person who has trouble paying for his utilities would be able to receive temporary income support .
are they able to come to your department for assistance temporarily .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. minister of education .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
for those people who have homeownership if they put in an application for higher learning or for upgrading or for carving training whatever what might help to assist in their income .
they would be eligible to receive income support from us if they are willing to take on jobs or training .
we expect that the social assistance programs , which i mentioned about two weeks ago , will be reviewed .
there has to be a comprehensive review done .
if a person wants social assistance , you have to find out if he is willing to look for work in the interim and that changes his eligibility .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister of education , mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
when you total his living expenses they over extend his incoming salary .
and a lot of the time his pay cheque is gone before he can finish his payments and this happens to many people who are employed .
i think we know that sometimes they need temporary assistance , which is why i brought that up as an example .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kattuk .
mr. minister of education .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
i do not hear a question .
i do not know giving support working people but anyone could approach social services .
the social worker would do an assessment on the person .
i am sure the reply would be according to the policies that are followed by social services .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister of education .
mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i think that this would be my last comment and question .
usually when you live in a community , you know who received income support and who they are working for .
of course , they usually follow the policies when they give income support to families .
has there been a decrease in the monthly allowances that are given out to the people and what is the ceiling of the salaries where they would be considered the eligible for income support .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. kattuk .
mr. minister of education .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
we follow the same policy so we have to do an assessment or review to see whether the levels and the educational financial support given to them are still adequate in today &apos;s cycle .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister of education .
before we go onto another item , we will take a five minute break .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
are there any questions .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman as i indicated earlier .
the total of operations &amp; maintenance for education is gone up 540 thousand dollars .
mr. chairman , do your math that is 34 thousand new dollars put into the department of education on operations &amp; maintenance .
one of the top 2 priorities of this government is education .
i do not see that personally as an expense , it is an investment .
thank you mr. mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. minister of education .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
we are just one part of the membership of the cabinet and the government .
we know that there is so much that can go around through different departments .
i think we can be very positive in the department of education that the budget is up 2.8 million and 8.5 million dollars in capital .
you know that &apos;s double from previous year .
i believe this is a good budget for the education and for the government .
although the member is right , we all wanted more for our own department .
especially the education but there is only so much to go around .
i am optimistic that with our 1.2 million provided for additional teachers and 400 thousand for inuktitut curriculum it will help us in the long run .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister of education .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman the minister indicated 2.8 million dollar increase in the total overall budget of the department .
so if you take that project out mr. chairman .
i mean if you take that project out that is being covered by insurance , you have a decrease in capital of well over 2 million dollars from the previous year .
again , i just wanted to state for the record that i am not very happy with the numbers coming forward like that .
you can paint numbers however you like and to make it look good .
but you know the fact of the matter is 34 thousand new dollars and a reduction in capital taken out of a new major project that is covered by insurance .
to me i am very disappointed in that and you know i just do not how that can comply with what we all said is our top priority .
i guess it is somewhat late to do anything about that now .
also the minister of finance indicated earlier to me that last week i believe that there had been indeed a concerted effort to ensure additional resources into the two priorities areas .
you know looking at the budget this one and the other ones .
it looks to me a lot like status quo budget from previous years .
which again is disappointing .
but getting back to this 1.2 million dollars the minister had indicated .
how many new teachers is that going to put in nunavut .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. minister of education .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
i will not comment on the general comments because that is the member &apos;s comments .
that 1.2 million will bring about 14 new teachers .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister of education .
mr. tootoo any further comments .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i can appreciate those comments were not mainly for the minister but for everyone to hear . twelve to fourteen teachers have those been allocated .
have there been any allocations for where the teaching positions are going to be .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. minister of education .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
i will ask mr. moody to answer that question .
chairperson :
mr. moody .
mr. moody :
that process has begun .
our plan is mr. chairman that the boards will know where those positions will go before the end of april .
that has not been done to my knowledge this early ever before .
but it will do much benefit to get that information out now rather than wait until october or november .
so assuming we can get all the information we have been asking for .
it is our plan to let the divisional education &apos;s know where the position will be allocated before the end of april .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. moody .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman i did some looking in through my files during the break and i found the information that i was looking for regarding the teachers here in iqaluit .
in iqaluit right now we have 63 teachers .
many our classrooms are overcrowded .
there is some to high 20 &apos;s for people teacher ratios right now .
the minister indicated earlier that these new teachers will be on top of the teachers that we have on the actual teachers we have of right now .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. minister of education .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
i like to make two comments .
we like to find out first where the real needs are in all of nunavut .
we will get that from divisional councils of those three regions .
i can not just comment on one community like iqaluit whether they have the greatest need right now in comparison to other communities .
we will get that from the divisional boards .
secondly , i agree with everything mr. tootoo has said about his comment about there will be deficiencies in the funding for the department of education .
we were not being at full capacity in the last 6 months for example .
we are becoming to a full capacity to do the work .
i think the member would also appreciate this is the year of change .
the year of reviewing everything so what we do is in fact good for nunavut .
i share similar comments that the member was making .
that we have to look at what the real needs are .
how do we make our bathurst mandate more into reality .
as far as education is concerned but i am happy that the government has indicated in fact twice that the savings for the divisional boards .
for example , minor capitals that we were able to announce yesterday , setting up a library in the middle school , you know , these kind of things .
we have to wait until we get the auditor &apos;s report to know exactly what the surplus may be or what the savings are .
that is why i am very reluctant to include estimated surpluses , because they are only estimates in this budget .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister of education .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
the classes are booming and we &apos;ve had closures because teachers can &apos;t make it and there are no subs .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. minister of education .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
we have to find the numbers , we have to find the numbers first , because some communities the numbers may go down .
i assure you this government , the cabinet , when i have been meeting with them is absolutely sincere about wanting to do the right thing in the area of education for children .
therefore , i am confident they will not let any of us parents or students down .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
the contribution .
( interpretation ends ) it decreased from 1.142 million to 1.398 million .
sorry .
( interpretation ) why is there a decrease here again .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. barnabas .
mr. minister of education .
whenever you are ready mr. minister , you can make your response .
if you are going to have a briefing there perhaps we can take a short break .
whenever you are ready to respond mr. minister .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
yes , perhaps going back to cultural programs grants and contributions is , we have put in 400 thousand dollars there .
there are also some breakdowns on these two .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i just want to know what the funding will be used for .
i am just wondering what the money that has been allocated will be used for in the future years .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. barnabas .
however , i will let the minister of education respond to your question .
so , it is open for response .
mr. minister .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
this funding is expected from the federal government .
maybe i can get mr. moody to explain more .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. moody .
mr. moody :
mr. chairman .
the items on this page , two of the four lines here are likely to change during the year .
it &apos;s money coming in from outside the government of nunavut .
what we hope that would be for but that &apos;s not firm .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. moody .
mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
my name is alakannuark not alakannuk .
my question is regarding the number of students in the communities after they complete the elementary schools programs the graduates that would like to go onto universities and colleges for higher learning .
however , some of them are not used to going out of the communities and leaving their families .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
mr. minister .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
after having extended grades in the communities the department of education has also decided to review some of the post -secondary programs to see if they could also be used in the schools .
we all know we cannot have such programs in all the schools but we are thinking about setting up some type of regional post-secondary education facilities .
there are two schools or two universities , nova scotia universities that the government of nunavut has made an agreement with to see if we would be able to send students to .
we were talking with them to see if we could have a two-way orientation program and an introduction to colleges .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i know we reviewed these documents and we did approve them obviously , but i am not entirely satisfied .
the documents that were tabled are a priority and i have been asking what the surplus numbers are .
today the department of education indicates they have a surplus of 9.1 million dollars , if the information is accurate .
at the same time there seemed to be insufficient funds last year because i have been asking the government about a capital project .
they should be friendly in their responses but they have not agreed to do this capital project in my riding and yet they have apparently a surplus of 9.1 million dollars
i am not entirely satisfied with that information .
i understand that they were to build a school in cambridge bay that would cost 14.2 million dollars .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
that &apos;s for your information , i apologize , but that is in the rules .
if you have other questions we are more than welcome to accommodate you .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
okay mr. chairman , my apologies .
this document was placed before me .
why is it so expensive .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
mr. minister .
if you wish to respond .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
first , perhaps this school , when it burned down , the initial insurance was at a set amount .
but every year as houses or buildings get older they depreciate .
should they be sold , also called amortisation , and because that figure keeps changing the amount for insurance purposes also decreases .
insurance is always comparable to the buying price .
but if we want to make it usable to 2005 we would be wiser to build for the future , for the future requirements and so the insurance would change .
i believe we would pay the 75 % ratio of that and so we made an agreement to that effect .
so , these figures that were set aside for the designing of the building and all the other aspects of the building is about 14 million dollars in total .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
maybe i will save my general comments for later .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
concerning lack of teachers .
i understood the response and the explanation provided concerning the iqaluit teachers saying there is a certain number of teachers will be provided for iqaluit and they talked about the student teacher ratio .
there was a question as to how many teacher positions would be created after the 1 million dollar allocation i understood the response to be 12-14 teacher positions .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
mr. minister of education .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
as the student enrolment numbers increase we have to have a direct proportion of teachers and we do not cut teacher positions while the increases occur .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
just to point out mr. minister , perhaps you should try to keep your microphone closer , because sometimes we do not get all the information you are saying .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
this means a full time teacher and a part time teacher .
those positions are in the plan to be eliminated .
does he know about that .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
mr. minister .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
if that is the case , that is a good question .
the baffin divisional board of education can give us that information and we can probably give him that information tomorrow while we are still in these discussions .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
although we try to ask questions during question period we never seem to have enough time .
we have numerous questions so i thought this would be the best forum to get responses .
the ratio of students enrolling are increasing , teacher positions seem to be eliminated , so much so that there is overcrowding and we have to have grade 3 students in three different classes .
i know he understands my reference to the 1.5 positions .
he has to take a good look at these figures because it is a big concern .
i thought that by using this forum i would be getting responses and i would appreciate if he would respond to me during a forum like this in committee of the whole .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. nutarak .
mr. arvaluk indicated that he will get information from the baffin divisional board of education and he will respond to you formally in the house .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
i am sorry mr. chairman , i said two things .
he can do it in this forum through committee of the whole , or through a written form but i requested that he respond to me in committee of the whole .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
we understand your request mr. nutarak .
does the minister of education wish to respond further .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
mr. chairman , i agree with his request .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
my question is concerning the elders and youth division .
i know that the department of education should be working with that division .
what kinds of learning programs do you plan to promote within those two departments .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. akesuk .
mr. minister .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
mr. chairman , for the students that are either graduated or not graduated .
which one is he referring to .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
i am talking about grade 12 graduates .
i would think that it would be easier for them to access post-secondary programs because we do not have very many students entering university type levels .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. akesuk .
mr. minister if you understand the question .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
yes , i keep moving away from my microphone .
mr. chairman we are going to try and do something about that and we want to do our review under the income support programs as i have mentioned .
we will also be looking at the student financial assistance programs .
we are going to promote the universities , such as dalhousie or carleton .
there are a number of universities that we are starting to work together with and we will be sending some more people down to the universities .
we helped them out in , particularly st. mary &apos;s university , we will be taking grade 11 and grade 12 students for orientation at the universities .
we want to encourage their preparedness before their graduation .
the reason being when you deal with complex subjects certain academic levels are required .
for those that are interested in attending college , then their subjects are usually more general but you need specific credits for specific subjects that you wish to learn in universities .
we want to get this information out to students , give them information as to what credits they will need in order to go to university and college .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
i am sure all this will cost money too .
i am wondering just how much you plan on using for this review .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. akesuk .
mr. minister .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i am sorry i missed the first part of his question . if he could repeat it .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i am sure that there will be funding required to undergo this review .
how much does he estimate he will need to do the review .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. akesuk .
mr. minister .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
mr. chairman , i thought he was referring to income support programs .
is he referring to the review of the income support programs .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
he was just talking about doing a review as to which schools will be reviewed .
that is my questions .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. akesuk .
mr. minister .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
this is just going to be a promotional thing .
we want to get information out to the communities . we want students to know if you are interested in going to university this is what you have to do to prepare to go .
however , we use our staff to work this out .
we only pay for the student &apos;s per diems and living arrangements .
so that is what we provide but as for the promotion , our current staff does that .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
my question is in 9 - 14 in your binders .
for the year 2000 under the revised estimates there is 365 , compensation and benefits .
i apologize .
it is on page 9 - 14 in your binders .
these are three questions that i have under field operations .
it is in regards to the major increases and decreases .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. barnabas .
your questions are in the main estimates .
i appreciate your questions but they are right in the main estimates .
we will be dealing with these items by item when the time comes .
right now we are under general questions and general comments .
we will get into the main estimates at the appropriate time .
if you would like to respond to the member &apos;s questions .
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
yes , i would like to respond .
there is a three million dollar increase in here .
why is that .
i do know that we will get into the main estimates at the appropriate time but i do have this question .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. barnabas .
minister of education .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
mr. chairman , the increase by 3.3 million dollars was on another page last year .
we moved it from that to another department and i could ask one of our staff to answer that question .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
he could probably give us a detailed report when we get into the main estimates .
it &apos;s okay we do not have to get into it right now but i will bring that up again at the main estimates .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. barnabas .
we will be getting into the main estimates .
mr. havioyak .
mr. havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman ....
technical difficulties ...
our elders need to be used in our educational system .
there will be more people looking for employment , how will these young people , once they begin to find employment , how will programs be directed to them towards their enhancement .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
minister of education .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
this question is for personnel . it is in regards to personnel .
his question is about using elders in the education system .
yes , if they are teachers and if they are certified .
i do not believe that is the direction of his question .
i believe his question is more about casual employment of the elders and for instructors in cultural programs .
they are not here but we could use the elders using the enter program .
we did that in arviat , i believe we used four elders who we enrolled into the enter program .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. havioyak .
mr. havioyak :
thank you mr. chairman .
it is something that we need to do in schools .
i am just saying that i would like to see some of the elders involved in this .
you mentioned casual work but we have to put them in the future more into permanent positions .
again , i would just like to see that .
are there some plans for that .
koanna .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. havioyak .
minister of education .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i totally agree with you .
we do not want to stop any elders who want to become certified teachers .
but we do not have any plans on any programs specifically geared for unilingual people .
( interpretation ends ) i am sorry i had forgotten that the member had switched from inuinnaqtun .
we do not disagree , but we also have to think about the students who will be receiving the instruction from the elders .
not all people are instructors .
i think when we have a little bit more authority over the deas then they will have to recommend to us what is the best community for them in their schools .
at the moment we are going through the divisional boards , as to how the staffing , especially the local staffing , is being done .
they may be a specialist in some areas , but somebody else may have to be a specialist in another area of their expertise and train from there .
i have no objection to that at all .
but the stakes that we have to recognize is the students .
that &apos;s the bottom line is the students . how do we get the best quality of education for our students .
if we can get that from one or two elders , for the majority of the speciality programs , cultural programs and everything else , that would be great .
but that does not happen in most of the cases , because anybody is only a specialist in their own field .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. havioyak .
mr. havioyak :
so it is going to be interesting who certifies these elders .
they are already certified in their own culture .
it is going to be interesting .
i just wanted to make that comment .
koanna .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. havioyak .
minister of education , did you have further comments .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
i think the member will appreciate that some people are very good at going up the river and going fishing in the inland or caribou hunting in the inland .
some are specialists in walrus hunting on the floe ice .
i guess what i am getting at is that students must have all the exposures that they deserve in the cultural programs .
you cannot just teach them only what that particular elder knows .
if that particular elder knows some of these things and another elder knows other things better than the other one .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister of education .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
just to clarify or help to bring some clarity to some of the information that mr. irqittuq referred to earlier .
if he &apos;d be willing to table that for us .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. minister of education .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
we already have given that to the standing committee and the information was given to us from public works .
if public works wants to make it available we have no objection to that because we already gave it to the standing committee .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i just wanted to , there was some confusion as to what we can ask questions on and what we can &apos;t .
just to make sure we have all the information that was there so that there &apos;s no confusion on what we can and can &apos;t ask questions about .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
the motion is in order and is not debatable .
so , i will ask the speaker to come back to the house .
i am sorry all those in favour .
motion is carried .
okay , our speaker will coming back into the house .

toonik tyme
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
in keeping with this spirit mr. speaker , i would like to announce that on the afternoon of april 7 will be declared a half-day civic holiday for all nunavut government employees in iqaluit .
this is consistent with the town of iqaluit &apos;s municipal holiday for their employees .
mr. speaker by declaring this holiday the nunavut government employees will be able to join their families and encourage them to take part in the annual toonik tyme activities .
mr. speaker similar half-day civic holidays for our nunavut government employees will also be granted to the communities who declare hamlet days or the equivalent for their spring activities .
mr. speaker i encourage all nunavut government employees of iqaluit to participate in these festivities on friday april 7 .

minister &apos;s statement 101 - 1 ( 3 ) :
new optional leave policy
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr speaker , last year , mandatory leave was a compulsory program for all employees of the government of nunavut except for the federation of nunavut teachers .
this program required a 1 . 92 percent regular payroll salary reduction for all participating employees and provided five days off without pay on the days the employer shut down their operations .
mr. speaker , effective april 1 , 2000 a five day optional leave policy will replace the existing mandatory leave policy for excluded and managerial employees .
employees entitled to participate in this new leave policy will be able to choose which days they will be away from work subject to their supervisors approval .
mr speaker all excluded and managerial type employees will be offered the choice of participating in this optional leave program .
employees who may terminate with unused option leave credits will be reimbursed their payroll deductions for that amount .
mr. speaker , this change will provide our excluded and managerial employees with a better choice of options than presently exists .
thank you , mr. speaker .

inuit qaujimajatuqangit within dsd
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
in our government &apos;s bathurst mandate it is stated that inuit qaujimajatuqangit will provide the context to develop an open , responsive and accountable government .
i would like to speak briefly today about how we are attempting to honour this commitment in my department of sustainable development &apos;s everyday work on programs , policies and legislation .
our first step in introducing inuit qaujimajatuqangit to the department of sustainable development was to establish an inuit qaujimajatuqangit working group which consists of senior inuit officials in the department .
their task is to weave into the government systems the principles and the values of inuit qaujimajatuqangit .
to help the inuit qaujimajatuqangit working group we established six guiding principles based on inuit beliefs and customs .
mr. speaker these principals are being dealt into our department programs , policies , legislation and our everyday approach to work as we speak .
mr. speaker , it is this governments belief that inuit qaujimajatuqangit can greatly enhance our contemporary governing systems .
mr. speaker there is many miles ahead in this journey , but we have started .
in the days ahead , i hope to be able to report back to the house on the further department initiatives with inuit qaujimajatuqangit .
thank you , mr. speaker .

member &apos;s statement 264 - 1 ( 3 ) :
baker lake day-care services
mr. mclean :
i rise today to talk about the plight of day-care services in my community of baker lake .
day cares provide an essential service , not only in my community but also probably in every community in nunavut and canada .
we must recognize that this is as important as school , as the individuals that use these facilities are trying to contribute to nunavut , single working moms and working couples .
they need day-care so they can contribute to our much-needed workforce .
we signed the clyde river protocol agreement that states overall that the nunavut government and nti work together .
mr. speaker , this is an excellent time for nti and the nunavut government to work together to solve part of our very serious and ever growing critical situation of day-care .
thank you , mr. speaker .

iqaluit casting call
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
iqaluit residents have been active in several documentary , t.v. and feature films over the past twenty-five years .
iqaluit residents have also participated in numerous fashion shows held in town and around canada .
mr. speaker the selections 2000 catalogue , which is the mail order arm of the northwest company , picked several iqaluit residents to be featured in their spring / summer 2000 addition .
this magazine can be found in every northern provincial , territorial and many alaskan towns in the north .
mr. speaker i would like to take this opportunity to thank the northern stores for their interest in featuring iqaluit residence and especially iqaluit young people in their magazine .
this is something that all the models will be able to look back on .
mr. speaker , and who knows , one of our own iqaluit models may go on the fashion runways of new york or paris .

gjoa haven ladies hockey team
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i stand today to recognize the women &apos;s hockey team from my community of gjoa haven .
last weekend there was hockey tournament in baker lake where my community members had the privilege to attend .
mr. speaker these are the following people that were part of the team ;
the gjoa haven women &apos;s hockey team enjoyed the trip to baker lake .
the baker lake fans were also very supportive of the gjoa haven hockey players .
the gjoa haven players would like to thank the people of baker lake for their hospitality and send their best wishes .
it was nice for the hockey players to meet new friends and see their old friends and their relatives .
the only regret that the gjoa haven hockey players have is that the players had little training and practice .
the next tournament will be in rankin inlet in the year 2001 .
the gjoa haven women hope the chesterfield inlet and baker inlet women that will go to rankin inlet .
mr speaker the gjoa haven team members received two awards cheryl ann puqiqnak was given the best defence award and rita porter was given the best forward award .
we would like to congratulate them on behalf of gjoa haven .

gift from speaker hickes
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker . today i would like to express my appreciation , just recently the speaker of manitoba visited us and our premier was given a statue of a buffalo .
i had made a remark that i wish i had one too .
i had forgotten about it when today mr. tootoo brought in a gift from george hickes the speaker of the legislature of manitoba .
i had wanted this buffalo and if he is listening i would like to thank george hickes and i think that you mr. speaker should consider polar bears to be given as gifts .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you ms. thompson .
members &apos; statements mr. tootoo .
member &apos;s statement 268 - 1 ( 3 ) :
maintenance problems in schools
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , yesterday morning in iqaluit students at nakasuk elementary school were unable to attend their classes because of the reoccurrence of problems with the schools .
mr. speaker , the system in the school is approximately thirty years old .
it requires continual repairs and maintenance .
the nakasuk school is not the only school to be experiencing these sorts of problems .
students in inukshuk school are unable to use their gymnasium because of yet another recurrence of problems associated with deterioration of the plumbing and ventilation system .
i support the efforts of the government to look into fixing these problems as quickly as possible .
mr. speaker , although both of these schools are in my constituency , students from across iqaluit and apex attend them .
i would be very much surprised if my colleagues from iqaluit west and east did not share my concern about these issues .
we know that there is not an unlimited amount of money .
we cannot build what we need over night .
but mr. speaker the real issue is the one of fairness .
when basic school needs are not being met in so many communities why do others appear to receive facilities and projects that are far beyond the needs of the communities .
mr. speaker every community should have facilities and infrastructure sufficient to met the needs of the students and teachers .
as time goes on and basic needs are met then yes , we should have add-ons to our schools so they can become showpieces .
mr. speaker , it is a question of fairness .
lets make sure that all communities fundamental needs are met for a government to do otherwise is to show that favouritism is condoned .
i doubt that any member of this house wants that to be our principal .
i thank you mr. speaker .

thank you mr. tootoo .

mr. irqittuq .
member &apos;s statement 269 - 1 ( 3 ) :
cost of air cargo
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i rise today to talk about the rising cost of air cargo , especially for the communities of hall beach and igloolik .
we have only one airline that services these communities and since first air has a monopoly they can raise the price anytime , which they do .
using this as an example , this picture here it is a cabinet , a very simple cabinet .
if you order it is 200 hundred ninety-nine dollars , but when it goes to my community with the freight costs it would be over seven hundred dollars .
with that it is getting to be almost impossible to buy these types of goods in my community .
to use another example , looking at the food that is ordered from ottawa or montreal it would be 1 dollar eighteen cents down there .
by the time it arrives to my community with freight costs it would be 2 dollars and fifty-three cents .
so the total i would pay would be almost 4 dollars for that same item .
mr speaker i think that we have to work very hard for people that live in the higher arctic .
it is getting very , very expensive to live in those communities .
&gt; &gt; applause
speaker :
thank you mr. irqittuq .

item 4 :
returns to oral questions
return to oq 341 - 1 ( 3 ) :
housing corporation contracting back services
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i have three returns so if it is okay i would like to read all three of these returns , thank you .
mr. speaker i rise today to provide a response to a question posed to me by mr. tootoo on march 30 , 2000 .
on april 1 , 1999 , the two services were contracted back to the nwt housing corporation .
one was for technical services and the other one was for financial services .
both of these contracts are for a one year term and they expire march 31 , 2000 .
the nunavut housing corporation will not enter formal contracts for technical services for the 2000 / 2001 fiscal year .

housing corporation tender advertisement
mr. speaker i rise today to provide a response to the question posed to me by mr. tootoo on march 28 , 2000 in reference to an ad for housing materials .
the tender advertised clearly identifies the nwt housing corporation as the acting agent for the nunavut housing corporation .
mr. speaker the nunavut housing corp. prepared the tender documents and the proposal will be evaluated and awarded by the nunavut housing corporation .
mr. speaker relying on the expertise of the nwt housing corporation to co-ordinate and analyse this material tender has shown efficient management while the nunavut housing corporation continues to build capacity .
thank you , mr. speaker .
return to oq 191 - 1 ( 3 ) :
staff housing policy
mr. speaker i rise today to provide a response to the question posed to me by mr. tootoo on february 22 , 2000 .
mr. tootoo requested an update on the status of the new staff housing policy .
mr. speaker because the new staff housing policy will impact staff throughout the government of nunavut , officials from other departments have been consulted in drafting the policy .
my staff are in the process of taking a final look at the feedback received and preparing the policy for submission to cabinet .
mr. speaker , a separate policy has been developed to replace the old buy-back policy program administered by the gnwt .
this new policy will be applicable to gn staff whose positions are affected by the government &apos;s decentralization plan .
officials from other departments have also been consulted in developing this policy to ensure that their interests , and interests of staff , have been taken into consideration .
mr. speaker , my staff has compiled and reviewed the feedback received through these consultations and is in the process of preparing this policy for submission to cabinet as well .
thank you mr. speaker .

question 374 - 1 ( 3 ) :
status of workers &apos; compensation board study
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. speaker .
we all know that we are sharing the workers &apos; compensation board with another territory because we seem to think it is easier and more cost effective .
can the minister responsible inform me today what the status of this study is .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na uqaqti .
i realize the minister was very busy in the last couple of months and he probably had to concentrate more on his budget .
but can the minister commit to me today that he will look at initiating a study within the next thirty days .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
so we will to try to do that as much as we can .
thank you .
speaker :
supplementary mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na uqaqti .
i am sure the minister will do this as he has promised .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , the focus of the consultation that would take place would be to see exactly if that were one of the preferred options .
if we wanted a stand alone workers &apos; compensation board specially for nunavut .
i think it &apos;s important to keep that in mind mr. speaker , that it is privately funded by employers , privately funded operations for the best interests of employees .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
oral questions .
mr. barnabas .
question 375 - 1 ( 3 ) :
mandatory leave policy
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i am directing this to the finance minister .
my question is why did you make such a statement , or still keep the policy although we are not in a deficit situation .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i think the honourable member forgot ms. thompson as well that was part of the nwt legislative assembly the last time .
i would like to recognize that as well .
mr. speaker , the member is correct .
the last assembly of the government of the northwest territories did undertake a mandatory leave program that gave employees five days of unpaid leave .
we inherited that same policy on april 1 , 1999 .
so over the course of the past year as i said we had the mandatory leave program with the five days .
the corresponding deductions were taken from our employees &apos; payroll .
so the cabinet as a whole looked at this whole policy in itself because of the fact that we heard many positive responses from our government of nunavut employees on that program .
a lot of them continued to want to have that luxury of having five unpaid leave days .
we decided to make it optional this current fiscal year which started a couple of days ago .
so as i indicated in my minister &apos;s statement mr. speaker , it is optional now for government of nunavut employees .
they do not have to have the five days taken off .
they can continue with full pay and not have five unpaid leave days .
they can take it if they feel it &apos;s best for them mr. speaker .
thank you mr. speaker .
&gt; &gt; applause
speaker :
thank you minister ng .
supplementary mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas :
i do apologize to ms. thompson for not mentioning her as a former mla for the gnwt .
( interpretation ) however , i would like to get clarification mr. speaker we have many staff working for the government of nunavut .
if they used their leave where would the surplus go or are we going to be in a deficit situation .
do we expect to have a deficit situation within this current fiscal year .
what is going to happen to the money that has not been used .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. barnabas .
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker obviously if it &apos;s money that they are not paid as a result of not taking five days of unpaid leave then that money would stay within the government resources .
the government of nunavut resources .
thank you .

mr. puqiqnak .
question 376 - 1 ( 3 ) :
outpost camp program
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i am directing my question to the minister of sustainable development about the outpost camp programs especially for inuit people in nunavut .
in my nattilik riding individuals have been applying for funding for their outpost camps .
they have given their applications to the local hunters and trappers .
some of their applications have been approved by our local hto and they have been supported mr. speaker .
what are , the department of sustainable development in the fiscal year 2000-2001 , plans for the outpost camp program .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i apologize because we have different dialects .
i think he mentioned the names of people and organizations that i missed so could he rephrase his question .
perhaps if he could rephrase his question .
thank you .
speaker :
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
mr. speaker , my question is they are called in english outpost camps , we call it ahiniituqsiutinik .
what kind of plans do you have for the outpost camp program under your sustainable development department .
what kind of plans do you have for the year 2000 for the outpost camp program and what kind of funding are you supplying for the outpost camp programs .
i know more than one person in uqsuqtuq that have applied for funding and they sent applications to the local hto and the local hto had approved them and supported them .
so my main question is what kind of funding program do you have for the outpost program .
thank you .
speaker :
minister kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
we give them support for operations &amp; maintenance totalling a little over 316 thousand , since he had asked me what kind of funding we have .
so that is the amount of funding we allocated to the htos last year .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i like to thank the minister for sustainable development for giving me a good answer .
especially because this is our livelihood we cherish and value our livelihood because the weather is getting warmer now .
that elder meant while he was still physically fit he would like to go out and take his children to the outpost camp .
for that very reason and since i did not realize there were some funds set aside i am very thankful .
so where can we get the application forms in kitikmeot .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
i did not realize the mike was on .
thank you mr. speaker .
first i would like to apologize .
my figures were mixed up when i stated them .
the outpost programs for the htos , there was 223 thousand . it was not 316 thousand dollars .
yes we are especially sensitive to the elders who would like to go out to their old campgrounds .
but we do not have a policy for recreation .
the associations or entities that want that can make applications and we can look at their application or their proposal .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to advise the minister it is not recreational camping .
that is not what i am talking about .
i am talking about our elders because they would like to go out of the community while they are still physically fit .
they would like to go and see their old campgrounds .
i would like the minister to understand that i am not talking about recreational camping .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :

question 377 - 1 ( 3 ) :
details of estimated expenditure variances
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker my question is for the minister of finance .
i would like to thank the minister of finance for tabling the estimated expenditure variance by department yesterday .
mr. speaker , in there variances range from 1.1 million dollars to 9.1 million dollars depending on the department .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister responsible for finance mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
yes , also in addition to that there is also a capital components part of the variance .
thank you .
speaker :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
again , i thank the finance minister for i like those kinds of answers when they are required .
can the minister provide us with some time frame for looking at tabling those .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
yes , mr. speaker i do have the information .
it is a matter of putting it into a presentable format and of course translating it .
i would probably say early next week if not sooner .

question 378 - 1 ( 3 ) :
nunavut &apos;s share of gnwt surplus
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is directed to the minister of finance .
i wonder when we are going to hear from them about what their surplus is .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister responsible for finance .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker there has been some considerable amount of work done on that matter from what i understand .
we expect that our share of that estimated government of the northwest territories &apos; surplus the government of nunavut &apos;s share is probably going to be around 15 million dollars .
right now what is happening is there is a final review of some of the accounts payable that &apos;s taking place .
there is also some work , considerable work being done in respect to how to handle the value of employee entitlements for retirement , for removable benefits , retroactive pay , pay equity settlements .
those types of issues mr. speaker .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. minister .
supplementary mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
because of his response about the money we should be getting i just wondered when that surplus would be coming to the nunavut government and how much it would be approximately .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker as i indicated we are looking at approximately 15 million dollars .
therefore , many the assets we have might be in actual inventory such as fuel products that are contained in the tanks as of april 1 1999 .
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. irqittuq . mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , we heard at that time we would be getting the money and i thought it would be cash , money in the form of cash .
did the minister realize at that time that it would not be just cash , that it would be in assets too at that time .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. minister .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker i believe i said on a consistent basis that it may not be necessarily be cash .
it would depend on what the end result was as to what hard assets in the transfer would be .
thank you mr. speaker .

question 379 - 1 ( 3 ) :
lack of wildlife officer for sanikiluaq
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is directed to the minister of sustainable development .
he mentioned a while ago that local htos and the wildlife officers take care of applications and we do not have a wildlife officer in my community .
at the time we belonged to the nwt government there was to be training for a wildlife officer to be based in my community .
when we became nunavut that was something that was not really transferred to our community from the government of the nwt .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. kattuk .
minister kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
each community has a wildlife officer except for sanikiluaq .
the wildlife officers take care of the regulations in the acts of our nunavut government and managing the wildlife .
when we are looking at the wildlife act we will be looking at the some communities or we will be talk to the communities that have concerns .
i am not exactly sure whether i have the information that he is requesting at this time .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. minister . supplementary mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
will our community be provided with a wildlife officer .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
the wildlife act will be discussed with our staff .

mr. nutarak .
question 380 - 1 ( 3 ) :
pond inlet health centre closure
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is directed to the minister of health and social services .
the nursing station in pond inlet is getting to be very old and there are many sicknesses such as colds and flu this winter .
the nursing station was closed about a week during that time of people having colds and sicknesses .
i just want to find out from the minister of health and social services whether he realized or if he has any knowledge that the nursing station was closed for one week .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister responsible for health and social services , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
but it is open for emergencies at those periods of time .
mr. speaker , the actual incident that the member is talking about i am not aware of .
again , we are open in emergency situations .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. minister .
oral questions . supplementary mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
we have a lack of proper health facilities in many of the communities of nunavut .
for that reason sometimes the community nursing stations are closed so they can catch up on their administrative work .
i just wanted to ask a question of the minister to see if he realizes that the nursing station was closed for about a week .
i just thought that he would know about it , and that is why i asked the question .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , as the member knows i was just in pond inlet recently , a couple of months ago .
the member and i held a public meeting and i would like to thank the member for his hospitality there .
i am wondering if the member could clarify the closure of the pond inlet health centre .
is he talking issues with the staff because of the difficult situation of the flu , or was there a problem with the facility itself .
we have had some discussions , the department and myself with the member about the age of the facility and the possible replacement .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i already mentioned it but it had to do with the piping , the sewage piping .
the sewage piping is underneath the building and i think that is the reason why they were closed down .
people were going to the nursing station and they could not stand the smell .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. picco do you wish to respond to the final supplementary .
proceed .
hon. ed picco :
qujannamiik uqaqti .
okay i understand now .
he was talking about the pipes .
we realize that the facility is an old facility and indeed , mr. speaker , it &apos;s one of the oldest facilities in nunavut .
we are looking at that situation and i would like to thank the member for clarifying it .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you minister .
oral questions .
mr. iqaqrialu .
question 381 - 1 ( 3 ) :
inuit qaujimajatuqangit and the bathurst mandate
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to direct my question to the minister of sustainable development about the comments that he made about inuit qaujimajatuqangit and the bathurst mandate .
it says here that they will be using the inuit qaujimajatuqangit but we also heard that there has to be more support for outpost camps .
outpost camps operate in a traditional manner and they operate more on inuit qaujimajatuqangit values , more so than the regular communities .
i also know that they have to be approved first by the hunters &apos; and trappers &apos; organizations .
my question is , how can we better help the outpost camps because they operate on inuit qaujimajatuqangit values .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the comments that i made about inuit qaujimajatuqangit are going to be used by sustainable development .
these are principles that i have stated , they were first reviewed and then the appropriate sections were integrated into our department .
it &apos;s integrating inuit qaujimajatuqangit and we will be integrating it into our government .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. minister .
supplementary , mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i understand exactly where the minister is coming from .
we are integrating the inuit qaujimajatuqangit into the departments and perhaps i have misunderstood the meaning of inuit qaujimajatuqangit .
i seem to understand that we are just paying lip service to inuit qaujimajatuqangit .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i would also like to thank the member for asking his question .
if we look at the last twenty years , you can probably see that the government &apos;s system was foreign and there was no inuk component within these departments .
we have been asked to integrate inuit qaujimajatuqangit as a nunavut government and we have started that in my department .
if i can use an example to make it more clear about how we are doing this .
one example is where a researcher or a biologist would use an airplane to count a certain species of animals .
it would be in the winter or in any season , the biologist would go out there and check them .
what an inuk would do , depending on the season and depending on what research they would like to do , they could tell you exactly where to go .
so if you are looking at a particular species and the cycle , we are going to be integrating these into my department .
it strengthens modern day government .
speaker :
thank you minister kilabuk .
supplementary , mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
thank you very much for that response , but with inuit qaujimajatuqangit if we are going to be integrating it into the departments , the outpost camps are the ones who are living it .
they are practising everything using traditional knowledge .
i would like the outpost camps to be considered and i would like to urge the minister to work on it further .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
we truly believe in the inuit traditions .
it is always there when you are out on the land and funding outpost camps is one of the programs that we have kept going .
there are more outpost camps in the baffin area and we help them financially .
there is going to be a review done and like i said yesterday at the review next month we will get an update from the mayors in the communities and their representatives .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you minister .
we are on our second round of questions now for members .
mr. barnabas .
question 382 - 1 ( 3 ) :
proposed regional hospital
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i have not asked a question to my colleague mr. picco for quite a while now .
( interpretation ends ) going to the business incentive policy with the birthright corporations , there are some obstacles that have occurred .
i would like to know the location at the present time of the proposed regional hospital , i know that right now it is located right beside the present regional hospital .
but to my understanding there is a problem with the location because of the ntpc dam built right up there .
i would just like to know from the minister if there is an alternate location for the baffin regional hospital .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. barnabas .
minister responsible for health &amp; social services , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
it is adjacent to the current facility .
there is a concern , mr. speaker , with the dam , the ntpc dam that is above the current proposed site .
the first step then will be to do an investigation , engineering work to the proposed site .
that will be the next step .
we don &apos;t have an alternate site at the moment .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
oral questions .
mr. tootoo .
question 383 - 1 ( 3 ) :
clarification on optional leave policy
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question and it is more of a clarification , is for the minister responsible for human resources .
the statement refers to optional leave being available to excluded and managerial employees only .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister of finance , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
it is a government of nunavut proposal that is before the union and we haven &apos;t finalized the bargaining process , mr. speaker .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
supplementary mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i am not just sure if the minister can clarify it .
is this something that is being offered to all the employees , or is it something that the unionized employees will have to bargain for in order to get this offered to them .
or is it something offered to all employees or are they going to have to bargain for it .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , as i have indicated it is part of the government of nunavut &apos;s opening position .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i guess my question is again to the minister of human resources regarding the timing of this thing .
again , as i had indicated earlier during this session on the travel and stuff , or the living allowance increase that was available and then it wasn &apos;t .
this seems to be like something else that is put out there and made available to all employees .
i am just wondering why the minister is putting it out to excluded and managerial employees now and not waiting to see what becomes of the negotiations .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister responsible for human resources , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
that is why we continue to be at the table and try to work towards an agreement that is suitable for both parties , mr. speaker .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you minister .
final supplementary , mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i guess what i was wondering was as to the timing of it .
i realize that it is a positive thing and i remember when the mandatory donnie days were put in place this was something that i had talked about back then .
i know it was on the minds of a lot of government employees at the time about making it optional so people could take it when they choose .
again , this question is why all of a sudden these things are coming out and being offered to some employees and not to other until the collective agreement is signed .
i am just asking why now , instead of waiting until it was available to everybody .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister responsible for human resources , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :

question 384 - 1 ( 3 ) :
problems with time change
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i would like to direct my question to our premier .
last year we dealt with the time change and since then , three communities stayed on eastern standard time . i am still not finished with this issue until i get what i want .
have you seen any problems especially in the pangnirtung area .
their government offices and the hamlet council stayed on eastern standard time .
did you see any problems that occurred from the two different times that they were using in the community .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i know that it is evident that it is not going to be good for the staff .
our staff will have to work for nunavut and we have to give them support , so we will have to review this again .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. premier .
supplementary , mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
yes , i know that we do have nunavut government staff such as teachers and they went to the nunavut time along with the teachers , the nurses in sanikiluaq and pangnirtung .
mr. speaker , perhaps he can respond to my question because i was asking him if they have experienced any problems because of the time change .
thank you .
speaker :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the social services offices , especially in the baffin region will have to work with people , the public .
the hrdc have to work with the public too and if they are going to move to the nunavut time they have to work with the nunavut staff .
so we have to conform to all these well , so we will have to review them .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. premier .
supplementary , mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
you did not respond to my question .
my question was , since they did not change and they stayed on eastern standard time , did you see any problems occurring because of that .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
yes the community themselves chose to stay on the same hour and i would like to hear from these communities to see what kinds of problems occurred .
we will do another review some time in the near future and from my offices i can establish to review all the communities to see if they experienced any problems .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
final supplementary , mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question was , did you hear or see any problems from these three communities .
thank you , mr. speaker .

sealskin products
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na uqaqti .
april 1st has come and gone .
my question today is to the minister responsible for sustainable development .
can he confirm to me that all sealskin products that are being purchased in iqaluit and throughout nunavut , are harvested from nunavut .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
minister kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i cannot confirm today that all the clothing that people are wearing today are made in nunavut , or rather that the skins are bought in nunavut from nunavummiut .
i could not confirm that .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. minister .
supplementary , mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na uqaqti .
that puts a little bit of stress on me today , because i am sure that my family purchased this product hoping that the sealskin was harvested in nunavut to support nunavummiut .
could the minister consider in the future that products that are sold in our stores should have the place that they are made , whether it is nunavut or newfoundland or china .

thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
at this point in time i know of one skin tannery which had been operated in the past .
they were unable to pay their bills so more than once our staff have let us know they have tried to put money into the tannery programs .
as we speak , when we were reviewing the tannery programs in nunavut we were looking at how we can rectify the problems that kept occurring with the previous tanneries .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you minister .
mr. mclean , last question .
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na uqaqti .
if we are going to look at other communities and try to support this very important industry of sealing , i think we should be self-sufficient on it and support it .
will the minister commit to look at setting up a tannery in nunavut .

consideration of committee of the whole of bills and other matters
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
the committee will come to order .
we are dealing with the department of education main estimates .
i will ask the minister of education if he would like to go up to the witness table .
thank you mr. minister and your officials , welcome all .
while you are at the witness table , it would be best if there were only three at the witness tale at one time .
we have our pages that might have accidents if there are too many people up at the witness table .
we will proceed as smoothly as we can and discuss the issues at hand .
before we start , i would like you to introduce your officials .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
on my right is my deputy minister mr. bob moody and on my left we have the assistant deputy minister naullaq arnaquq .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
welcome all to the house for the committee of the whole .
before we begin , i believe you have opening comments to make .
mr. minister .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i will speak in english in regards to questions and clarification and the questions brought by two members .
when the 99 / 00 budget was prepared the department of education did not have its own financial staff .
the department of finance did most of the budget allocations for the department .
for example , one member wondered why on page 9-14 compensation and benefits went from 365 thousand to 3 million 368 thousand .
this was because we moved the social assistance program from the regional operation staff and the income support workers to this new field operation section .
so in general , all programs through the regional office were put in the new field operations section .
as well as moving them into this new section we correctly took them out of the grants and contributions and correctly put them into their proper categories of fees and payments and purchased services .
all of these necessary corrections were made this year and will not be required next year . the 1999 / 2000 main estimates have been re-stated by finance to include all of these movements .
re-organising our estimates in this fashion will help us in managing our budget .
i trust this note of explanation will assist members in understanding the nature of transfers within our budget .
mr. chairperson , in yesterday &apos;s session some honourable members noted that they were concerned that the education budget had not increased to the extent that they would have wished .
these funds could not be put in the department of education estimates earlier as the agreement was not ratified until after the estimates were compiled and printed .
members will recall that it was just yesterday that our minister of finance , the honourable kelvin ng , signed their agreement with the fnt .
preliminary figures for the department of finance and administration showed that the 6.5 million dollars additional to the education 2000 / 2001 will be as expended as follows .
salaries and allowances 2.7 million dollars ;
professional development 900 thousand ;
language proficiency 500 thousand ;
principal allowance and school operations 300 thousand ;
northern allowance 1.6 million dollars ;
relocation 500 thousand for a total of 6.5 million dollars .
all these components of the agreement are important for hardworking and deserving teachers in nunavut .
i &apos;m particularly pleased with the additional allowance provided with professional development and for language proficiency and mr. chairperson that is not all .
there will be other funds transferred to our department in amounts of several hundreds of thousands of dollars to cover increases in northern allowances for departmental staff once the new rates are set .
mr. chairperson , in closing i know members will appreciate that together these 2 items will add almost 7 million dollars to 2000 / 2001 estimates to the department of education now before you .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister arvaluk .
at this time we will go ahead and go back to the issues we were dealing with yesterday .
did you want to make a comment mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
just a question .
when the students buy their graduation dresses do they get to keep their graduation suits .
also why are the schools not used in the summer time , when they could be used as a day-care facility or provide some other services .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. barnabas .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
probably i will answer the last question .
the decs and the deas operate the schools ;
it is up to the discretion of those local authorities how the schools could be used in the summer .
so it is up to the deas on how the schools can be used .
in response to the dresses and gowns , i will let naullaq answer your question .
ms. arnaquq :
from what i know the schools make their own arrangements .
they order their graduation gowns and sometimes the schools make their own .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
i will complete my statement .
we are dealing with bill 13 and tabled documents 41-1 ( 3 ) , 51-1 ( 3 ) and tabled documents 60-1 ( 3 ) and 61-1 ( 3 ) .
we will be dealing with these bills and tabled documents .
mr. barnabas would you like to make a further comment .
mr. iqaqrialu any general comments .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
first of all the divisional boards are going to dissolved on july 1 .
my first question is in regards to the deas .
how much authority are you going to give them since the divisional boards are going to be dissolved .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
for example , take on more financial duties or if they are going to be taking on more hiring .
for example , i would ask the deas if they would like to take on the authorities that were previously held by the divisional boards .
we will have individual negotiations with the local deas .
i do know that some of the deas are more advanced than others .
they will take on more responsibility .
we will keep it open .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairperson .
the minister did mention the deas are free if they would like to take on more financial responsibilities .
i was wondering if your finance controller is going to be taking care of all your finances going to the communities .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
we would like to do that in the baffin especially .
there is inadequate training provided in financial services .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. iqaqrialu
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
so you have already responded to the third question that i was to ask .
however , the hamlets and the deas are some of the interests in the communities .
are the deas going to be operating without the support of the hamlet councils .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
yes , they will be operating on their own .
we are going to be setting up some policies but we are considering the students will benefit more if they are under one entity .
it may get confusing if there are too many bodies who are responsible for education .
they will be on their own without the help of the hamlet .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you for your response .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
who is going to be responsible for the contracts . is it going to be the deas or is it going to be the minister &apos;s department .
i would like clarification on this point .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. minister .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
yes there are going to be two types of contracts .
there is one that will be nunavut wide or one if you are operating regionally .
they will be the responsibility of the department of education .
if it is going to be in the community then it is going to be the deas responsibility .
we will negotiate and see if they would like to do that .
for example if they are going to be getting an instructor responsible for cultural programs we can let the communities take on that responsibility after discussions with the department of education .
if the communities wish to take on additional responsibilities , they will have to seek approval from the minister and there would be an agreement signed between the two entities .
we are proposing our sole responsibility will be the students .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr arvaluk .
mr. iqaqrialu your next question .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
in the communities , since the deas are going to be working with department of education .
i have read the education act and the communities are going to be working with the department of education .
is that true .
thank you mr. chairman
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
of course , once a government makes a decision it has to be followed especially with the policies .
sometimes it is hard when there is no money to implement the decisions .
the communities will have employees in the baffin , kitikmeot and the keewatin .
using the baffin as an example , they are going to be moving to pond inlet .
once they move they are going to still be our employees if that is going to be set-up the communities are going to negotiate directly with the minister .
if they have directives they do not have to go through the minister , but they could work with the department of education &apos;s employees .
we have to be well aware of that .
it will not be very good if they want to set up an office and go directly to the minister .
we have staff who deal with such issues . if it were a grey area , they would go directly to the minister .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
we are looking at the document that was written .
the minister is going to be responsible for a huge task .
he has many responsibilities and i know we are not going to be meeting here in iqaluit all the time .
i know for sure that we are not going to be holding our session here in iqaluit all the time .
so , i was wondering we might lose the minister at times he might be absent travelling and we would not be able to find him .
the communities would have to have direct negotiations with the minister .
i think a problem that may occur with that is the minister may be too busy and have no time for the community to have direct negotiations with him .
so what are your alternative options .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
i want the member to understand that having a direct negotiation with the minister means that you can have a direct negotiation with the minister .
the department sometimes receives one hundred documents a day .
the staffs &apos; job is to find out which one is the priority of the minister and which requires a meeting .
so therefore the staff , although i am travelling around to the other communities , the staff always stays behind to take care of the department .
we have a number of staff in our department and they can inform me right away because the staff knows where i am at all times .
also they could tell me when there is an urgent case , like for example something in clyde river and we need to talk with them so my staff would advise me .
i do not see any problems occurring with the direct contact from the communities .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
that is the way i understand it in the inuktitut language .
perhaps we need a new term in inuktitut .
that way we can understand what the minister has stated .
like for example if they want to have direct contact with the department we need a better inuktitut term .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. minister .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
mr. chairperson i think it is this way ;
the district education council &apos;s staff if they did not know how to respond to a community &apos;s request i would have the dec call my office .
once they call my office , my staff would answer the telephone ooleena naudlaq , my secretary and my assistant and my assistant deputy minister are usually around .
so the community could call them and request to speak to the minister .
we do have a 1-800 number at the legislative assembly .
they could call me through there .
they could connect to that number according to who they wanted to speak to .
in inuktitut that means the community will have the opportunity to have direct contact with the minister , especially the deas , if they go through the proper steps .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu and the minister for answering those questions .
mr. tootoo it is your turn now .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman the minister talked about adding another 6.5 million dollars to his budget and i was wondering if he could provide the summary of where it was all going .
i missed the summary and i also missed where he said the dollars were coming from .
i would just ask him to clarify that .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
we can provide an explanation during the committee of the whole meeting .
secondly , to finance 6.5 million dollars , this comes from the department of finance and administration .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i don &apos;t know whether the minister of education can answer me or not .
was that coming out of the 15 million dollar contingency reserve that was set aside or is that coming form other areas .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
thank you .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairperson .
i am not the minister of finance i think you will have to wait until the minister of finance is on the stand .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
general comments .
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman i would like to get clarification .
just recently it became evident that i had to help a student buy groceries because that student has a child .
i was wondering if the student financial support is going to be increased .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. barnabas .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk we are reviewing these two programs and after that i will be requesting a report .
perhaps by september or october i will have the results by those dates for the income support program and for the student financial support program .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairman ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister for education .
thank you .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na uqaqti .
i will just do general comments mr. minister and i really do not need an answer .
so it is consistent right across the board .
i know in some communities that the types of accounting and paperwork are completely different .
my other concern is we have arctic college in every community .
years ago there used to be a co-ordinated approach for training .
there used to be feedback between deas and arctic college .
i think the deas and the community learning centres have to work closer together .
so i hope there is a co-ordinated approach and that they are not confused with each other .
there is not a reluctance to work with each other .
there is a bit of confusion there for them to work with each other .
student teacher ratio . i know it is around a 22 to 1 ratio .
i know for a fact in the elementary ends in a lot the schools in the kivalliq that the ratio is around 30 to 1 .
i do not want to be negative about this .
i put no blame on the department .
in kindergarten to grade six , there is such different learning in a lot of the communities .
so the kids that are at the grade level , i think suffer substantially because they are not challenged more .
i know you live in a community and have probably identified that too .
on the other hand , the teachers are burnt out .
in the most cases the elementary school teacher turnover is probably pretty high .
but they are a dedicated lot . they are a dedicated group of teachers .
but i see they are starting to get tired looking after 30 kids a day in their classrooms .
like i say i think you as a parent in nunavut realize that as much as i do .
now getting into the grade 7 to 12 end .
in my tours around high schools , like you when we went to school we had to go to school five days a week .
whether we liked to or not . i know education has changed but has it changed that much where students get 3 days off and the parents are confused .
because being in the dea again i listen to parents &apos; concerns that i do not know when my kids go to school anymore .
they have 10 or 15 spares a week .
i have heard that from the private sector .
what are we doing in the high schools in the keewatin .
but are we concentrating on what are the basics to learning .
computers , reading and writing .
i think if we can read in our schools then they will be able to comprehend what we are teaching them .
so those are my general comments james .
it is probably the things you have heard from your constituents .
but i think we have to concentrate on teaching in the schools rather than all the fluffy stuff .
computers are great .
we need the computers .
you know we need the cultural stuff .
but only so much of it .
you know i am a firm believer that the culture stuff should be taught out on the land .
but we do have programs in the schools that teach it .
professional development .
i know you have only been in the job for a year .
i have been asking about professional development for teachers in the schools and i think it is being done .
i thinks it is not visible enough yet .
the response to me is no .
it is too hard .
it is too hard .
that scares me .
if we can not attract young people in our communities to maybe look at the teaching profession then i do not know if we are going forward or not .
because there is a lot of work .
i think the rewards are when you see kids later , teachers see kids doing well .
so those are just my general comments james .
that is all i have to say today .
ma &apos;na uqaqti .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. mclean .
there is no question .
it is just a general comment .
comments about his views on education .
mr. minister do you have a response .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
if i make a mistake let me know .
in the page we were dealing with yesterday i think the minister was talking about gnwt &apos;s funding to be used for daycares .
he said there was some funding left over and the nunavut government had requested funds that were not used from the gnwt .
i know the money will be used for a good purpose but then they will be all be spent soon .
if that money is spent where would we be able to get some more funding as a nunavut government .
that is the question mr. chairman .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
minister arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
we had planned in the main estimates that there would be some funds for that purpose if he can wait for that page .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. iqaqrialu will be able to ask that question when the time comes .
the first person that i recognize is mr. havioyak .
mr. havioyak :
thank you mr. chairman .
i would like to comment on the issue of arctic college adult education .
i am sure the department has looked at these ones before .
i just want to mention for the record that today going to adult education to the bigger centres is not working well i think .
i am sure it was stated yesterday .
but i just wanted to bring that up again by saying i think the community based training programs will work better if there were put in each community .
because today we have young people going to schools and not completing because they get homesick and because of other things because it is a new community to adjust to .
in the future it should be considered very seriously having a community based training program .
for example mechanics , apprentice carpenters and so on .
i think those should be looked at more closely in the very near future so we could have more trained people in the trades areas .
i just wanted to mention that has to be looked at very seriously .
because i know communities across nunavut are looking at those types of training and hopefully education will look at that .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. havioyak .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i understand the members concern .
( interpretation ends ) i understand the concern and respect the idea at least the recommendation .
as the minister of education i have joined the minister of sustainable development to prepare a discussion paper on mining development in nunavut .
that builds on the bathurst principle inuuqatigirttiarni amma narminiq .
this will ensure that mining investment is possible in nunavut communities .
this would include in to the planning stage for trades programs .
then we will be able to advise you better .

chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
the next speaker is mr. irqittuq
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
not too many questions coming from me , the questions that i asked yesterday i will not be asking them again .
the concerns that i have in regards to the department of education i will mention .
the first one is when i was campaigning to become a member of the legislative assembly i campaigned about education .
there are many people in my community and my constituency that have dropped out of schools and are relying on income support .
they do not go out hunting and they are too old to go back to school .
we have an arctic college in my community and that could be utilized by adult students but there is not enough room in that college and it is not utilized by very many people .
the young people or those ones in between are not educated in regards to traditional hunting and they are not educated enough in the modern sense .
they want to go to school also they want to go out hunting but they do not have the clothing to go out hunting and they have not been taught to go out hunting .
i asked those questions to the past minister and asked him what are they going to be doing about it .
i directed it to the minister of culture , language , elders &amp; youth but i never got an adequate response .
now i am turning this question to the minister of education and he understands where i am coming from .
i do not believe that he wanted to make an appropriate response because of the lack of funds .
i know that we will need to use a substantial amount of money in order to do it but the response was not all people can be teachers .
not all elders can be teachers .
the only response he made was not all people can be teachers .
i do know that is true .
but the 26 nunavut communities do have people who could be teachers or instructors .
if we look , we will find them .
i just wanted to make that statement again .
we have to get it going because of the comments i have made .
i know i only have 10 minutes .
however , today igloolik and hall beach are very close together and people who do not go out very often sometimes travel from my community to igloolik without a qamotiq .
once a blizzard comes up , they get lost .
a search and rescue party has to go look for them .
there have been many times in previous years we have had to look for people who have left without a qamutiq or supplies .
they can not read the weather patterns .
in my community it is very different .
it is not like iqaluit .
it is so flat that you can go from ice to land without realising it .
the kids or the people are not being taught about survival skills and i believe there has to be money set aside so that we can teach these people .
we have to teach them survival skills .
there are many people who are in the workforce now that are parents in the workforce .
the children of these parents are just going to school because they have to because it is mandatory because they have to go .
but they are not being taught survival skills or land skills .
we do not keep our children all day .
they are in school and when they are not in school it is the parents that are working .
it has to become one of the programs that should be set up in the school system .
things that a full time hunter would know .
when you are a hunter there has to be many things you have to do on a daily basis .
repairing equipment , going hunting .
when you are a full time hunter , it is a full time job .
this is one program that i would like to see in the school system .
he was brought up in an outpost camp before he started school .
he knows a lot more on survival skills than i do and i do not like his response saying that everybody cannot be instructors or teachers .
i can only say that he made that response because he does not have the funds to set up those types of programs .
for women or girls there are instructors that are available and i will work very hard to see these types of programs set up in the schools .
we might try hall beach or igloolik as a pilot project where that type of program would be set up .
that is my first comment that i wanted to make .
secondly , how many minutes do i have .
my last comment .
today our students in my community i am not putting them down but i hear that they are following the alberta curriculum .
however , in my community the language instruction is weak .
if i go to igloolik it is a stronger education system in igloolik more so than hall beach .
i have a daughter who will be completing grade 12 this spring .
she can not even speak english properly or does not speak as much english as mr. arvaluk .
i am sure i do not know about james but he might not have completed grade 12 and she speaks less english than he does .
i do not speak very much english but there are some things in english that she can not understand .
she can not even read properly .
if english is going to be used as a language of instruction then i would very strongly suggest that they do follow the alberta curriculum the way it is supposed to be used .
if a grade 10 student from hall beach went down to alberta , the student would probably drop out because of the huge gap between hall beach and alberta .
there has to be something done about it .
the federal government is very wise .
i am not putting them down but they could be deceiving .
looking at james arvaluk , john elupalik , my other brother jack qammuqaq , looking at the first set of children who went to school with me .
my grandmother did not want me to go to school .
the people who went to school in the 50 &apos;s and 60 &apos;s are leaders of today .
these people are very smart .
i think that the federal government lowered the education system so we do not advance .
i am thinking like that .
we have to do something about the education system .
if we are going to teach inuktitut and writing then teach them properly .
but keep english and inuktitut separate .
i wanted to make those comments .
last in regards to the main estimates .
as you know there are other communities that are more in need than my community but i do want to help my community because i am representing them .
what i would like to see is the blueprints of the hall beach school completed and i will be asking for support from the other members so that the blueprints can be completed .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq for your presentation .
mr. minister did you want to respond to some of the comments that mr. irqittuq made .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
in regards to the college we have already taken just about all of them into consideration and we have agreed .
we do not disagree with the member but we have to remember for example , if he looked at the divisional board , he could look at what is available for adults .
his comments were to me but he could read documents that show where the elders can be utilized .
there are many responses to his questions and i would probably have to take an hour to respond to them .
that is what we are starting to do so that those people who are willing will work instead .
we want the elders to be full participants in all this .
i do not want to say that they cannot be teachers but they have to be certified .
the elders would be very , very proud if they were certified , there are some very capable instructors and there are some that specialize .
like you said i was brought up in an outpost camp and there are some people who know how to do it but they cannot teach .
i am not saying that the elders are not capable but the elders can specialize in two or three certain topics .
i am not arguing with the member .
lastly , something that mr. iqaqrialu touched upon , the education act also says in there how the elders could be integrated into the school system .
when they go into high school and it does not look like they can pass the alberta curriculum then there is something wrong , whether it is in hall beach or wherever .
possibly the student teacher ratio does not match or ... we have to look at what the problem is if the student cannot complete or pass the alberta curriculum .
the curriculum is all set there .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
yes , i understand his response and his comments .
one thing that the minister kept saying is that he could take up to an hour to respond .
i understand that it would not take that long to respond .
you can only respond with the money .
if we get some dollars to hire staff then that &apos;s okay .
in addition , if we only use english as our language of instruction then we would teach them english .
we do not necessarily have to have official education .
for example , as a hunter and i become an instructor i would know that i would have to go hunting at a particular time of day .
as a hunter i would not use the working hours , i would depend on the weather .
however , one thing that creates a problem is that i know that the elder would have daily work , he would be busy .
perhaps naullaq can respond to me .
i think that is what i understand in inuktitut , if they have inuktitut as a language of instruction but it is just being tested .
perhaps this is creating a problem or hindering the students from learning english .
so i have heard that this was a test .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
as an instructor i would have to know all that , i cannot just let them watch me and expect them to learn from watching automatically . that is just an example .
if we were going to be teaching social issues , family planning , wouldn &apos;t we be speaking in inuktitut .
so we are reviewing these . if we instruct them in inuktitut wouldn &apos;t it be better for the student .
thank you mr. chairman . chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman . i do not think he understood me clearly .
i think my community of hall beach has been used as a testing ground . naullaq has been working in the education field for quite some time now .
i think my community was used as a testing ground . i think they taught grade 5 students , from kindergarten to grade 5 , in the inuktitut language .
i was not talking about survivor skills . perhaps she can elaborate to us as to what happened in hall beach .
thank you mr. chairman . in regards to your comment , that has happened in the past .
i think it was stopped shortly after it was initiated . i would have heard about it in our office whether it is being used or not .
i just wanted to clarify and make those points since we will be dealing with them this spring .
ntep students are taught to become certified teachers , i was given a note , and perhaps you are talking about ntep students who are graduating .
when they will be using inuktitut language in their instruction .
is that what you are talking about .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. arnaquq .
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
they are only taught in the inuktitut language writing and reading .
i think when they go to grade 6 they are only taught english .
i think that is how it is today still .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i think we should be getting back to the item that we are here to discuss .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
they will respond to mr. irqittuq on his question .
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i enjoyed the comments by the member mr. irqittuq .
first of all the business of having inuit teachers is very nice to hear especially for the inuit teachers to be able to be teaching in the schools .
there are a lot more inuit teachers who have been teaching in my community and it is good to see that .
i would like to thank the department of education for providing that and for teaching the inuit to become teachers .
there are a lot more students that are going into high school and able to get certificates .
this year there were ... audio unavailable ...
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. akesuk .
ms. arnaquq .
ms. arnaquq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i think the member was asking , i cannot really find out right now because i cannot find the page .
perhaps maybe we can get back to the member and respond to him .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. arnaquq .
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
these are some of the questions that i had , i think they could be responded to at the appropriate time .
how many teachers have certificates and how many students have received a diploma and how many inuit principals are there and how many principals are trying to retain their certificates .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. akesuk .
minister of education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
it is during the fourth year right now , so after they finish that year then they will be high school teachers .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
he is eager to get up into the committee of the whole i guess .
thank you mr. chairman .
i would just ask the minister what is the norm , or the number that the department has that it wants .
what standard has it set for itself that it wants to be at and is that different than what is actually is right now .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
right now we have for example , for the full time equivalency tables , i will just start with 101 .
if you have 101 students , you are allowed to have 5.0 teachers . one hundred and thirteen 4.5 and they are all different all the way down to 473 to 21.5 .
if you have 483 plus students , the ratio would be 22 to 1 .
so it is not fixed to anything until you get to 483 , then it becomes consistent with 22.1 .
so this is only kindergarten to grade nine .
for example , if you don &apos;t have a big lab , you cannot really take 25 .
so in a high school situation it is a little bit more complicated .
but i answered the member the other day that we want to simplify this so that it becomes more complicated ...
&gt; &gt; laughter
... we want to simplify it so that it can complement more of the reality of what is required for a classroom size .
it really depends on the subject .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
maybe i should ask the honourable member from iqaluit east .
what is it at and then is there somewhere a standard that we want to try , not necessarily that we are at but what we want to try to achieve .
i &apos;ll just leave it at that for now .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. minister .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
we are trying to use 22 to 1 for our average size classroom .
but it is really wide depending on what community you come from too . what has been allocated in the formula for your community and what is the grade levels in your own school .
sometimes you will have six grade 9 &apos;s and have eleven grade 10 &apos;s , do you have two teachers then .
no .
the guideline is 22 to 1 .
for the policy development purposes i would like bob to explain a little bit more .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. moody .
mr. moody :
two comments , mr. chairman , thank you .
i guess just to first reiterate a comment that the minister made .
in actuality , the pupil teacher ratio does vary quite widely across nunavut , both in the earlier years and in high school .
as the honourable member would know for here in iqaluit , the pupil teacher ratio in our elementary schools is higher than we would like to see it .
it is a challenge , whereas in apex , just by the way the numbers work out , the pupil teacher ratio is quite favourable , something we would like to see more of .
i guess there are two issues associated on the policy side .
so it is not a magic formula .
nakurmiik umalu taima .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. moody .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
because i think that anyone would agree that once classes get over a certain size , you are not really teaching it is more like babysitting .
there is a big difference and i am just wondering if they are looking at trying to identify reasons why this is occurring .
are they doing a study or trying to find out why we are seeing such a discrepancy from the elementary to the high school levels .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
using the ratio of 20 to 1 , the principals are charged with allocating classroom sizes and classrooms , for individual schools .
unfortunately sometimes the principals in some particular schools aren &apos;t as experienced in allocating classrooms and classroom sizes .
for the other part , i would like to ask the chairman if naullaq could answer that part .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .

minister &apos;s statement 103 - 1 ( 3 ) :
departmental inuit qaujimajatuqangit initiatives
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
in february an inuit qaujimajatuqangit committee was formed within my department representing staff from all divisions and regional offices of public works and services .
the committee &apos;s mandate also includes the use of inuit qaujimajatuqangit to enhance wellness for our staff in the work place .
public works and services has identified five key principles to guide its work in implementing inuit qaujimajatuqangit .
pijitsirniq-encouraging knowledge and ability based leadership and serving the interest of the community ;
aajiiqatigiiniq-understanding each other and working together for a common purpose ,
pilimmaksarniq-developing skills and knowledge through observation and practice ,
qanuqtuurunnarniq-improving where necessary and maximizing the use of limited resources ,
and inuqatigiitiarniq-creating a healthy work environment that encourages living in harmony and having fun .
mr. speaker , through their hard work the committee successfully developed a strategy for inuit qaujimajatuqangit and the department has already begun to put this strategy in to action .
where required these words or phrases are translated into the regional dialects for staff in our regional offices .
some of the initiatives the department has planned to implement for the coming months include ;
consulting with our elders on ways to incorporate traditional ways and knowledge in the programs and services we provide .
inviting elders to visit the offices of the department to talk to employees about culture , history and legends as well as to learn about the operations of the department .
setting up traditional displays of inuit artwork and traditional tools in the entrance areas of our buildings to promote northern images for visitors to our offices .
mr. speaker the departmental inuit qaujimajatuqangit committee noted the linkages between inuit qaujimajatuqangit and the principles of inuit employment plans .
as a result , public works and services will be using inuit qaujimajatuqangit as a tool to assist in hiring and retaining inuit employees .
initiatives in this area include creating job shadowing opportunities where students visiting the department &apos;s offices for a day to observe staff on the job and learn about possible career options .
mr. speaker , my department has also sent letters to young nunavummiut in the south who are studying engineering and other trades specific to public works and services .
we are informing them of summer employment opportunities that could help enhance their work experience and future employment options here in nunavut .
with the departmental inuit qaujimajatuqangit policy in place the public works and services inuit qaujimajatuqangit committee is now in the process of communicating the strategy and it &apos;s objectives to managers throughout the department .
managers will be responsible for reporting on the progress of these initiatives on a quarterly basis .
mr. speaker , i am very proud of public works and services accomplishments to date in the area of inuit qaujimajatuqangit .
i look forward to updating the members of the house the progress of the inuit qaujimajatuqangit initiatives that public works and services has planned for the upcoming months .
thank you , mr. speaker .

minister &apos;s statement 104 - 1 ( 3 ) :
wildlife research projects
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i am tabling later today the first ever summary of wildlife research projects in nunavut .
this research is conducted by the department of sustainable development scientists and technicians .
that along with inuit qaujimajatuqangit provides the basis for wildlife management decisions in nunavut .
mr. speaker we are at a critical period in our history when our environment is changing and when we have the ability to change our environment .
within nunavut our population is growing , development is increasing , technology is extending , the distances we can travel and the efficiency with which we harvest .
activities elsewhere in the world are affecting our environment and our wildlife in nunavut .
we are only just beginning to understand the effects these changes may be having on the natural cycles that have sustained our wildlife over thousands of years .
this is the co-management regime that i work with as minister of sustainable development .
mr. speaker , i have a deep commitment to managing a wildlife management system in nunavut that is governed by the principles that inuit have lived by throughout their history .
i trust members will find it a useful reference when people in their constituencies want information about our governments wildlife research activities .
thank you , mr. speaker .

qikiqtarjuaq clam divers
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker i rise today to read a document that was sent to me from the qikiqtarjuaq clam divers , it reads :
mr. iqaqrialu , you are the representative for your constituency at the legislative assembly .
those of us who are clam divers in qikiqtarjuaq would like to request support from you .
in october 1998 , we took a course in iqaluit for a whole week , once we completed the course we were given diver &apos;s certification .
they gave us plastic cards and certified that we were the marine divers .
once we completed our course , we were told that we could harvest clams by way of diving and we were very happy .
however , an inspector declared that our diver &apos;s certification was a recreational diver &apos;s certification .
we were also informed that our lack of insurance for commercial diving was a problem .
therefore , we are requesting support for higher training course on diving to achieve commercial divers status .
we love to dive and we want to continue and be successful .
we thank each and every one of the members of the legislative assembly and may god bless you .
thank you from davidee koonelusie , charlie aliqatuktuk , isaac audlakiak , noah qiutaam .
i will be asking questions in regards to this issue during the question period .

gjoa haven office opening
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i heard the interpreter &apos;s say okalik so i did not think you were saying mr. puqiqnak .
i would like to apologize to my constituency that i am unable to be in my community during the opening ceremony of the government office in gjoa haven .
as the legislative assembly is sitting at this time dealing with the main estimates , it is very important that i be here at the session .
when we deal with the main estimates i would like to represent my constituency well during the main estimates session .
mr. speaker the new gjoa haven office had just opened today and i know that it is very important for decentralization and we are proud that the office was built there .
it shows that the government is proceeding and succeeding with decentralization in the communities which will provide more job opportunities in the communities such as gjoa haven .

member &apos;s statement 275 - 1 ( 3 ) :
iqaluit teachers
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker i was extremely disturbed to hear a report on the radio this morning that suggested that iqaluit had too many teachers .
mr. speaker it should go without saying that communities and schools cannot have too many teachers .
that &apos;s like saying students are too well educated , or that communities are too healthy .
i can &apos;t imagine that there is a single parent in this community or any other community who would think that their children &apos;s schools have too many teachers .
mr. speaker i understand that iqaluit has over a hundred new students since this past fall alone .
by the fall of this year that number may be over a one hundred and seventy new students .
the current formula is hardly magical or perfect for example there are 29 kindergarten students at joamie elementary school .
this is only considered as 14.5 ftes that is what they are funded on .
but next year when the students move into grade 1 the formula will ignore the fact that are actually 29 students in the classroom not the 14.5 ftes they are funded for .
mr. speaker i fully support the minister of education &apos;s commitment to review the formula .
while iqaluit may have more teachers than the formula allows this ignores the fact that there are over 120 more students than the formula took into consideration last fall .
this situation is hardly unique to iqaluit as it is my understanding that there are schools throughout nunavut that have more teachers than the formula strictly permits .
thank you , mr. speaker .

member &apos;s comments on killiniq high school
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker i ask for the indulgence from the members for my statement may be over the allotted time .
yesterday , mr. speaker the member for iqaluit centre made a statement on meeting basic needs and fairness .
mr. speaker , i believe that the honourable member &apos;s comments are targeted towards the killiniq high school project in cambridge bay .
mr. speaker i am compelled to respond on behalf of my constituents and quite frankly i thought about listing facility by facility , school by school , what are government funds here in iqaluit .
but no , i don &apos;t begrudge what the town of iqaluit has in respect to the many facilities it has as i know there is a need for those facilities .
otherwise why would they be there .
mr. speaker i have with me a file of correspondence , letters dating back to september of 1998 one month after the killiniq high school burned to the ground .
letters from the hamlet council , the local education authority the kitikmeot heritage society signed by 10 of our elders , the killiniq high school principal and letters from myself as the mla .
mr. moody , mr. irniq , the office of the interim commissioner including the interim commissioner himself .
i also have a resolution in this file from the kitikmeot leader &apos;s forum dated in october of 1998 supporting the large gym as part of the replacement project .
later i &apos;ll table this resolution and the letter from the heritage society which is addressed to the minister havioyak in both english and innuinaqtut .
all of these pieces of correspondence mr. speaker substantiate the need for a full-sized gymnasium and a cultural heritage centre .
mr. speaker i seek unanimous consent to conclude my statement .
speaker :
proceed mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you honourable members .
mr. speaker , i &apos;ll speak briefly about the full-sized gym .
there is a request for a hundred additional square metres estimated at $ 395 thousand dollars with the hamlet contributing 20 % of the funding .
originally it was 293 additional metres which included the enhanced change room , gym office , enhanced storage , the stage etc. for the full size gym .
this was all given up by the municipality in trying to make the project more viable , in trying to accommodate the government of nunavut .
the main reason for the request for the full size gym is that there is no full size gym in the kitikmeot at all to allow for regional or territorial athletic or cultural events .
mr. speaker , the heritage and the cultural centre , the request is for 200 additional square meters estimated at approximately at 525 thousand .
the kitikmeot heritage society itself as of today has 85 thousand dollars today sitting in a bank account to contribute to this project .
that is how committed they are to it .
the school that burnt down had a community library and a heritage and cultural centre as part of their structure .
it displayed artifacts , they ran cultural programs such as drum making , tool making , story telling , traditional clothing making .
elders taught these programs to students and to the public at large .
this was all developed outside of gnwt policies at the time due to the strong community support .
in cambridge bay the traditional cultural ties are probably the weakest in nunavut through no fault of the residents of the community .
you only have to look at the history of the community mr. speaker .
it was established as a dew line site .
it was a ministry of transport centre and then subsequently a gnwt regional office .
there was a strong presence by health and welfare canada , the rcmp and other federal agencies .
there was a strong outside influence on the community and around its residents .
the community recognises this mr. speaker .
over the past eight to ten years they have made a concerted effort to strengthen cultural , language , and traditional community knowledge .
initiatives such as establishing the heritage society , an elders committee , accessing funding from federal programs etc . , to pursue these initiatives are proof of these efforts .
i want to read briefly mr. speaker , an excerpt from a letter addressed to the former minister havioyak signed by ten elders .
quote &quot; this partnership has allowed our organization to create a facility that truly promotes learning at all ages by all people in the community regardless of their ability to read or write .
this will be a place for newcomers to learn about inuit culture and language first hand from the elders .
this will be a place for elders to mix with youth from the high school , a place where both groups will have a sense of belonging .
this will be a place where children will come to understand their past and why it is important to hold on to their culture through their language .
this will be a place where people will love to learn . &quot;
their closing sentence of that same letter , mr. speaker :
&quot; we hope that you will continue to listen and will understand the value to our community of such a facility for the short and long term . &quot;
mr. speaker in closing , the community elders that are actively involved in strengthening their language , their cultural and traditional knowledge , should not be penalized for their efforts .
they should be commended and supported in their efforts mr. speaker .
to me that is the nunavut way .
thank you mr. speaker .

lack of representative government
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i had my hand up quite a while mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i rise today ... i do not have any sport stories like other members but i have a concern i want to let the members know about .
i will talk about the concerns of the two communities that i represent .
we were very happy to get a nunavut government because it would be for all people of nunavut .
but after the government started operating the people , especially with the time zone change voiced some concerns .
my community has told me about the nunavut day holiday in that they do not want to take the first monday in august .
the community that i represent had great hope when we first started campaigning for the nunavut government , people said that the government of nunavut would be for all the people of nunavut .
the government of nunavut is following some of that , but some are not .
they are not fully representing the people .
this government is not really listening to the people .
so today i rise mr. speaker , to say we have to remember that we have to represent our people and we have to listen to them , to their wishes .
we have to work together and we have to also represent the people that voted us in here , because we have to follow their wishes .
thank you mr. speaker .

i would like to take this opportunity to announce to this house and the people of iqaluit east that there is a change of location and times for my constituency office .
mr. speaker , as of monday april 3 , i have opened a new office in beautiful apex to help serve the constituents there .
mr. speaker , the apex office at the present time is operating from house 3236 .
i am trying to secure permanent office space in apex but in the meantime mr. speaker , the apex office will be open 9 to 12 , monday through friday .
our current constituency office located across from the navigator will continue to be open from 1 to 5 monday through friday to serve residents here in town .
mr. speaker , operating both of these offices is a person who has been with me since day one as my representative in iqaluit .
oonga henderson was born and raised in iqaluit and will operate the apex office from her home for now and will staff the iqaluit office across from the navigator every afternoon .
oonga has worked very hard for me and the people of iqaluit and now mr. speaker , iqaluit east .
oonga exemplifies what iqaluit people are well known for and that is honesty , hard work and mr. speaker and being very friendly .
i would like to take this opportunity to thank oonga .
mr. speaker , during house sittings and sessions i can be reached either through the apex or iqaluit office or directly here at the legislative assembly .

qikiqtarjuaq clam divers
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , perhaps i will be directing my question to the minister of sustainable development .
some people in qikiqtarjuaq as i said before , are clam divers and they lost their opportunity to make some money when the government shut down their operation .
i also raised this question during our rankin inlet session and i just want to ask the minister what the status of that is right now .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister kilabuk do you care to answer the question .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :

i was not sure which minister would respond to this .
my staff in the department have been addressing some of the concerns that have been raised and i have asked one of my officials to look into this concern of the member .
however , we do not have the exact time when these divers can take further training in clam diving and i understand the workers &apos; compensation board put a stop to their diving .
i am in support of those clam divers and we will do everything we can to assist the community .
i will keep the member informed as to the status of what we are doing within our department regarding the clam divers .

funding transfer to the department of education
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , my question is for the minister of finance .
yesterday , the minister of education indicated in committee of the whole that there was 6.5 million dollars that was going to be transferred from the department of finance to the department of education .
i would like to ask the minister of finance if those funds , the 6.5 million is part of the 10 million dollar contingency reserve that he talked about in his budget address .
thank you mr. speaker .

minister ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
yes .

supplementary , mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , in the budget address it said to accommodate additional expenditure requirements he set aside that 10 million dollar reserve and it seems apparent that already 6.5 million is gone .
i would like to ask the minister of finance , if he has or if the government has any more of the 3.5 million left remaining earmarked for any other purpose .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister responsible for finance , mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , we also have you may recall 5 million dollars set aside for a northern allowance adjustment .
so other than that there is nothing anticipated given that we have to await the outcome of the northern employees &apos; union negotiations because there may be additional costs .
we do not know that until agreements are reached and than ratified by both parties .
so those are the ones that i can think of off hand mr. speaker . thank you .

mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i will be directing my question to the premier .
mr. speaker , earlier today i stated that we should be listening to the elders &apos; wishes .
for that very reason yesterday i asked the premier a question but he never really responded to my question .
so i will pose the same question by rephrasing it .
i know that the communities with decentralization are now proceeding today , perhaps he could respond to me today .
i know that we have staff in the communities , the nurses , the rcmp and the teachers who all work in the communities .
i was trying to ask him if they had encountered any problems to date with the time change .

hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :

oral questions .
mr. barnabas .
question 390 - 1 ( 3 ) :
time change effects
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , although it was asked previously by my colleague i would like to rephrase the question to the premier , since he is responsible for decentralization .
mr. speaker , the three communities of pangnirtung , sanikiluaq and clyde river are still on eastern standard time while the rest of the communities are on central time which is called nunavut time .
for example , lunch hour if the wife is going by eastern standard time and her husband is working on nunavut time , their lunch hour differs .
the spouses would have to go for lunch at different times and this creates a problem .
so i was wondering what the premier is going to do about it .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. premier if you would like to respond to that question please .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
perhaps they will have to get a divorce .
i am just joking .
yes , it is time that we will start reviewing this on how we can improve it and we will look at ways that we can improve it .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
supplementary mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
for that very reason we are talking about the single time zone because my colleague mr. irqittuq had asked about it .
the premier had said that he would review this matter , and although two of those communities did not receive decentralization , one of the communities has received decentralization .
so i was wondering if they do not change the time , will the nunavut government withhold these job opportunities unless they change to nunavut time .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
at this time we are reviewing this and the pangnirtung mla will be going to pangnirtung to hear the concerns of the people .
this is being dealt with right now .

i am not sure , i would like to be able to know whether there could be a mental health worker in each community .
i know that in one of my constituent towns they have a women &apos;s group and they deal with people that have problems .
i gave them my appreciation for helping out and helping people that are under a lot of stress .
the young people have a need for someone to talk to when they have problems .
is there a place where the young people can go or a group that they can approach when they have problems or when they have a lot of stress to talk to people .
is there a group or a body that is in the community that can be accessed by those young people that are encountering problems .
a lot of people would want that , is that in existence right now where we could go and approach somebody to talk to them about wanting some help .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , this is a very important question and it lends itself to a detailed answer .
i will try mr. speaker , to make it succinct and keep my reply short .
in most cases , education through our school system does have community counsellors who are available to help the students .
in most communities we have a mental health worker who can help deal with these issues .
mr. speaker , the social worker deals with these issues on a regular basis .
one of the things that this government , mr. speaker , the nunavut government has done that we think is a strategic move is build capacity .
so i hope that helps the member in response to his question .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
supplementary , mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i thank the minister for a good response .
i would like to ask a last question about mental health workers .
how many times do they travel to remote communities to try to talk with people who might have problems .
when can they have permanent offices within nunavut communities so they will not have to keep travelling back and forth to larger and smaller communities .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. picco .

mr. iqaqrialu .
question 393 - 1 ( 3 ) :
teachers agreement
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i am not quite sure which minister i will be directing my question to , however i will have a short preamble .
the government signed an agreement with the teachers &apos; union , i will be directing my question to the premier .
there are many teachers in nunavut and there are other employees that are not teachers .
those people will be indirectly effected by the agreement that was signed just a short time ago .
i want to ask the premier if there will be any big changes in the communities .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
deputy premier , if you would care to answer that question .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you , mr. speaker .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. minister .
supplementary .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i am not quite sure what the minister is saying .
he was stating that the nunavut employees &apos; union represents all the employees .
does the agreement effect some other employees outside the school system .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
sorry mr. speaker , i was just getting some advice from my colleagues here on the interpretation of the honourable member &apos;s question .
that is what i referred to in my response earlier , that group is actively right now in negotiations right now with us and that is what i was referring to .
there are all the outstanding issues for pay , monetary issues for the balance of individuals not impacted by the federation of nunavut teachers agreement .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you minister .
supplementary , mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
perhaps if i rephrase my question .
i know we all have different jobs within the nunavut government , but they are all nunavut government employees , whether they are teachers or not .
if i were an employee of the nunavut government , i would probably envy the teachers &apos; pay raises that are in the collective agreement that they have just recently signed .
i think all nunavut employees should be considered , especially when it comes to pay raises .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
we certainly believe that the agreement that was reached with the federation of nunavut teachers with that organization , with that bargaining unit was a fair one and that both groups recognize that .
we are hoping that by the same token , the northern employees &apos; union reaches an agreement that their membership will accept and that is acceptable to the government of nunavut as well .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
oral questions .
mr. nutarak .
question 394 - 1 ( 3 ) :
time change review
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the question i will be raising was asked by one of the members earlier .
the premier indicated that he would be reviewing the time zone change .
how soon will he be putting out the review .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
yes , in a very short time we will be reviewing all the time zones and we will probably be having a nunavut-wide review .
thank you mr. speaker
speaker :
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
yes , the premier has indicated he will have some staff members carry out a nunavut wide review .
how soon will we be able to see the results of the review .
will it be next fall or next winter .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
yes after all the review has been completed we will be able to table a report with results and we will be open to suggestions .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
oral questions , mr. tootoo .
question 395 - 1 ( 3 ) :
pupil teacher ratio
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is for the minister responsible for education .
there has been a lot of talk over the last couple of days over the ptrs and the ratio of students per classroom .
through responses provided by the minister it is quite clear that there is a number they want to have .
it is quite evident that there are very few cases where that is met .
mr. speaker , i was wondering that in the west , in the nwt , the government over there passed legislation on class sizes .
i would like to ask the minister of education if he or his department is looking at developing such a proposal ..
speaker :
minister responsible for education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you , mr. speaker .
also , this has been the first year after we actually reviewed our own budget and we have been very busy .
we are not saying that ptr is not important we just haven &apos;t had time to completely review that yet .
in respect to the gnwt and ptr legislation , i don &apos;t believe there is such legislation governing the ptr .
you know that if you had thirty students taking out by one teacher .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
supplementary , mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i think in most communities anywhere that people would agree that once classes get too big you &apos;re not really educating the students , you are babysitting .
mr. speaker , this government has said that education is one of its top two priorities .
i think that there would be support for legislating the class size to ensure that adequate resources are put in place to give our children the quality of education that they deserve .
mr. speaker , i would just ask the minister , wouldn &apos;t that be something that his department would be developing and bringing forward .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
i would just remind the members that the preambles on your second and third questions if you can &apos;t shorten them up we will shorten them up for you .
minister of education .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i want to correct myself first .
we have a good relationship with the teachers and the communities .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. minister .
i will remind the minister also that they must keep their answers as precise as possible in fairness to the other side .
oral questions .
mr. kattuk .
question 396 - 1 ( 3 ) :
traditional polar bear harvest
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
as we have heard in the past , i am not sure who i should be directing my question to but perhaps to the government leader .
so , i would like to know the status of this .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
yes in regards to his question , this was taken to court and since it has been taken to court i cannot make any comments in regards to this issue .
we will hear about the results afterwards .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. minister .
oral questions . mr. mclean .
question 397 - 1 ( 3 ) :
purchase of office furniture
mr. mclean :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i was wondering if the minister responsible for public works if her departments plan to purchase office furniture for that building .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
for office furniture and supplies our department orders its supplies in .
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. mclean :
thank you , mr. speaker .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i would consider that , but i really don &apos;t know what the status is of the ordering but i will find out .
speaker :
thank you ms. thompson .
oral questions .
mr. havioyak .
question 398 - 1 ( 3 ) :
kugluktuk decentralization
mr. havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i will refer to a letter written by the premier to the mayor of kugluktuk , on the subject of decentralising positions to kugluktuk .
in that letter they confirmed positions for kugluktuk and the attachment said that three departments had identified positions but health and social services has not identified 10 positions that are going to kugluktuk .
so what i want to ask the minister of health first is to confirm the 10 positions and secondly when are they coming to kugluktuk .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister responsible for health , mr picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker and i would like to thank the member for his question .
over the last several month i &apos;ve had an opportunity to not only speak to the mayor of kugluktuk but also visit the community and we worked with member on this issue .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
supplementary , mr. havioyak .
mr. havioyak ( interpretation ) :
one of the questions that i asked , i know that we have ten positions , but just to confirm to me again are these permanent positions from the department .
speaker :
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i would just like to confirm that it is the intent of the department of health and social services , for kugluktuk to be following the decentralization policy .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
oral questions .
mr. barnabas .
question 399 - 1 ( 3 ) :
hamlet authority over time change
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i would like to direct my question to the premier .
he stated he was going to review the single time zone as soon as possible .
how will the nunavut government deal with this , are they going to overrule the hamlets using the nunavut time zone act .
speaker :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
we do have authority and power that was vested in us by the federal government and that is how we enacted this and we will review this within the year .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
supplementary , mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
our premier did not respond to my question .
for example , as i have stated before , these communities are not following the nunavut time zone , pangnirtung , sanikiluaq and clyde river .
will the government overrule these communities to change to the nunavut time zone or will they follow the hamlet act .
speaker :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the hamlet councils do not have any authority in regards to the time change and the nunavut government has been using their own act .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. premier .
oral questions .
mr. alakannuark .
question 400 - 1 ( 3 ) :
following the peoples wishes
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker i have to represent the people of nunavut and my question is directed to the government leader .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i am not sure what the member is asking .
maybe if he could clarify his question i could probably respond to his question .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
would the member clarify his question .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the question i heard a little while ago is , does the hamlet not have stronger legislation .
if we made legislation as a government , for instance for the people who do not want to follow the nunavut time zone , what will the government do about them .
if they wish to keep their local time will they keep their local time or will they have to go to the nunavut time as the government says .
speaker :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
we are reviewing this and we would like to hear from all the people of nunavut as to whether they support it or not .
we will be looking at all the communities that might be having a problem and we will want to hear from all the communities before we will deal with it again .
do they like the time or don &apos;t they .
so we will be reviewing this because we want to have the same time in nunavut and we will always be looking for a better thing for the people of nunavut .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. alakannuark , supplementary .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my supplementary question is for the government leader .
what about the hunters , because i am concerned about the hunters , will the hunters be involved in a review .
many older people in the communities have concerns and they always say they might not have authority or be involved in the government .
we mentioned before the nunavut government is for all people and i just wondered if they are going to be involved .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
yes we want them to be involved .
we will hear from all the people in the communities and we will be consulting with them if they come to any problems .
we will be open and we will be reviewing the problems the communities are having with the time .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
final supplementary for mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
the premier will be reviewing this and he will be seeking input from the communities .
will you be fixing a time if the majority wants to have different time zones .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
we will want to hear from all the people from nunavut communities .
we can not do anything about it until we do a review .
we will be trying to go to the communities before they go out camping .

&gt; &gt; house recessed for 20 minutes
item 20 :
consideration in committee of the whole of bills and other matters
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
we have a quorum now and we are now on item 3 during committee of the whole on the education department .
first , i would like to ask the minister if he has any opening comments , while he is still seated at his usual seat .
go ahead mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
part of it is a little bit different from 2000-2001 plans .
what i am trying to say is we will be using the capital substantiation sheets for 2000-2001 .
for the budget for 1999-2000 the detailed information substantiation sheets were tabled for 1999-2000 also included in there and the financial details are the same as the substantiation sheets they are both in detail .
i just wanted to point that out so as not to confuse the members .
just in case they might be asking questions so therefore we will probably be looking at the two substantiation sheets and with the main estimates .
thank you , mr. speaker .
also as i had stated before the translations are not completed yet but you may be able to get them as soon as they are completed .
he also asked that during the question period .
the pupil / teacher ratio is high now in our schools as it is for many across canada .
we plan to review it this coming year .
mr. chairman , in order for our department to establish a strong foundation , we need to have a strong sense of vision and principles to guide us .
we believe that education is a life-long process .
developing a nunavut education system will mean reviewing strategies , formulas and activities .
in our first year we started doing this as staff have been hired to do the work .
like all other departments there is a lot of work on everyone &apos;s plate and i stated that this morning too .
i am pleased to report that we have begun work on such activities as :
revising the education act to make our policies and legislation more reflective of nunavut .
doing a labour market needs analysis , which will help identify what jobs are needed and what training we need to put in place .
developing a long term curriculum and resource development strategy that will identify priorities our department needs to work on .
doing a language of instruction study to define a language policy and models so that we develop a strong language plan so we develop a strong bilingual education system .
we have begun a full review of income support and start developing strategies and programs that will promote independence .
reviewing early childhood and day-care programming so that they can also be made more nunavut relevant .
this coming year we will be looking at formulas used in the past .
we need to look at the k to 12 schools have been funded for teachers , program support teachers , language specialists and assistant principals .
it all comes down to cost and what we put in place has to be well planned and impacts best on our students with various types of programming .
mr. chairman , i welcome input and ideas from my colleagues and members to help improve learning and teaching in nunavut .
mr. chairman , these are available now they are translated both in english and inuktitut , those can be had immediately if you want .
tabvatau , qujannamiik , iqsivautau .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister of education .
first of all the minister indicated that i was mr. speaker , i am not mr. speaker , you should call me mr. chairman because i am just a chairman .
i think that is it for your speaking notes .
we will go back to item 3 .
thank you .
thank you for sitting down to the witness stand .
you are going to be dealing with the same items that we dealt with yesterday , but mr. minister if you could introduce your staff again before we go into general comments .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
if you people have to refer to them they will be available .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
and who are you .
who are you .
&gt; &gt; laughter
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
i am sorry .
my name is arvaluk .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
we are still under general comments for the department of education .
are there any general comments or questions .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , yesterday i had asked a question and we ran out of time before i could get any response .
i &apos;m just wondering he had indicated staff members who were going to answer that , i &apos;d just ask if i could get that response .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
the minister of education .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) : thank you mr. chairman .
yes , we are aware of the question .
we also stated that we have inherited this policy from gnwt and there are a lot of policies and regulations within the act .
so , we are going to have to review all that first and i am not sure about the status , so i am going to get naullaq to elaborate a little bit more .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
naullaq if you could elaborate a little bit more .
ms. arnaquq :
thank you . thank you , hunter asked the question yesterday where there are some discrepancies .
however , mr. arvaluk indicated that there would be a comprehensive review of all the funding that is provided to the schools according to how many students are entering the school system .
there are also program support teachers that have to be funded as well and the assistant principals and the counsellors that are in the schools .
the funding that we provide to these schools usually depends on how many mentally challenged students there are in the schools .
we also have some inuktitut instructors , we call them language specialists and usually the funding we provide them always depends on the amount of students that are in the classroom .
we also provide funds to the high schools and that depends on how many students will be in the high schools .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. arnaquq .
thank you for your response and i think mr. tootoo has another question .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
not another question mr. chairman .
that &apos;s an indication of young people quitting school for whatever reason .
i &apos;m just wondering if you are doing a study , it has nothing to do with the study , just a study on why this is happening .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. minister .
hon. james arvaluk :
this is like 101 dalmatians i think the answer is very much in that part .
we have to look at what we do with education and educational programs in the communities and what are the factors are contributing to the drop out rate or fall into the cracks .
so we are now looking at overall education as a whole rather than between the school and the pupil area .
so to elaborate more i would like ask again naullaq arnaquq to add .
nakurmiik .
ms. arnaquq ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
yes , we are aware of this problem and we have seen this in the past too .
the programs that we put out in the elementary and in the high schools are very much in need of overhaul .
a teacher sometimes leaves the community just when their students are getting to know them as well as the public .
i think this is one of the main causes of high school dropouts .
i mean there are many different reasons that we have to consider when we are reviewing the education act .
so , the support system is another thing that we will be looking into , it has become apparent that we need some kind of support system in the schools .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. arnaquq .
you have to go through the chairman every time you make a statement or make a response .
i think that everybody should be made aware of that , go through the chairperson .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
so , i guess out of that the answer is no .
i didn &apos;t really get an answer .
i couldn &apos;t pick one out of there as to whether that was something that they were doing , looking at reasons why we are losing those children in the high school , not .
let me just get a straight yes or no answer .
i guess that , either they are or they will be looking into trying to do a study to determine the causes for the high dropouts .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. minister of education .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
we already know a very large part why individuals sometimes do not continue pursuing high school until they reach , until they graduate .
what we will be trying to do is how to improve the completion or success rate of those students and those are numerous .
i would like my deputy minister to add to what the department of education has been doing so far on that .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister of education .
mr. moody .
mr. moody :
nakurmiik mr. chairman .
as the minister mentioned , a lot is known about the retention rates and the success or lack of success at the high school level in nunavut today .
the retention rate , people staying in high school and graduation rates are better today than they were five years ago that &apos;s a positive trend .
we are optimistic that those trends will continue .
on the specific question are we going to do more study on this .
it is my understanding mr. chairman that there have been several studies done in nunavut recently and some actual pilot projects so as the minister mentioned there is a lot known .
however , having said that , the minister has initiated a study which will not begin until later in the new year just again because there is a lot on our plates .
we actually have the terms of reference for the study done .
the minister outlines some of the things that are very relevant to nunavut and relevant in other places like parental support , like community ownership in schools , these things are very important .
that study will probably not begin until the october / november time frame just because of work load , but we will do it .
the last thing , i &apos;ll just repeat myself in saying that a lot of good work has been done in nunavut .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. moody , deputy minister .
mr. tootoo you may go ahead .
mr. tootoo :
that &apos;s okay mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i will be speaking in english .
( interpretation ends ) we have been talking a lot about pupil / teacher ratio in the past few days .
one of the reasons it is of such concern to us is because many of our students have special learning needs .
they need specialists , help , and extra support from staff to be in school .
i understand in the west , gnwt they have agreed to put extra funding into student support .
my question is what extra funding have you put into the budget this year for the student support and what are your plans for more funding for his purpose .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. barnabas .
mr. minister of education .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister of education .
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
i really do not know if you will be able to respond to my question but i would like to ask it .
( interpretation ends ) what are your plans to provide better support services for the students such as specialists and support staff .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. barnabas .
mr. minister of education .
hon. james arvaluk :
we are committed to reviewing all the aspects of the programs that we have inherited from the gnwt reviewing each and every one .
we already made approximately 15-16 new initiatives since we took office on april 1 , 1999 .
nakurmiik .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister of education .
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i am getting confused now .
as the minister has stated they will use quite large sums of money and they have a surplus .
where did the surplus come from , was that surplus going to be used for research .
there is surplus of 9.1 million dollars in the department of education .
where did that surplus come from .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. barnabas .
minister for education .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
we did not have the full capacity of staff .
two things happened here one the lack of support staff for the first year .
we have been hiring but we have not reached 100 percent .
in fact to date if i am incorrect we are about 75 percent staffed .
that is why what we come up with this so-called surplus .
it is not a true surplus .
it will not reflect the same way as the following year because we plan to have a 100 percent capacity for staffing .
so that they will do the work we have not done .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister for education .
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman the department of education as they have stated they are in the planning stages to review the education act .
as we have stated , we would like to have staff reflective of nunavut .
we would like to see acts that reflect nunavut .
when we were with the gnwt we had hardly seen what we wanted and that is when the nunavut government was created .
for example mr. chairman in 1999 in the kitikmeot regional council at that time we had our session and they had asked me when i was chairman .
i was a regional council member as a mayor .
i was asked to become the nwt disabled council .
since i have been a member of that board we have been discussing this matter as a nunavut resident and as a person coming from the kitikmeot region .
i know that we have physically handicapped people in various communities .
in kitikmeot we have deaf mute people and we have blind people .
we would like to although we try to help these people out by requesting for funding from gnwt .
it was impossible to get what i want .
since the minister is in the end stages of reviewing the act , the nunavut communities are expecting program and services for disabled people .
we are expecting some funding for disabled people so we can provide services in the schools .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson thank you mr. puqiqnak .
minister of education .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
yes , i agree with the member .
we have in the budget in education a section for people with handicaps .
but i would like to say to mr. puqiqnak in this year we spent more money for grades 9 to grade 12 because they are increasing in numbers .
if you had 20 students we would have one teacher , that is what we are trying to retain .
we also would like to have inuktitut curriculum and we have a development of the inuktitut curriculum . we have 400 thousand allocated for that purpose .
i think there is 1.2 million dollars allocated for teachers and we are doing research on development of an inuktitut curriculum for that purpose we also have some funding for that as well .
we had money allocated for a project in arviat .
i think they are going to have 67 thousand dollars allocated for that purpose .
there is about 94 thousand as well too for the curriculum development .
we also have the 120 thousand dollars for other purposes to due a study of the curriculum .
just to review whether the curriculum is put incorrectly and that is about 3 thousand dollars .
as well , we have development of tapes and other materials .
we have allocated money for that as well .
for this fiscal year we have planned to do these as soon as the budget is approved .
i am trying to say to the member that we are not going to try to follow the gnwt &apos;s way .
so that is what we are trying to put into the nunavut .
we want to do this as soon as we can but at times we can not really get going right away because we need the staff to do this .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
if you are going to be talking about the money the figure , please let us know exactly where we are .
at what page so this way we will know where exactly where we are at .
cause we are going to go right to the financial figures later .
mr. puqiqnak .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i understand what the minister is saying .
i believe we are all planning for better things after one year of being a nunavut government .
i believe we are all going to do our best .
when we had the gnwt government there were some disabled people going to school in alberta and british columbia .
i am sure nunavut can provide services for the disabled people and they can provide teachers as well .
when the students finish their grade 12 they have to go to another community or a southern institution to go to college and university training .
say for instance a disabled child has retained grade 12 do they also go for further education .
i just wanted to find out if you have a program where by the disabled people get to go to further education .
is that in your study as well .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. puqiqnak .
maybe if we can have a direct question to the minister .
minister of education .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i think i heard two questions .
the first question is that in regards to disabled children should be provided for services .
after they finish grade 12 do they go to further their education and they get some assistance to have further education in a southern institution .
also , when the disabled children that finish grade 12 . he wanted to get more services for them .
are those what the questions were .
is that my understanding .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. puqiqnak can you clarify your questions .
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
say for instance if a person was deaf mute in a community or blind person in the community they should be able to teach the teacher to teach those handicapped students there .
i just wanted to find out there is such a thing that the department of education is looking at .
what i am saying is i want to be able to get special services or education institution for those kind of the people that are blind or deaf or physically handicapped .
is that in your plans .
that is what my question is .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. puqiqnak . , maybe if we can ask one question at a time .
i think that would be a lot faster .
but i will let the minister respond .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
we believe that we should be able to help the children in their home .
if they want to be taught in their home community .
we use to send students after they finished their education in their community into another community if they have to further their education .
if the community did not have that grade in the community .
as for those people that are physically handicapped we would like to provide educational services for them as well .
if there is no teacher for blind person or a hearing impaired , they can not take education .
therefore , we would have to work with the council for the disabled .
i am not exactly what stage it is today on this .
i will get ms. arnaquq to respond .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
ms. arnaquq if you can further respond to that question .
ms. arnaquq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
there are three regional offices in each region and they all have divisional education councils and they all have special needs teachers .
it is a lot better for the students to be taught in their own community and to teach the parents and the teacher the sign languages for a deaf person .
because we used to send physically handicap students outside the community to teach them .
but now what we want to do is have more teachers to teach the special needs students can have their education in their own community .
our staff in arviat are doing research as to how we can get those services for those special needs students physically disabled , or blind or deaf .
they are going to do a review on what kind of services those students could be provided .
say for instance the pre-school students .
there are many pre-school students that are in that condition .
they will do a research on how many of them there are .
in addition , how many teachers they will need for those special needs students .
and in that research material they would have provided how many need those kinds of services and this is being done with our staff in arviat .
so this way we will have an up to date number of physically handicapped people that need to be taught .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. arnaquq .
i think one of his questions was that he would like to see an institution .
are looking at an institution in nunavut to teach those special needs students .
mr. minister of education .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
we are not thinking about a school .
we are thinking about putting a place for them .
there are some mentally handicap students to chesterfield inlet .
but we do not have any plans to put a school in each region for those special children .
but what we are stressing is that we are trying to provide education in their homes but we have not put any plans to build a school .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
is that it .
mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
my question will be brief .
in the communities the teacher or student teacher ratio .
i know that there are too many problems with too many children in one classroom .
what kind of plans do you have to improve the situation .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
mr. minister .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
like i indicated yesterday , we have touched upon this subject a little bit .
we are trying to have 22 to 1 ratio .
we are trying to keep students at the same academic level in one classroom .
let us say in grade 6 if there are 20 students to 1 teacher .
like in grade 6 , if there were 40 students than we would try to split the amount .
let say we would have 20 grade 6 students in each class .
so that the number of students will be equal in each classroom .
for instance if there were 17 students in grade 6 the number would remain the same .
those are the kinds of things we are trying to deal with .
we are trying to average out the number of students in each classroom if it is possible .
we are trying to target 22 as an average number of students in one classroom .
if there are more than 20 , lets say 40 , if there are close to 40 students in one classroom than we will try to split them into two .
however we have been having difficulties and the reason being is that we do fund the schools depending on a number of students that will be enrolled .
so following that we give a lump sum of money for a year of operation .
than the teacher or than it up to the principal to divide the number of students to see how best to serve them in the classroom .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
yes i understand his response .
he indicated that he tries to average out the number of students in the classroom .
if that is the case than the communities would be better served .
have they agreed to this kind of arrangement .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. alakannuark .
mr. minister .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
i did not quite get his question .
if he can rephrase his question .
thank you chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. alakannuark .
mr. alakannuark ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
my main question is i know we have overcrowding in classrooms .
having said that if you are going to solve this particular problem than will that help the community as a whole .
like will this kind of arrangement be better for the students and the teachers in the classrooms .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i think you understand the question now .
mr. minister .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
we will be reviewing this and try to improve in areas where there is a big concern .
like i indicated , we have 27 students in grade 6 .
also , there are a certain number of students in grade 7 .
then we try to divide the number of students into two classrooms .
but we will be studying this further .
for example , if there are 400 students in the school then we will fund the school depending on the number of students enrolled .
if we have to make any improvements in any area then we are quite open to discuss these with teachers or the principals .
if we do not have any discussion with the principal then we talk to the teachers .
i know mr. tootoo also asked a question about this earlier .
but i can not say at this point in time what kind of improvements we will make until we have the study completed .
i am hoping in the next budget session we will have everything in place .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairperson .
before i get in to my next question .
i just like to ask the minister or staff if the are aware or know what the current drop out rate in nunavut is .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
mr. minister .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , it is my understanding and the minister can correct me if i &apos;m wrong , the information is that the rate is close to 85 % .
i have some demographics here that i want to mention from the minister &apos;s departmental business plan .
thirty one percent of the population aged 15 and over have less than grade nine .
it is true as the minister said that young people are staying in school longer and reaching higher levels , but graduation rates for grade 12 and university are well below the national average .
nunavut has the highest rate of unemployment in canada . over 53 % of the people in nunavut with a grade less than 9 would like a job but can &apos;t get one .
mr. chairman , in light of this type of information i think what i was getting at earlier , is why are we losing our kids in high school .
unless we can solve that problem mr. chairman , these numbers are going to stay at this level and are not going to improve .
at this time while we are developing a new education act and looking at a made in nunavut system , we have to find a way to address what the core problem is .
if we have a real high dropout rate for whatever reason , we need to know why that is .
i think that is why the department should take a look at what is causing these numbers .
a real in-depth look at how we deliver our programs and services and ensure that we are doing that in a way that is most beneficial .
i will be the first to say that the system that we have is inherited from the northwest territories .
the system that was there before .
maybe it is time that we have a real fundamental look at how the school system is run .
i don &apos;t know if that is part of the problem or not but unless something is done those numbers aren &apos;t going to change and this is a beginning .
if we don &apos;t fix them now then who knows when it will happen again .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of education .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
i am not as pessimistic as the member is stating because there have been some improvements in the past , even including today .
it was because we know that it is not acceptable .
but we mentioned that in the fall .
the social conditions of our communities in respect to the young people that the member is talking about are a very serious issue .
i think i could be speaking on behalf of the government that people &apos;s attitude has completely improved since the nunavut government was created in 1999 , april 1 , 1999 .
education i don &apos;t think is an exception to that improvement .
it is just that we had a very bad start when the dropout rate influenced the young people and their parents , which occurred without the government &apos;s control .
maybe through poor planning , maybe the belief in democracy , in freedom , i don &apos;t know .
if we don &apos;t do anything about it now the member will agree with me , it will have a detrimental effect down the road .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of education .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman . as i stated that when the gnwt introduced the school system and the high school programs in the communities , the success rate has increased .
when we start hiring teachers from kindergarten to grade 3 and 6 , the success rate in the elementary and the pride and the confidence of the students also improves .
i am interested in that because sometimes when it just does not work , it has a reciprocating effect with all the staff members , especially with the teachers and the students .
all that will be looked at how as a department we handle our schools , including staff and the relationship between the parents and ourselves for the benefit of the students .
because the bottom line is how do we succeed with the students .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister of education .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i look forward to seeing that , just going off to a different topic mr. chairman , i would just like to ask if the minister could tell us how the schools are funded .
i understand that it is all based on student population .
i wonder if you could explain how much funding a school gets per child and what that &apos;s all .. how that &apos;s all broken down between schools .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. tootoo .
minister of education .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
apparently it is very complicated , and very mechanical trying to use the formula that the department of education uses for that .
i would like to have mr. moody answer that question .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. moody .
mr. moody :
nakurmiik , mr. chairman .
the basis of the formula is , as the member has suggested , a per dollar amount per student but then there are other parts to the formula .
for example there is so much for special needs , there is another separate funding for example , for school bussing that is available .
there is an allotment for the administration , it goes on and on .
nakuurmiik .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. moody .
before i recognize anybody else , when i was young , when i started being involved in committees and boards and agencies , i use to work with louis pilakapsi and raymond ningeocheak .
i would like to recognize them and welcome them because they have been the main people to create nunavut also .
&gt; &gt; applause
thank you . mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
this is very brief . question .
within the education department if there was any urgent requirement do you have any reserve funds , contingency funds .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
minister of education .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
i would like to ask that question to be replied to by the minister of finance .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister of education .
minister of finance , if you can respond .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
i don &apos;t know what kind of a slush fund the department of education would have within their budgets .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister of finance .
minister of education .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i would like to thank the finance minister for his reply and would like to supplement .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister of education and the finance minister .
your responses are clear .
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i have two questions .
the first one being , as i am aware now we are using the alberta curriculum system with our educational curriculum .
i really do not know where the line is drawn when i was with the divisional board of education we planned the curriculum to grade six , we completed that curriculum for those grades .
the curriculum from grade 7 to grade 12 were being planned and worked on that would be used for nunavut .
some parents wanted to have inuktitut curriculum for their children , so what is the status of that plan now .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. barnabas .
there are two questions he posed at the same time and you can respond to both , minister of education .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
mr. chairman , perhaps i would like to respond to the first one , the second question i did not quite understand .
so i would like to get clarification from him .
thank you mr. chairman .
for that reason , those are our goals and that is our mission .
once we complete the curriculum it will be easier , and perhaps at that time we will have a mission so that we can be up to par with the rest of the world .
if i am not too clear , naullaq can elaborate .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister .
i would like to ask mr. barnabas if you got the response that you were looking for since you asked two questions .
could you elaborate on your second question please .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
mr. chairman , perhaps i will wait for naullaq &apos;s response .
i think i know the answer but i would like to see or hear it for the record so that the rest of my colleagues &apos; can know about it too .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. barnabas .
you know the answers and you do not bring them out .
ms. arnaquq .
&gt; &gt; laughter
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
mr. chairman , yes we can respond to you in a document and that way we can have a detailed response , especially about high schools and the alberta system .
we have to keep up to their level and that &apos;s what we are working on and we are now in the planning stages to make a report on that .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you minister of education .
your second question , you &apos;re okay now .
thank you . mr. nutarak .

minister &apos;s statement 105 - 1 ( 3 ) :
community fashion show
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
mr. speaker , the theme of last night &apos;s fashion show was the past , present and the future .
those fashions have been designed by inuit but they have been manufactured in montreal .
the obvious next step was to develop a collection that would be designed and manufactured in nunavut by nunavummiut .
last evening the toonik tyme audience had an opportunity to see the premiere of the first fur collection designed and manufactured in nunavut .
this was the result of four workshops that were held here in iqaluit that was a collaborative effort through the department of sustainable development and the nunavut arts and crafts association .
these workshops were also an important link between our work with harvesters in stabilising the supply of quality furs and our efforts of improving access to world markets .
mr. speaker , the nunavut fur collection is a tremendous example of building on the self-reliance and strengths of nunavummiut .
on may 5 , i will be participating in the montreal fur show where i will see the nunavut fur collection unveiled on the world stage for the first time .
it is an event that brings the pride of nunavut and nunavummiut to the world and i feel privileged to be able to attend once again .
mr. speaker , let me extend my congratulations to everyone who contributed to the success of last night &apos;s fashion show .

birthdays and cost of airfare
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , first i would like to announce that today is my son &apos;s birthday and i would like to wish him a very happy birthday .
i love him , and i am very happy about his birthday .
also , to my colleague , the minister of health and social services , i believe that it his birthday today too and i am very proud of the minister .
mr. speaker , i rise today to make a statement that first air flies up to my community and also goes on to pond inlet .
they have been very helpful to the people and the inuit , but i also know they have a monopoly going to my community .
it is now 1 thousand 263 dollars to fly to my community and i &apos;m sure it is much more expensive if you fly on to pond inlet .
mr. speaker , this is an ongoing concern to my community .
there are also people , especially people travelling for medical reasons who go on standby and do not get an opportunity to get on the plane if there is a full load .
i believe that we would use less money in the long run if we paid full fare to go there .

governor general &apos;s visit to rankin inlet
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to inform my colleagues that the governor general went to rankin inlet a couple of days ago and she had a meeting with the hamlet council .
their main concern was the teacher / student ratio and that something has to be done about it .
that they have to include more inuit programs in the schools and also that they need additional teachers for special needs students or specialized teachers who would take care of our special needs students .
also there is a very high turnover of teachers and especially more so in the smaller communities , where there is a very high turnover of teachers .
they spend a few months in the community and then either go back home or move to larger communities .
also , one of their main concerns was the high number of suicides and social problems .
there has to be suicide prevention done in all the communities .
those were the major issues that the people of rankin inlet identified and we should work harder to work on these problems .
we have to deal with social issues .
the hamlet councillors believe that healthy living is an integral part of the school .
mr. speaker , in closing , i know i am running out of time and i seek unanimous consent to conclude my comments .

are there any nays .

mr. anawak , please proceed .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
i apologize for laughing , when i pointed at that little light it went on .
the hamlet council was also talking about the youth and their need for more opportunities for employment and more adequate recreational facilities .
for example , more arenas , drop in centres and recreational facilities .
the hamlet council also gave the governor general a document saying they wanted an outdoor recreational park .
they were also at the maani ulujuk school , where she had an open conversation with the youth and children of rankin inlet .
she visited facilities and private businesses and a dinner held by the hamlet council and the keewatin inuit association and other businesses .
at this dinner the hamlet also donated some dollars so there would be a food bank made available for the less fortunate .
they also announced the upingatuk , which is the spring festival where she donated funds to this spring festival .
i just wanted to make those comments and she was very well received in rankin inlet .

congratulations to kenn harper
hon. manitok thompson :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , please bear with me if i go over my time limit i will be as brief as possible .
mr. speaker , i rise today to express my admiration and my sincere congratulations to a long time northern resident , educator , businessman and author , mr. kenn harper .
in particular mr. speaker , i wish to commend mr. harper on the renewed success of his book &quot; give me my father &apos;s body :
the life of minik , the new york eskimo .
a book mr. harper researched , wrote and self-published about 15 years ago .
it was a book that i used with great impact when i taught northern studies at maani ulujuk high school in rankin inlet .
as well mr. harper &apos;s book has been chosen as a book of the month club selection for april and has been optioned by actor kevin spacey to possibly be made into a movie .
the story of minik is a tragic tale and one that deserves to be told loudly and often around the world for everybody to hear .
as many of you know , in 1897 minik , as a 7 year old boy , was delivered to new york city along with his father qisuk and four other inuit .
there they were put on display throughout the city and at the new york american museum of natural history .
within a short time mr. speaker , most of the inuit had passed away from exposure to disease for which they had no natural immunity .
this tragedy left the young minik all alone in the largest city in north america .
i would like to receive unanimous consent to conclude my statements mr. speaker .
speaker :
the member is seeking unanimous consent to conclude her statements .
any nays .
proceed ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
i cannot imagine how alone he must have felt .
to make matters worse the museum staged a mock burial of minik &apos;s father when in reality they had autopsied the body , bleached and varnished the bones and put them on display .
to add insult to this terrible tragedy , during a visit to the museum , minik discovered the bones of his father on display in that infamous exhibit .
in minik &apos;s own words he said :
&quot; i threw myself at the bottom of the glass case and prayed and wept .
i went straight to the director and implored him to let me bury my father .
he would not .
i swore i would never rest until i had given my father burial . &quot;
mr. speaker , minik passed away in 1918 after a life of confusion and lost culture .
minik remains buried near the connecticut river in pittsburgh , new hampshire .
mr. speaker , i hope that the renewed interest in mr. harper &apos;s work and the possible making of a movie will allow more people to be made aware of this sad story .
thank you mr. speaker .

special constable ooyoumut honoured
mr. mclean .
thank you , mr. speaker .
the rcmp has been policing the north for more than a century and many paid the supreme price in bringing the nation &apos;s laws to the north .
equally gratifying is seeing the rcmp honour its special constables .
in the early to mid 1900 &apos;s , contributions of special members to that of regular members were immense .
the special members taught land and survival skills , familiarised them with direction and literally provided them with the clothing on their backs to survive the harshest climate on the earth .
without the help of these constables the rcmp &apos;s presence in the north may have been short-lived .
ooyoumut , a special constable to the baker lake detachment , will be among those honoured .
ooyumut drowned on july 24 , 1954 at the rcmp fish camp in qikiqtauyaq , on the southwest side of baker lake .
rcmp sergeant bill johnson of the rcmp community policing section co-ordinated the event which actually began in 1998 for an rcmp 125th anniversary project .
&quot; several members thought it would be a nice tribute to the rcmp who died during our more than 100 years policing in the north &quot; , says johnson .
the rcmp have erected a stone wall at its headquarters building in yellowknife .
a plate for each member honoured will be mounted on the wall bearing their name , regimental number , place and date of death .
the early role of the special constable was primarily to provide safe passage for regular members who located to northern canada .
they had to learn land skills and a special constable would lead them on patrols by dog team , canoe and foot , and even taught them to build igloos .
special constables were considered the members &apos; lifeline by providing vital knowledge .
corporal claire dent worked with ooyoumut and found his body .
he constructed a hand made casket and wooden cross bearing his name , rank and date of death .
then he dressed in his red surge and provided him with as dignified a regimental service as he could under those conditions in 1954 , says johnson .
ooyoumut &apos;s surviving daughters sally webster and lucy evo and his granddaughters will be attending the ceremony .
this is a great honour for our family having lost our mother a year ago .
it comes as a great blessing to us they said .

community freezers
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i rise today to talk about my concern and i think this a concern for everyone in nunavut concerning community freezers .
some of the communities do not have community freezers and i would like to see a community freezer in every community , because people can use them to store their food .
sometimes people run out of food in their homes and they could use these freezers .
this is a very useful item to have .
it helps other people .
during the wintertime it doesn &apos;t help too much but during the spring and summer time it is very useful .
food goes bad for people that do not have community freezers .
we should be giving more consideration to that .
i have heard this from people that have stated this as a concern for them .
we have to help our people in every way we can , because the cost of living and groceries continues to grow .
those are my comments .

iqaluit street names
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
first i would like to thank mr. iqaqrialu for wishing me a very early happy birthday of course it is not for another nine or ten months .
mr. speaker , the debate around the official naming and acknowledging the streets of iqaluit has raised its head again .
about three months ago i was contacted by canadian geographic magazine about the issue of iqaluit &apos;s street names .
it seems that it has become somewhat of a national curiosity .
mr. speaker i would like to take the opportunity to add my voice to the number of people that have spoken out on the issue of naming of iqaluit &apos;s streets .
we know mr. speaker that some of our roads do have official and somewhat unofficial names .
mr. speaker , i would also suggest current road names as the road to nowhere or , upper base drive to help retain the unique nature of our community .
i would also ask that our council endorse and continue the process of naming and renaming of our streets after consultation with our elders and our residents .

heritage centre in cambridge bay
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i ask the indulgence of the members .
mr. speaker , in response to the statement the honourable member for cambridge bay made previously .
the honourable member &apos;s statement specifically made reference to a capital project and myself in iqaluit .
mr. speaker i would like to say again for the record that the idea of a heritage centre in a school is a great idea .
i would support them in cambridge bay and every other community in nunavut .
so the community could celebrate their culture .
mr. speaker , there is no question that if every community in nunavut would put forth such a project all the people would agree this is a great idea .
it is great that the honourable member from cambridge bay has such community support for these projects as outlined by the letters he read yesterday .
however there are other concerns and maintenance problems which result in school closures in my community and others and they are not on the list of capital projects this year .
we all agree that there is only so much money to go around and i support the motions made yesterday by the standing committee on culture , education and health .
that priority has to go first to meeting the basic capital needs .
mr. speaker , i would like to seek unanimous consent to conclude my statement .
speaker :
the member is seeking unanimous consent to conclude his statement .
are there any nays .
there are no nays .
proceed mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. speaker and colleagues .
the honourable member noted that the heritage centre will cost 525 thousand and the larger gym would cost 395 thousand .
i wish the community of cambridge bay well and am glad to hear that they have begun raising funds towards these additional facilities they desire .
i believe that all members are in support of replacing the high school in cambridge bay , which has an overall budget over 14 million .
when the temporary facility renovations are added in , the overall budget is over 16 million .
mr. speaker , the honourable member has stated previously that the insurance on this school may only result in 10 million .
the government of nunavut will have to pay whatever the additional costs will be and that will be a measure of our support for this school .

mr. speaker i rise today to provide a response to an oral question posed to me by mr. tootoo on february 17 , 2000 .
the member wanted to know the subsidies are determined for the different fuel products .
mr. speaker subsidies for different products are determined as follows :
ppds mandate is to recover all operating expenses from retail sales such as :
actual product costs ; actual transportation costs ; commissions for local fuel sales , dispensing and delivery services ; operating and maintenance expenses ; product evaporation / shrinkage ;
andtaxes ( where applicable )

return to oq 318 - 1 ( 3 ) : grise fiord school project
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. speaker .
i have a return to an oral question asked by mr. barnabas on wednesday march 29 , 2000 .
when reviewing the historical gnwt capital planning list it was noted that grise fiord received 150 thousand for the design phase of a proposed school addition .
the design work was done in the fiscal year 98-99 with the construction planned for the year 99-2000 .
prior to the creation of nunavut , the gnwt deferred the project and it was taken off the 99-2000 capital program the nunavut government inherited .
i have asked that the grise fiord project be reactivated and have place 200 thousand dollars in the estimates to cover the costs associated with updating the design of the school .
i believe the grise fiord project will benefit the children of the community and relieve the pressure on the existing facility due to overcrowding .

nunavut minimum wage
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na uqaqti .
this minimum wage came into affect with the old gnwt .
in two other jurisdictions , the yukon is at 7.20 an hour , and british columbia is at 7.15 an hour .
my question today is for the minister of justice .
can he confirm to this house or will he look at and review the minimum wage for nunavut .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak :
thank you mr. speaker .
at this time the department of justice is not reviewing the minimum wage .
thank you .
speaker :
supplementary .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na uqaqti .
it is good to hear that from the minister .
i know that we &apos;re into union negotiations .
one has been settled , one is not settled .
but for those that toil for minimum wage i do not think in the last few years that the minimum wage has been reviewed to reflect the consumer wage index in nunavut .
i am sure our cost of living has gone up in the last ten years since the minimum wage was raised .
so will the minister commit to look at the minimum wage issue .
thank you .
speaker :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak :
thank you mr. speaker .
the results might be good to have too before any changes are made to the minimum wage .
so it would depend on getting some information before hand to go forward on this .
thank you .
speaker :
supplementary , mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na uqaqti .
that is reassurring that the minister answered my question .
so can the minister give me a time line when they will collect this information and get back to the members of the house regarding revisiting the minimum wage in nunavut .
thank you mr. speaker .

question 402 - 1 ( 3 ) :
legal consequences over time zone
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker , i have a question to the minister of justice mr. anawak .
yesterday the government leader or the premier stated that the hamlets do not have any authoriy on the change to the single time zone .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister anawak .
hon. jack anawak :
there are only three communities that do not want to change their hours and i am sure they are going to run into a problem .
it will create a problem for nunavut government employees because they will be operating in a different time zone , that would be the problem .
but our premier said that he would do a review .
thank you .
speaker :
supplementary mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas :
thank you mr. speaker .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister anawak .
hon. jack anawak :
thank you mr. speaker .
because again if we get any employees in communities who are working for the government of nunavut obviously they are going to be working at the same time as the nunavut population .
such as the time in the headquarters here in iqaluit .
so that might be the problem .
if they are in a different time zone than nunavut then that might create some problems for that community .
not the rest of nunavut .
thank you .
speaker :
supplementary , mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my supplementary is , if the government is going to take formal action against such a town or hamlet .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. barnabas .
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak :
thank you mr. speaker .
obviously the people of nunavut prefer the one time zone because at this point only three of the communities are under different time than the rest of nunavut .
i would suggest that those three communities go along with the rest of the population that want the same time zone .
speaker :
thank you mr. anawak .
final supplementary .
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker thank you for that clarification .
so we find that there are only three communities that are operating on the eastern time zone .
are the three communities going to be forced to follow with the single time zone .
speaker :
minister anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
like i said , it is going to create a problem for our government of nunavut employees because they will be operating in a different time zone .
it is going to create a problem for the community but i also know that in the baffin area it was a problem for the baffin region .
but today we would get used to it .
so we are hoping that all nunavut communities should go on the single time zone .
but like our premier said yesterday there will be a review done and we &apos;ll find out from the people .
we will find out in less than six months .
we will inform the members and also the people of nunavut .

mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :

is there a commercial diving instructor in nunavut .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :

i am not quite sure where they had their training .
could you tell me where they got their diving training .
speaker :
minister kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker . i believe there are sixteen who took recreational diving not commercial diving .
if anyone of these sixteen went to that training course they knew that they were not qualified to do commercial diving .
that is how it goes .
you have to go to the first level and i am sure the students very well knew what they were taking at that time .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. minister .
supplementary . mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :

thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
we all know that there is some diving around here in iqaluit .
but for further clarification there are sixteen in nunavut who took this diving course and every single one of them can go diving for clams but they can not sell them commercially .
i want that difference to be known .

it is a return to oral question asked by hunter tootoo on february 17 , 2000 and the minister of public works and housing made the reply .
they have to be the same in both languages .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
we will get this rectified .
we had quite a lot of returns on the petroleum products and we will get it fixed and bring it out again .
thank you , mr. speaker .

question 405 - 1 ( 3 ) :
community freezers
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question will be directed to the minister responsible for sustainable development .
some communities do not have community freezers .
are you going to do a review to see if you can get some funding for community freezers .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
this is not the first time that this has been raised as an issue .
some years ago the hamlets were given more authority , they were also given the authority of operating and maintaining the community freezers .
once that occurred it was not a departmental responsibility .
i know they were provided for by the governments originally but now they are held by the hamlets .
thank you , mr. speaker .

question 406 - 1 ( 3 ) :
hamlet by-laws
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question will be directed to the community government &amp; transportation minister , mr. anawak .
mr. speaker , the hamlets are able to make bylaws and according to bylaw 2-9 , this bylaw allows hamlets to make their own by-laws by way of resolutions .
mr. speaker , this bylaw 2-9 , is it able to be overridden by the government .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
when the hamlets produce their own bylaws to govern themselves the minister for community government &amp; transportation has to approve those bylaws , so yes therefore he can override them .
thank you .
speaker :
supplementary . mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker this bylaw 2-9 , gives authority to the hamlets , it seems to me that this bylaw is strong so that the ministry cannot override it .
that seems to be the case mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
that is because the hamlets fall under the department of community government &amp; transportation and you cannot be in conflict with one another .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. anawak .
supplementary .
mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker , but this bylaw is already a part of the authority .
it is already in effect , it is already a bylaw .
so , what does this mean .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
the federal government has acts , laws and then the provincial governments have their own acts that cannot conflict with the federal laws and it is the same idea with nunavut .
the nunavut government &apos;s laws are always stronger than the community laws .
thank you .
speaker :
final supplementary .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
are they no longer welcome to set their own time zones then .
speaker :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
people from igloolik will have to work within the nunavut time zone if they work for the government .

question 407 - 1 ( 3 ) :
status of apprenticeship programs
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
thank you .
speaker :
minister kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
yes , there was an agreement in 1974 .
at that time it was between the federal and territorial governments and with nanisivik .
during it &apos;s life span of 25 years there was an agreement that provided for co-operation on apprenticeship training .
this was supported by the federal government .
they would provide apprenticeship in nanisivik but the position that was supposed to be in charge of the apprenticeship training programs was never filled .
to this day there &apos;s still no position that has ever been filled although it was supposed to be long ago .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you minister .
supplementary . mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
yes , i understand that stipulation that he is referring to because i met with them and we discussed that .
my question is this , i know that they are designing apprenticeship over in nanisivik and other areas .
i &apos;m just wondering if the government of nunavut plans to pursue this matter , to provide apprenticeship training at those two mines that i represent up in polaris and nanisivik .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. barnabas .
minister kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
last year when i was recently elected as minister for the department we went and visited the community along with the member for the high arctic .
at our visit we discussed a number of times later on that there should have been an apprenticeship co-ordinator and that we should pursue the matter .
now , mr. speaker at this time we are still talking within the department of sustainable development , with the education department and the federal government .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you minister .
item 6 .
oral questions . mr. iqaqrialu .
question 408 - 1 ( 3 ) :
time zone effect on non-decentralized communities
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
in my community there is also a different time zone and we do not expect any decentralized positions .
i seem to understand that the new time zone will be enforced in the decentralized communities and will not affect those smaller communities that will not get decentralized jobs .
they will not be affected by any time changes so i would like some clarification on this .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
mr. speaker we are not trying to make you think that we are against those communities that have their own time zones .
because you are going to have some teachers in your communities as well , you are going to have some employees in the communities .
you can &apos;t keep beating a dead horse and we would like to come to an agreement whereby we all have on central time zone .
but if the hamlets wish to do something else they have to realize that the employees for the nunavut government will have to have separate times for themselves to work by .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
supplementary .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , he responded to me very clearly and i appreciate his attentiveness .
thank you , mr. speaker .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
are people happy with the current time zone without continually changing .
is it better to remain on the same time frame that we have been using .
for example in saskatchewan they don &apos;t do a day light savings time or change their clocks throughout the year , they stay as one central time zone .
many people were unhappy with going back an hour and we wanted to look at whether we want to do a time change on an annual basis in order to accommodate daily savings time .
we need to be on the same clocks , even if we are on a large piece of land there is not that many people .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you minister .

question 409 - 1 ( 3 ) :
firearms officer
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na uqaqti .
i know this is probably a federal government jurisdiction and we all know what it &apos;s like dealing with the federal government up here .
unlike southern canada , people rely on firearms for their food , clothing and sometimes shelter .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
minister anawak .
hon. jack anawak :
certainly mr. speaker we will do what we can .
i &apos;m happy to announce the recent secondment to the federal government of electoral officer josh timotee to be involved as the firearms officer in part of nunavut .
mr. timotee has just taken over the nunavut firearms office here in iqaluit very recently .
as a matter of fact i think it may have in been the last couple of days so , there is somebody there now .
the chief firearms officer has informed my department that he has two pilot projects .
one in clyde river and one in cape dorset where a team of firearms officers visited the communities to figure out how to expedite people who want to register or purchase firearms .
i am very glad to have josh timotee working with the chief firearms officer of nunavut to make sure that the problems that have been encountered to date are dealt with .
thank you .

question 410 - 1 ( 3 ) :
status of apprenticeship board
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i &apos;m not sure who my question is directed to , there was a question directed to the minister of sustainable development earlier on apprenticeships .
i know it was previously under the department of education so i &apos;ll ask my question and the appropriate minister can reply .
i &apos;m just wondering if there is such a board being set up in nunavut .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister responsible for education , mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i have my apprenticeship division under the leadership of noah paniyuk , supervisor of apprenticeships to prepare a policy paper on apprenticeship and trades .
i will also be receiving the results of a five year labour needs analysis that jack was talking about , or mr. anawak was talking about .
thank you .
speaker :
supplementary . mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i &apos;m sorry i missed the last part of the minister &apos;s statement , he said i believe later this year he said early spring or summer .
was the minister indicating he hopes to have such a board , trades or occupational board or apprenticeship board set up .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister .
hon. james arvaluk :
so as soon as we are able to give you the answer we will .
but because i am not certain i don &apos;t want to guess anything , so i &apos;ll take that question as notice .
thank you .

thank you minister .

question 411 - 1 ( 3 ) :
homelessness programs in nunavut
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister responsible for homeless people , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i think when i returned from that meeting with minister bradshaw in ottawa i updated the house .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you minister .
supplementary mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , the minister &apos;s reply was two fold .
for example , in iqaluit , and iqaluit is a larger community in nunavut , there are many people who are homeless , that have no homes especially those who are less fortunate .
in the smaller communities there are not too many people who are homeless because they usually stay with their family members .
it means that there is a housing shortage or people are living in overcrowded situations .
so which case are you going to address .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. barnabas .
minister picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , here in nunavut as the minister of housing has outlined and the premier has outlined , we know that having 15 people in a three bedroom home is homelessness .
the two terms being used are relative homelessness , mr. speaker , and absolute homelessness .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you minister .
oral questions . mr. iqaqrialu .
question 412 - 1 ( 3 ) :
assistance for elder funding applications
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i will be directing my question to the premier since he is taking the responsibility of the culture , language , elders &amp; youth portfolio .
i think there are many elders now who have experienced this and have tried to write the application forms .
as a nunavut government we keep saying that we would like to incorporate inuit qaujimajatuqangit and the elders would be very beneficial to help with this .
for that very reason , i was wondering if the minister could commit to get some funding allocated to the elders so that we could give the elders support .
i think i have just asked two questions but i am sure you can understand what i am saying .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
supplementary mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
it is evident that the elders have documented the history but the elders do not know how to apply for funding because this is not their way of life .
i am sure that we could find funds to help the elders to write their application forms so that they could document the inuit culture .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
premier .
hon. paul okalik ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i know that there is presently a review being done .
our past minister initiated that review and we will inform the members once the review is completed .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. premier .
before we continue i would like to recognize elizabeth copeland from whale cove who is the chief coroner for nunavut .

question 413 - 1 ( 3 ) :
gun control legislation pilot projects
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
possibly , because i misunderstood i would like to ask my question again about gun control legislation .
i would like to direct this question to the same minister .
he stated that there were two communities where they did a pilot project .
could the minister tell us which community showed better results .
thank you .
speaker :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
we looked at these two communities and we did exactly the same thing in both communities .
i believe it was with the help of the hunters &apos; and trappers &apos; organizations .
but the study that was done in cape dorset and clyde river were exactly the same and if it looks good then we will set up a uniform system right throughout nunavut .
thank you .
speaker :
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
well after two communities have been studied i am sure that you have found a better system for them and then again other communities are having a hard time getting firearms .
in iqaluit there is one person who will have to wait well over a week to get his gun and there was one person who could not get one at all .
when are you going to put this nunavut wide system in place after the review of these two communities .
thank you , mr. speaker .

question 414 - 1 ( 3 ) :
ownership of public housing
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) : thank you , mr. speaker .
these houses are going to be built by contractors but are they going to be built and owned by the construction company .
thank you .
speaker :
minister responsible for public works , ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker , of course the budget will have to be approved first , but we know that we have intentions of building 100 houses .
we are going to be following the nunavummi nangminiqaqtunik ikajuuti policy where we will give preferences to inuit companies .
we will get all the details first before i give you the information but i do understand that there will be contracted out .
the construction company would order the house and the construction company would build them , but the smaller parts will be subcontracted .

question 415 - 1 ( 3 ) :
baker lake unemployment rate
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na uqaqti .
uqaqti , i was reading the statistics for unemployment in nunavut and i was very alarmed at some of the figures .
we had baker lake with an unemployment rate of about 20 % and i know for a fact that is off by about 40 % .
i wonder if the minister responsible could tell me how these stats and fantasy stats are compiled .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you , mr. speaker .
could the member clarify that , i am sorry i didn &apos;t catch all of it .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na uqaqti .
i wonder if the minister responsible can advise me as to how these statistics were compiled because i think they are greatly exaggerated .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
premier .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you , mr. speaker .
how they were compiled was in accordance with the collection of statistics that is the accepted norm throughout canada and in nunavut they were higher than what is normal practice .
for example , in baker lake there were 341 people sampled out of a population of 880 .
about 38.75 percent of the residents .
that is a lot higher than what is normally done in the rest of canada .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
supplementary mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na uqaqti .
it is alarming to see stats that are inaccurate like that .
i wonder if the minister responsible could have a made in nunavut statistic policy looked at so that it could reflect the real statistics in nunavut and not the federal statistics .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. mclean .
mr. premier .
hon. paul okalik :
thank you , mr. speaker .
so we will have to make sure that &apos;s acceptable .

clarification question .
when the minister of finance spoke earlier about 525 thousand being allocated for new heritage centres to be put to replace killiniq high school in cambridge bay .
how much of the expenditure is in the education capital estimates for 2000 / 2001 .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. barnabas .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
there is nothing in the education budget identified as that amount .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas :
thank you mr. chairman .
could you explain in the expenditures , capital estimates for 2000 / 2001 , under the item heritage centres .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
minister arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
i cannot answer that because i don &apos;t look after culture , language , elders &amp; youth .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
i think mr. chairman we are dealing with the department of education budget here .
at the appropriate time when the culture , language , elders &amp; youth budget comes up we can deal with that appropriation at that time .
otherwise we will be jumping from department to department and we are already jumping from item to item in education .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. ng .
his comments were right on track .
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas :
thank you mr. chairman .
the finance minister spoke earlier about 395 thousand being allocated a larger gym in the replacement for the killiniq high school in cambridge bay .
as i understand it this additional cost would require building a larger than standard size gymnasium .
how much of the expenditure is in the education capital estimates for 2000 / 2001 .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
minister arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
this is a detailed informational requirement so i will ask the deputy minister to answer that .
chairperson :
mr. moody .
mr. moody :

so the net expenditure when all is said and done would be just less than 294 thousand dollars .

i think this would be addressed to the minister of finance .
if anything is outside of the school capital then i am not really in a position to respond to that .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
there is also the issue of some funding for the heritage cultural centre that is a part of culture , language , elders &amp; youth budget estimates that will be tabled later .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
is that correct .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
are you asking the minister of finance .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
if that is true and we would put a hostel in there then it would even be more .
the heritage centre is a community program under capital and we welcome it as a very good idea that cambridge bay has initiated .
they want to participate in the community having this centre hooked up to the school .
but it is not from the education capital .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , if i could also ask that this capital project that is the total for the high school , right now it is 14.7 million dollars .
i just would like to ask if the other schools , replacement schools that we have in here , the draft capital amount they have money allocated to those are much more considerably less .
i was just wondering if the minister could explain why there is a difference .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
the total education capital budget for that school is 14.2 million .
let &apos;s get that very clear .
for anything else in comparison to other schools that the member is asking about , they are estimates also , but a lot less accurate than this one .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
is that all .
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
why is it that the department of education is taking a project on to themselves from a different department .
( interpretation ends ) it is the same government transferring from one department to another .
if the community could raise money that the government would match why is there department to department matching of costs .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you . minister arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
because we are not doubling the size that we would normally use to build a school for cambridge bay .
we are only increasing it from the standard criteria requirement to a full size , which is not doubling our original budget .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
are you done . mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , on the capital part there , there is a line for capital recoveries .
it is my understanding and you indicated earlier there is approximately 10 million dollars that is from the government insurance , i am just wondering why that &apos;s not shown in the recoveries .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
all the insurance recoveries go to the department of finance for them to administer and they receive it on behalf of the government .
it does not go to the department of education .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i just want to get some clarification there .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
certainly .
we have a budget for cambridge bay school under the normal standards and criteria and the budgets are being allocated for that school .
as for the enlarged gymnasium , there was a request by the community and the support of other communities too .
as for the heritage centre this is being funded through culture , language , elders &amp; youth that is again not part of the education budget .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i guess it is beyond normal standards and criteria .
if i could ask the minister how much of those two projects the ones that are included in the education budget and in the culture , language , elders &amp; youth budget .
are there any additional costs incurred by the building itself , the structure itself because of those projects .
in the space provided in the school for those purposes .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
i do not want the member to answer for me please , the answer was no .
we do not go beyond the standards and criteria if we were to build .
our budget reflects if we are to build the school the way we have it designed without the large gym .
the money is still the same .
with the large gym there is community support financially .
the heritage centre is a completely separate budget as well .
the heritage centre is like a house and if you decide to put an extra room or porch those are separate costs altogether .
it does not increase the cost to your original house and this is completely separately funded .
so that answer is no .
it does not create extra budget requirement of the department to have the enlarged gym and the heritage centre .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman i am a little confused .
i think he stated there are extra dollars , 395 thousand that was allocated for the larger gym .
is the minister saying that if that larger gym was not there the 395 thousand dollars would be still included .
i do not see how the size of gym would have been allocated there .
to me by enlarging it is adding an extra 395 thousand dollars .
i do not see how that could not change the money going to the project .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you ..
chairperson :
are you finished mr. tootoo .
i am sorry who did you say was going to respond .
mr. horn .
mr. horn :
thank you mr. chairman .
i am not quite sure what the real question is the member is asking .
we had the building designed , the design footprint has sufficient space for an enlarged gym .
the money needed to construct the enlarged gym was then allocated by cabinet , and the community through their own efforts are raising funds to assist with that .
so that is where it rests today .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
who was next .
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
so then , if i am correct , there were additional dollars allocated for the larger gym .
i am just wondering if that could be clarified .
i understood mr. horn to say that the footprint was there , the footprint allowed for a larger gym , and cabinet approved additional dollars for that gym .
that is what i heard .
i just wanted to make sure that is what i heard .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
which of you is to respond .
mr. minister .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
i got a letter from mr. wilcox stating that the community could pursue it .
so therefore we have in this case designed a large gym with capital dollars because we know in any community including cambridge bay they can not raise that amount of money overnight .
we appreciate that this is one community that is trying to do it for themselves instead of just asking the government to foot the bill for everything .
so we appreciate that and we welcome that .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman :
my question is in regards to the 390 thousand dollar funds for expanding or creating a larger gym .
it seems to be that we should have allocated this type of money to something of a more priority nature .
we could have used the 390 thousand dollars for something else .
you have to look at the teacher student ratio and how the classes are overcrowding .
so there could have been other uses rather than the enlargement of the gym .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
( interpretation ) we reviewed that and the amount of 390 thousand dollars is not a great addition to the school project .
for example , it will not really affect the monies that are going towards the school project .
cambridge bay is located in the central area between the keewatin and the kitikmeot. and you have many people going back and forth .
they do not have a facility of that size in cambridge bay .
considering they might want to host games in the future , there are no big facilities in that area .
we have begun work on the other priority communities like baker lake and clyde river but at the same time we know the kitikmeot is going to need a facility somewhere in the region .
we thought it should be in cambridge because of so much traffic going through there .
we will put the money in and if we want to do an expansion later without the aid of the community , it would be very costly .
they would have to tear some portions apart and rebuild it and to do it with the community support it would be less costly in the long run .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
okay if that is the case then the other communities who are willing to produce 25 % of the budget that is required are they given permission to do so if they wished .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
do you know the size of cambridge bay .
i was there this summer .
i went to visit the schools to see how many schools they have .
i met with the teaching staff and right now they are scattered all over the place trying to continue the education .
the number of students are going to equate to the size of the building .
the usage of the school will be in proportion to the population numbers .
looking at it in the long run we are actually making savings because part of the costs are being built in by the community .
had we not done it this way it would have cost the nunavut government more in the long term .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
there are three regions and in the baffin and three communities that are the same size as cambridge bay .
if that is the situation then would the three other communities also be able to do as cambridge bay .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
how many times do i have to say this , all of the schools will be reviewed in the 20 year long term plan .
these people need one and let &apos;s give them one right now .
we can make plans and preparations for their facility requirements but these will be included in the 20 year-plan .
the community has to be treated according to their needs .
that is how we have to look at it but we do not know if they want to do it like in cambridge bay where the community raised their own funds .
as long as the population warrants it then we will look at it according to the wishes of the people .
thank you .
speaker :
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
he says he is looking at this as a 20 year plan .
i heard this before i think it was last year .
i heard that they wanted a bigger gym in that school and it was in the news north and nunatsiaq news .
if you look at this in a 20 year term it seems to me they got their review and their plans in place within a year .
meanwhile the other communities have to wait for a 20 year time span .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
thank you mr. akesuk .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
there is no high school in cambridge bay .
it burnt down .
right now they are using hamlet offices for high school students .
i have a list of where they are holding their classes and they are trying to do their physical education in other places .
so this is an urgent item .
students and community members were interested in supporting us .
we were going to go and visit them .
we will be looking at our 20 year plan by visiting all the communities for those reasons .
for those reasons we agreed that the government , particularly the department of education is not in contravention of any of it &apos;s acts .
i also want to respond that if we build a new school wherever it may be in the communities we will also be looking at what the numbers will be in those classrooms .
the gym we can speak at length about this later as to what the community &apos;s requirements are .
the school in cape dorset has a capacity for elementary and high school .
so we are not saying we are going to require a new gym .
what we are trying to do is produce plans and the plan for cambridge bay is something we had prepared for and worked for under the goals of the department of education .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
we will continue at this time in corporate services .
kitikmeot region .
total kitikmeot region , 10 million , 803 thousand .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
first , i should ask a question .
are the schools insured , i will make another comment afterwards .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
all the schools are insured .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
why is it that when the particular school was insured why is it that they did not use the insurance money to build a new high school .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i do not know how many times i have answered that question .
we are using the insurance money .
like mr. tootoo said it is about 10 million dollars .
following the finance administration act they take the money or the revenue on behalf of the government .
i apologize .
this 8.2 million dollars does not go directly go to the department of education , it goes to the general revenues .
all revenues coming in by way of property tax , insurance or whatever any revenue goes to finance .
it does not go directly into the department .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i think i finally got it .
thank you very much .
another question is the 2000-2001 capital estimates .
there are prior year &apos;s costs and future year &apos;s costs .
what does that mean now .
looking at the heading , they are all zeros i do not know if it is for three years .
could you clarify the headings . in the 2000-2001 capital estimates , 7 million 9 hundred thousand would be used .
not 14 million .
three years will have used up that 14 million dollars in the three year span .
right .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
yes , the capital estimate that is being proposed by government of nunavut for the 2000-2001 .
what we did last year is we used 1.6 million for architectural purposes and for the foundation of the building .
for the construction we will be using 7 million 9 hundred thousand dollars .
we will be requesting 4 million and 7 hundred thousand in these three years during the construction of the high school .
total in those three years we will have used up 14 million 214 thousand .
this year because of course you can not construct a school and complete it in one year .
so we are going to be requesting dollars each year to complete the school in stages .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i agree now that it is clear .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
we are in the corporate services for the kitikmeot region . 10.8 million dollars .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na itsivautaq .
i am going to do a preamble and i will try to make my preamble short .
a few years back there was a lot of controversy in repulse bay regarding the extra cost in constructing the gym there .
the community was adamant that they wanted a larger gym .
that is what it came out to .
i was in that facility in december and it is excellent and it was well received in the community .
through no fault of cambridge bay &apos;s their school burnt down .
we are realising we have some of the insurance money back .
they were saying they had discussions with the gnwt before we split on the size of the gym in the jonah amitnaaq school .
for some reason the standards and criteria were changed from what the existing gym is on that school now .
if the renovation goes ahead or the replacement whatever happens , it is going to be smaller .
they were quite aghast about that .
my question is did the standards and criteria change for larger gyms in schools in the last four or five years .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i am not sure about this issue . i do not know whether the gnwt changed the criteria .
i will ask mr. horn to answer that question .
mr. horn :
thank you mr. chairman .
i can certainly inquire and bring that to the minister &apos;s attention and advise the member .
to the best of our knowledge they have not changed over the last four or five years .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
at this time we are at the kitikmeot region .
corporate services total capital estimates 10.8 million .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na itsivautaq .
i do not think my dea was misinformed .
they were told the preliminary sketches that the gym was going to be over 200 or 300 square meters smaller .
is that possible in the new standards and criteria . i know the baker lake school was built in 1957 before any other school in nunavut .
but as far as you know the standards and criteria have not changed in the last three of four years on high schools .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. horn .
mr. horn :
thank you mr. chairman .
it is an interesting question .
i think there is room for research on our part as to put the member &apos;s mind and the dea &apos;s mind at ease .
the plans or the work for baker lake in our current capital plan we have just approved a few moments ago is to address that very issue .
the size of the gym , the current standards .
so whatever the school population is and the projection of the next couple of years that will determine the size of the school based on the current school and the student population .
that very same process was applied against the school in cambridge bay .
the capital standards are a relatively recent thing in the department of education having been adopted in the 1988-1989 fiscal year .
so schools that were built before then were a little hit and miss in the sense of size of the gym but generally they stay within the 250 and / or 300 square meters .
so thus the reasons for establishing a series of criteria and standards in order that there be some consistencies among the schools .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
we are still in the kitikmeot region .
we have mr. barnabas .
mr. tootoo .
mr. nutarak .
who wants to make comments .
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
i will ask my question later .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i am just wondering in the design of the building the minister indicated 1.6 million dollars for the design .
i am just wondering mr. chairman , i have been to quite of few communities in nunavut and i have seen the schools in those communities .
mr. chairman , every school that i have seen is either a square or rectangle or is the most economical way for construction .
i am just wondering in light of the high architectural fees , is there something in the design of the school that the costs could be so high .
is it like a square box like other schools in nunavut .
or is its design different .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. horn .
mr. horn :
thank you mr. chairman .
that is a good question .
it is built in that and that covers the community consultation process , the conceptual drawings , the work to build up to get to the point .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i &apos;m glad that the gym is going to be a rectangle .
i &apos;m just wondering about the rest of the school .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. horn .
mr. horn :
thank you mr. chairman .
to the best of our knowledge the design and the planning of the conceptual work is done with standard architectural design and in consultation with the community .
we try our very , very best to work in consultation with the community .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
yes , it &apos;s good thing i got more than three supplementary questions .
is the design a square building or not .
i understood the design of the building is more contemporary with lots of curves and stuff like that .
that type of design and structure adds more costs and i just wanted to confirm whether the design of the school is square or are there lots of curves .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
mr. chairman we certainly would but i &apos;ll have to ask the public works to provide us with the design .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
i &apos;d appreciate it , i &apos;m sure that those types of drawings must be here at headquarters and maybe we can get them as soon as possible to have a look at .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
we certainly hope so but that will be up to culture , language , elders &amp; youth to determine that , but we certainly welcome it .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
will that be an automatic thing they get .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
no , mr. chairman that will not be .
what i was saying is that the funding programs for the schools will still be the responsibility of the department of education .
i &apos;m not saying that the department of education will systematically change the standards and criteria including the heritage centres as part of the capital planning .
i &apos;m not saying that .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
will that also be an option that &apos;s available as a standard thing for all schools from this project on as well .
thank you mr. chairman .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
we are committed to design with the inclusion of a community consultation before we build any schools from now on .
because what we think is good for the community is not necessarily it , that &apos;s why we are committed to visiting communities before we start making some school designs .
nakurmiik .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
what i could commit to the member is that we will talk to any community who would say yes a similar arrangement that those other communities that have done this .
as i said before , pangnirtung , repulse bay and now in the process of doing that with cambridge bay .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
we will take a break after mr. barnabas &apos; comments .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , i would like to take a 30 minute break so that the regular members can have a meeting in one of the caucus rooms .
i would like to make a motion to take a 30 minute break .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
all in favour of taking a 30 minute break .
we will take a 30 minute break at the tuktu room .
&gt; &gt; committee recessed at 5 : 06 pm and resumed at 6 : 14 pm .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i think we can begin our meeting again .
the committee will come to order .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
i would like to go back to what we agreed to concerning the baffin region capital estimates .
if you do not mind i had some questions under that department and i would like to refer to that section again .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
are we agreed that we go back to the baffin region section .
mr. nutarak go ahead .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
concerning pond inlet &apos;s new capital additions under capital projects the new high school addition , on page 9 -5 .
if the minister can inform us why is it not included under these details .
there is no budget allocated and the minister had said that he would consider that .
i wonder what plans he has for that then .
thank you mr. chairperson .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
murray horn will speak to that .
chairperson :
mr. horn .
mr. horn :
with regards to pond inlet there is money being carried over or there is a request for money to be carried over for next year .
in that money is the planning money for the project in pond inlet with respect to the elementary school and the demolition of some of the structure there .
as well , the design work is within the money that is already there for the new gymnasium .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
under capital projects it is included in these books .
chairperson :
mr. horn
mr. horn :
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you that is a clearer response .
they had mentioned they would do the planing according to the opening remarks the minister had made .
i knew it was not budgeted until next year but i got confused because he mentioned it in his opening remarks when he was opening the department of education &apos;s budget .
i thank him for the information and will be expecting to see this in the budget in the coming year .
i will expect this to become a reality in the future .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. arvaluk
hon. james arvaluk :
yes that is right .
there is a funding allocation but we could not begin the planning before april 1 .
but we do not know for sure about the demolition of the school .
the insulation might not be adequate and there might be some health related problems with that building .
in case we have to demolish it whether it is for asbestos , we have to do all that inspections first .
but we also know that this work can only be done in the warmer months .
so , that way we will know there are no dangers or hazards to the public .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
did he respond to your questions mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
yes he did and i thank him for his response .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
questions on the baffin region projects .
detail of capital , total headquarters region .

mr. tootoo .
committee motion 56 - 1 ( 3 ) :
deferral of kitikmeot capital allocations
mr. tootoo ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
and
whereas members wish to review the design of the new high school in cambridge bay ;
and
and
whereas the committee cannot make the decision on the kitikmeot region capital projects under the department of education at this time ;
mr. chairman , now therefore i move this committee defer further consideration of the capital estimates for the kitikmeot region under the department of education at this time . thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) : you are allowed .
comments to the motion . no comments to the motion .
all in favour of the motion . mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
when they can &apos;t come up with the twenty-five percent should we leave them alone . not consult with them anymore .
it seems to me , according to the wording , it will cause an obstacle to communities in the future when we want to consult with the communities . thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
mr. chairman , that is not the intent of the motion .
what we want to see are our responses from the departmental officials and so we want to defer it until we get the information and responses that we have asked for .
this will give them time .
we are not using this with the intent that it will not be passed .
the intent here is to get the information that we seek , and that is why we came up with the motion as it is .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
this information that we have been seeking has to be provided first .
we are lacking certain pieces of information that we require .
we are running out of time under the department of education .
we will have four days and during that time we are hoping to come back to the house with this item completed with once we get that information .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you mr. chairman .
i would like to ask the members proposing this motion in respect to the second clause with the intent to review the design of a new high school .
i find that very unusual mr. chairman and i would like to ask what is the purpose .
we agreed to provide that information but is there the technical expertise amongst the members .
is there the technical expertise amongst the staff that supports them right now to do a technical review on the design of a school .
this is just a question that i raise and what is the intent of including that in the motion .
i don &apos;t think that would be a problem in respect to communities that do not have that type of facility .
but , i would like to know and ask for some clarification from the movers of the motion on the proposing and supporting the motion .
is there going to be a cap on this .
what type of criteria are we using here .
is it unlimited in respect if they wanted a gym double the size would it be available under the current criteria .
would there be an acceptable cap of some sort or upper ceiling on that kind of financial commitment .
so maybe if we can get that clarified by the members .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. tootoo .
mr. tootoo :
thank you mr. chairman .
this is fairly straightforward to see if it is square or straight is not as expensive as curved and other different shapes .
that is the extent of that one .
as far as the twenty-five percent cap , i think based on the standards and criteria the government has in place and i don &apos;t expect it to go above what those standards are .
so i guess that would probably be the intention there .
again mr. chairperson , the motion is to defer it until we get some feedback on the questions that have been raised .

point of privilege
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i rise today on a point of privilege .
yesterday morning through the radio , i heard a report that was inaccurate by a member of the media .
mr. speaker , i wish to clarify the statements that i made during the interview .
the report that went through the radio is completely inaccurate .
i did not tell anyone that the department of sustainable development was in the process of investigating the workers &apos; compensation board &apos;s actions .
i was being asked by the reporter questions regarding the qikiqtarjuaq clam divers or former divers , on what the different options were for the divers .
however , mr. speaker , i could not speak about this until i had reviewed the situation , and i stated that i would do so .
i wish to also state that the minister of finance in our rankin inlet session , on february 23 , had also expressed concerns about media accuracy in the house .
having said that i want to clarify that my statements on this occasion were outside the house , but was aired publicly .
i am very concerned about this , mr. speaker , because events like these touch on our privileges as members , how our constituents perceive us and it can erode public confidence .
we as mlas and ministers rely on the media to report our statements accurately .
mr. speaker , i wanted to state this and clarify the erroneous report that was made about my interview .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. kilabuk .
your point of privilege has been noted .

nunavut sealing strategy update
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i have something a little bit better to say this time around with my minister &apos;s statement .
&gt; &gt; laughter
mr. speaker , last month i invited members of this house to iqaluit premiere of &quot; waiting at the edge &quot; , video .
since then this video has been shown to a select audience of young people in southern canada to gauge whether their attitudes about seal hunting could be positively influenced by this video .
i am pleased to advise this house that our test audience reported that the video dramatically changed how they viewed the nunavut seal hunt .
mr. speaker , later today i will be tabling the final version of &quot; waiting at the edge &quot; , video along with its companion educational booklet titled , &quot; seals and nunavut :
our tradition , our future &quot; , which we developed in partnership with the nunavut arts and crafts association .
&quot; waiting at the edge &quot; , will soon be broadcast in canada on the aboriginal people &apos;s network .
this manual has now been distributed to every community in nunavut through our wildlife offices .
thank you , mr. speaker .

appointment of members to the income support policy review
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i am pleased to update the legislative assembly on the status of the income support policy review .
i have appointed an additional member to the income support policy review .
ms. vivienne aknavigak of cambridge bay has been recommended by the nunavut social development council to participate on the review committee .
i met with the committee last week in iqaluit during their orientation session and i am confident that the group that has been assembled will have a productive review .
i am also pleased to advise the members that the group has selected frank ekpakohak , of kugluktuk , as its chair .
the members will begin travelling in late april to kugluktuk , kugaaruk , arviat baker lake , coral harbour , igloolik , arctic bay and iqaluit .

member &apos;s statement 292 - 1 ( 3 ) :
padlopingmiut and kivitummiut
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i feel that my member &apos;s statement time will be limited so i will probably ask for an extension .
this is regarding padlopingmiut and kivitummiut .
those people that were originally from these two places went to visit to their old camping grounds to do a healing program .
mr. speaker , since 1963 kivitummiut were being assimilated into communities at the time .
they were still using their old winter clothing and the only clothes that they brought with them were the clothes that they had on and a few utensils .
they were expecting to go back to their camp however they were not brought back to their old campground and the houses that they were living in were burnt to the ground .
just last summer mr. speaker , two of those campsites were dug out and they recovered an old hunting rifle and some cooking utensils that they had left behind .
there were many important artifacts that they found also .
i think it was known that these people had a very good life to live and they had all kinds of things that they needed .
however the people who sent them to communities had gone to their camp and burnt their houses down .
they were told that the social services department would look after their families .
during that same spring they did not go back to this particular camp until a few years later .
mr. speaker , i seek consent to continue my statement .
speaker :
the member is seeking unanimous consent to continue his statement .
are there any nays .
please proceed .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
eleven people who were originally from that place have passed since then .
last summer they decided to go back to their camp and they had a healing process going there .
mr. speaker , at the time diand was taking care of the inuit people in the arctic .
the people that were brought back into a community have been asking for some funds from the government of canada , to assist them in the healing process that they have to undergo .
we have also contacted nancy karetak-lindell to try to help them out in finding funds .
there are still some people living today that were originally in that camp that are in our community now and they would like to go back to their campgrounds this summer .
our governments , both federal and territorial , should be able to help them out .
i wish to thank allan angmarlik , who initiated this very important get together for my people .
they wanted to undergo a healing process so we should be able to support them .
thank you , mr. speaker .

mr. havioyak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker i rise today to talk about a very happy announcement in my home community .
i an extremely proud to recognize and congratulate a young nunavummiut on her selection to participate in an exciting international program .
june won four ulus including three golds in the inuit games category at the recent arctic winter games .
her selection to the olympic camp however was based on her previous involvement in sports , community activities and academic achievement .
i am sure she will represent nunavut and canada proudly at the sydney 2000 olympic youth camp later this year .
mr. speaker , i would also like to thank june &apos;s teacher mindy willets and sport nunavut president dawn currie for the assistance and support they have given june .
mr. speaker , i would like to ask my fellow colleagues to join me and show our appreciation and to recognize the accomplishment achieved by june .

gjoa haven water sample
mr. puqiqnak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i rise today on an issue that will come as no surprise to any of the members of this house .
the situation regarding the water supply in gjoa haven .
mr. speaker , although i was pleased to go home over the weekend , i got little rest .
the people of my community remain very concerned over the quality of their drinking water .
mr. speaker , i have brought with me today a sample of gjoa haven &apos;s water and it has bloodworms in it .
they were alive but they died on my way over here .
mr. speaker , as i said i have brought with me today a sample of gjoa haven &apos;s water that was supplied by residents of the community .
the water is from the same supply that over 1 thousand people use on a daily basis .
it has taken me two days and two nights to travel back to iqaluit to show the members of this house this water and to show that bloodworms continue to infest the water supply .
the gjoa haven water has finally reached the legislative assembly .
mr. speaker , i appreciate the efforts that the honourable jack anawak has been making to address this situation as a priority .
i urge him , mr. speaker , and his department to ensure that the public in gjoa haven is kept well informed about the work being done to fix this problem .
mr. speaker , when a situation like this occurs it is important that the public has confidence that every necessary step is taken to protect their well being and safety .
thank you , mr. speaker .

toonik tyme festival
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker and good afternoon .
uqaqti last week through the good efforts of many volunteers , our annual toonik tyme spring festival was held .
let me say mr. speaker , that many residents , including yours truly , thought that this year &apos;s toonik tyme was one of the best ever .
the technicolor dream coat play should also get special mention for the quality and the enthusiasm of the actors and all the participants .
the airfares for the aboriginal dancers came from the canada council , the other airfares came from canadian north , calm air and ntcl .
accommodations and meals for the dancers and garth people were at the ukkivik residence and donated by nunavut arctic college and paul irksaq and his family stayed with lesley and david serkoak .
mr. speaker , ish was brought in courtesy of canadian north and the elks .
the cerfs-volants vent en fete , the kite people mr. speaker , were brought in courtesy of canadian north and reynald icart .
you should know mr. speaker , that the kehewin native performers , ish , the fiddlers and the kite people went to every school in iqaluit to perform .
they also performed at the day cares and the racquetball club .
the fiddlers also performed for the rotary , the royal purple and the elders as well .
garth brooks also did a show at the residence and at the joamie school on friday afternoon .
mr. speaker , toonik tyme would not have been such a success without the financial and in kind assistance of so many different businesses and organizations and volunteers .
the organizers and volunteers deserve special recognition and i hope that i do not miss anyone when i try to give their names here today .
mr. speaker , they included david and lesley serkoak , patricia bell , stephanie yung-hing , joe tikivik , daniel malo ... mr. speaker i would seek unanimous consent to continue my statement .

awards to elizabeth haqpi and vannesa kalist
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na uqaqti .
i rise today to commend two residents of baker lake .
a tragedy was prevented by quick action of two jail guards in baker lake recently .
the guards elisabeth haqpi and vanessa kalist were presented with accommodation for their actions in early march .
elisabeth haqpi was awarded with a detachment commander &apos;s plaque while vanessa was presented by the commanding officer letter of appreciation .
baker lake rcmp corporal tim walton who presented the awards says the quick action of the guards prevented two inmates from doing harm to themselves .
the two guards know that something was wrong and their quick action prevented harm from happening .
haqpi has been a guard in baker lake for two years and enjoys her duties .
haqpi recently attended the rcmp training academy in regina saskatchewan to help update guard training in nunavut .
she was only one of two guards chosen from the north .
her quick actions prevented an almost near tragedy in qamanittuaq .

mr. nutarak .
member &apos;s statement 299 - 1 ( 3 ) :
education capital plan
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
my statement is a little long , so i ask the indulgence of the house .
as a result , members felt compelled to bring forward a number of motions in the house .
i would like to summarise the concerns of the members so that it is very clear what the concerns are .
priority means that these projects should be addressed first and that steps be taken to move these projects forward as much as possible in the coming fiscal year .
that seems to be a very basic request about meeting basic needs first .
i seek unanimous consent to conclude my member &apos;s statement .
speaker : the member is seeking unanimous consent to conclude his statement .
are there any nays .
proceed mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you speaker .
second , members are aware that the capital budget for projects is limited .
members want to see the 20-year plan that the department has committed to bringing forward so that the communities can all see when their priority needs will be met .
in addition to their larger wish lists because we know they can not all be done in one or two years .
this also seems to be a very basic request about good planning and clear expectations .
at the moment many communities are frustrated with the uncertainty surrounding their own needs .
members know that some communities will want these items now and we support their aspirations .
but unless there is a pressing education reason for such a project we want the department of education to encourage and help communities find other sources of funding for such projects outside our government .
this seems to be a very basic idea about priorities and support .
members know that there will be some projects that communities feel so strongly about that they are willing to help raise some of the money .
this will be an important consideration for the government and members agree that community support should be considered in establishing priorities .
this does not require that all communities must raise 25 percent of a larger gym .
if there is a pressing education reason then it may be that the department would pay for all of it such as where a gym may be needed for two schools .
if a smaller community can justify a larger gym for sport or conference reasons perhaps the government would accept a lower contribution from that community .
but the principal is that if a community will commit to raising the 25 percent over time then the government will consider this in planning priorities for allocating projects .
this seems to us a very basic request about fairness .
lastly , members know that certain architectural designs and extra inclusions will make a project very expensive .
the cambridge bay new high school is more expensive than other new schools in nunavut .
members have asked the minister and his officials about the design implications for the budget but have not received adequate answers and so members have asked to look at the design themselves .
we do not need experts to tell us if it is an expensive design .
we will be happy to hear from government of nunavut officials and ask them about the design implications on the budget for this project .
at a time when other priority school capital needs can not be met , members have given a list of other projects for consideration by the minister .
should he be in a position to re-profile any of the funds from one very expensive project to other projects we have recommended such alternatives .
members feel their concerns have been very clearly stated and members are looking forward to clear answers and clear leadership by the minister of education .
thank you mr. speaker .
&gt; &gt; applause
speaker :
thank you mr. nutarak .
just a few comments before we proceed .
just to remind members that the allocated time for members statements is two and a half minutes .
i think the understanding is when you ask for consent to continue you will probably be talking about 30 or 40 seconds .
i know that his topic is important to the member and his riding .
but it may be better delivered in committee of the whole .
thank you .

they had only two substitute players and had to work that much harder than the other teams .

oral questions
question 416 - 1 ( 3 ) :
responses to committees recommendations
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i wish to direct my question to the minister of education .
my fellow colleague &apos;s statement , i will rephrase a few of the statements he made today regarding social program recommendations .
when will he be reviewing the recommendations we presented to him .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister for education .
hon. james arvaluk : ... comment inaudible ... thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
would you please clarify mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is directed towards the minister of education .
i would like to know when he would deal with the recommendations from the social programs committee .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister responsible for education .
mr arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , i &apos;m not sure just what the member is asking .
is he talking about the nunavut social development council review or the income support review .
can i get the right title for that .
speaker :
can the member rephrase the question and identify the issue .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i do not recall giving the minister any other recommendations that came from other committees .
i do not know of any other recommendations given to the minister .
i think the minister is aware of what i am talking about , regarding the department of education recommendations .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister , i hope that you can provide an answer .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
mr. chairperson , the committee of the whole or the standing committee on the review of social programs .
what did the recommendations say .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you minister , let us try this again .
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas :
i &apos;m surprised too , mr. speaker .
during our committee of the whole , social programs came up with four recommendations .
when will he deal with those four recommendations dealing with the schools and gymnasiums for the communities of nunavut .
thank you .
speaker :
mr. arvaluk , i think the question is about the four recommendations that were put forth in the committee and the member is asking if there has been any movement on these recommendations .
thank you .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. speaker .
i am already in the committee of the whole .
i will be speaking to them during the committee of the whole during which the motions were put forward so that we can answer back in the committee of the whole .
we will be coming back to them today and we will be prepared to speak to them during the committee of the whole .
does the member wish me to answer that know .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
i think the issue may be best dealt with in the committee of the whole .
we will move on to the next member for oral questions .
oral questions .
mr. nutarak .
question 417 - 1 ( 3 ) :
income support review
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
he also indicated two other communities .
he stated that two communities had been stated to the original plan which were arviat and arctic bay .
during that time i asked the minister if pond inlet would be included in the community visits , and he indicated that igloolik would be one of the communities to be visited .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister responsible for education . mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
twenty-six communities would have to be visited .
due to our budget we cannot travel to every community in nunavut .
however , when i was meeting with the standing committee or special committee i indicated to them that we would be open to suggestions and recommendations .
that is why , as i indicated before , as mr. barnabas had made a statement that there are no people or councils in arctic bay and in the high arctic .
that is why we decided to include the arctic bay into our original plans .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
oral questions mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i am very happy the income support review committee will be visiting the communities and i just want to ask the minister if he can indicate from the council to visit pond inlet .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. iqaqrialu .
question 418 - 1 ( 3 ) :
social programs in the high arctic
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
this is to the minister of education .
i mentioned before there are not enough of social programs in the high arctic .
have you done a review of the communities to see which ones want more social development that others .
is that why you want to visit the communities .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister for education .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
which communities are able to be on their own .
if they have a mine close to the community .
we can use kugluktuk as an example , and it is very far from the capital .
it is also closer to yellowknife and it is also going to be closest to the mining activity , and we wanted to find out the impacts to that community .
in arviat we know that fast growth in population there and they don &apos;t have very much employment .
we don &apos;t really know whether there will be a highway project around the kivalliq region , through arviat as well as baker lake .
i will also say coral harbour is an island and it is very expensive to fly to .
as well they don &apos;t have high unemployment .
as well , igloolik is growing in population , they do not have as much employment , and we wanted to find out from the community about decentralization .
arctic bay as well , is close to a mine and we wanted to find out if there is employment gained from that mine and how many people are on income support .
in iqaluit there is a population explosion and they have many employment opportunities from the nunavut government .
how many people are receiving income support .
that is one of the reasons why we wanted to review those communities because of the difference and the impact they are receiving at this time .
also , we want to be able to receive some input from other communities by radio , through the media , and by letter .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you minister arvaluk for that lengthy dissertation .
i would ask the ministers and members to be precise and concise in their questions and answers .
supplementary .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker for the lengthy answer .
i do understand his response .
i also understood him to talk about people in kugluktuk closer to yellowknife and we pay lower prices here in the baffin region .
i feel that because of the shipments from the south which are very expensive and we feel that we are paying the highest prices in the baffin region .
airfares are very expensive from the southern parts of canada and that is one of my concerns .
i just want to get some assurance and maybe if i can ask him a question .
the communities that are not going to be visited will they have a chance for input into their review .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
we will let people know where they could put their input .
mr. speaker , the member said that it is very expensive to travel in the high arctic .
that is not what we are doing a review on .
we are trying to find out if they can access some funding in other ways .
whether it is by going to school or doing other things to make themselves self-reliant in their community .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
oral questions mr. mclean .
question 419 - 1 ( 3 ) :
corporate taxes
mr. mclean :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question today is for the minister responsible for finance .
on our budget session in the summary of revenues for nunavut , it shows we are collecting over 7.5 million dollars in tobacco taxes in nunavut .
another line item we are collecting 1 million 780 thousand dollars on corporate income taxes .
speaker :
mr. ng .
hon. kelvin ng :
thank you speaker .
this is a very good question .
i &apos;ll give the proper information , but on this rare occasion i will have to take this as notice .
speaker :
thank you mr. ng .
oral questions mr. irqittuq .
question 420 - 1 ( 3 ) :
suicide prevention funding
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
my question is directed to the minister of health and social services .
i made a statement on suicide earlier on in my member &apos;s statement and i just wondered how they provide funding for prevention of suicide .
for instance , how can those people do a workshop how are they giving funding to teach suicide prevention .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister responsible for health and social services , mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
we address money through community wellness , each community has an opportunity to access community wellness to fund post intervention and work on suicide prevention .
the communities also have the opportunity to apply directly to the department of health and social services , and we will provide a facilitator to co-ordinate some suicide programs .
so , there are several avenues to be brought forward by communities for suicide prevention .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
oral question , supplementary mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to ask the minister again is there funding readily available in the minister &apos;s department .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
yes , as i tried to indicate , coming up in this year &apos;s budget , fiscal year 2000 / 2001 .
the members are aware of that it will come forward in the budget .
approximately 2 million dollars is there for suicide strategy and prevention .
also each community which has happened in the past up to a few weeks ago mr. speaker , can access community wellness money .
there is also money available from the federal government who we partner with to develop and put in place suicide strategies .
the workshop that was held in kugluktuk was in conjunction with community wellness in the kitikmeot region , the rcmp and indeed the department of health and social services .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
supplementary , mr. irqittuq .
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i would like to ask the minister , say for instance , the workshop that was recently held in kugluktuk .
they should not wait week after a suicide has been committed .
perhaps , if we can intervene as soon as possible in each community .
is that going to be the case .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , the member is right the nunavut government can &apos;t come out with some magic formula to stop suicides .
however , what can be done is and what is being done and there are several good examples right now in nunavut .
where communities take on the concern themselves and mr. ng just talked about the health committee in cambridge bay being set up . we think this is the avenue to approach this .
it has to start at the family level and it has to start at the community level , for the cessation of suicide .
now mr. speaker after saying that , the nunavut government has encouraged every community to develop a community wellness plan .
under that community wellness plan every community has the opportunity .
so they will be able to develop a proactive response to suicide .
but it has to come from the communities and that is why those monies are there .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
mr. irqittuq
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
this is an urgent matter .
there has to be adequate funding made available .
could the minister ensure that there will be funding available and better response time .
speaker :
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you , mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , let me make it perfectly clear .
if communities want help with suicide , the department of health and social services is there .
mr. speaker under the brighter futures money that our department handles for the federal government that money is there and communities can apply for it .
we have asked communities to come up with community wellness projects to run a series of workshops .
mr. speaker for example march 6-8 in clyde river .
again , mr. speaker may 5 will be held in iqaluit for chr training for all of nunavut .
mr. speaker the department of health and social services has been moving forward on this issue .
it is a very serious issue mr. speaker .
again , the solution as the member has said has to start at the community level .
it has to start at the family level .
it has to start at the local level .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
oral questions .
mr. kattuk .
question 421 - 1 ( 3 ) :
sanikiluaq &apos;s role in income support policy review
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i will be directing my question to the minister of education regarding the review that was mentioned earlier , my community is the farthest from the rest the of nunavut area .
i would like to know from the minister if sanikiluaq is going to be part of the income support policy review .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. kattuk .
minister arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
like i said earlier , there are 26 communities in the nunavut and we can not visit them all because we do not have adequate funding to cover nunavut wide travel .
we can not go to all the communities .
what we have decided is to go to the communities that are diverse .
even the communities we do not visit will be communicated in any other way .
for example , i have their telephone and addresses .
like i said the only communities we are going to are the ones that have been identified .
we are not overly concerned about the communities looking at this policy review nunavut wide .
we asked these members to see what would be best if we visited which community .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you minister .
oral questions .
supplementary mr. kattuk .
mr. kattuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i would like to thank the minister for his response .
thank you .
speaker :
oral questions .
mr. barnabas .
question 422 - 1 ( 3 ) :
urgent projects prioritisation
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker just recently we approved the interim appropriation act and there were two community projects that had to be dealt with right away .
i will be directing my question to the minister of community government and transportation mr. anawak .
how do you rate them or how do you prioritise these urgent matters .
speaker :
thank you mr. barnabas .
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
we have to keep in mind that when there is an urgent matter whether it is a health issue or safety issue it is considered urgent .
but then again , there are some communities who we have to deal with right away .
in addition , if there is a financial issue we have to deal with right away .
we have to have a plan for the year . we have to have a financial plan made ahead of time so we can deal with these in an urgent manner .
that is the reason why we put a contingency plan so that we can deal with such issues .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. anawak .
oral questions .
supplementary mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
in the interim appropriation act there were two communities that had to be dealt with right away .
does that mean we have to approve a special warrant every time an urgent matter arises in the community .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
the reason why they went through interim appropriations is that the main estimates are not approved yet .
because of that we had to go through a special warrant for us to act on it .
i could have talked to the cabinet members but we had to do that because the main estimates were not approved .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. anawak .
supplementary mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
simple question .
why is it that the issue was not mentioned on the appropriation act .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
i am sorry could the member rephrase his question please .
thank you .
speaker :
mr. barnabas could you re-phrase your question .
mr. barnabas :
my question is directed to the minister of community government .
why was one of the projects in minister &apos;s riding not funded under interim appropriation act when it was an emergency .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak :
mr. speaker i have no idea what the member is talking about .
speaker :
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas :
thank you mr. speaker .
mr. speaker , mr. puqiqnak &apos;s riding had the same problem and the other members riding had the same problem .
they were funded in the interim appropriation act .
why was not mr. puqiqnak riding not included with that interim appropriation act .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. anawak do you need more clarity on that question .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker , i apologise , it had to be done right away because the system was frozen in kugluktuk .
the water pipes were frozen and it had to be dealt with right away .
because of the quality of the water and because of the breakage they were still able to supply water to the community of uqsuqtuq .
so it was less urgent than the one in kugluktuk .
if we did not deal with kugluktuk they would have not have water supply .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. anawak .
final supplementary .
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
thank you for the clarification and i would also like to thank mr. anawak .
so my next question is about resolute bay which has an on-going concern with frozen pipelines .
ever since i started representing the community we have always had this as a problem .
it is just as important or as urgent as the kugluktuk .
so does that mean there will be money made available to fix this problem .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
mr. speaker i think this is the first time i have heard about this problem .
so i will look into it .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. anawak .

the boarding home in iqaluit call tamartirvik .
who owns this boarding home .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :
thank you mr. speaker .
the owner of the tamartirvik mr. iqaqrialu , is me and the people of nunavut .
we own the tamartirvik building .
it was a surplus building from education and access as a health boarding home for the last couple of years under the auspices of the baffin regional health and social services board .
mr. speaker , the contract i believe is with the elders group which is a non-profit society in iqaluit who do the management and day to day operation of the facility .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. picco .
oral questions .
supplementary mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :

this is the first time that i do , well if is my building .
since i visit there quite often , they do not have enough tvs or recreational activities set for the patients .
they can not even watch our proceedings .
can we look into this further and see how we can have a better working relationship with the tamartirvik building .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. picco .
hon. ed picco :

community centre for cape dorset
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
my questions will be directed to the minister of community government and transportation .
as the population of cape dorset , some more so than the other communities .
in my community we have a very small community centre although the population has doubled .
is there going to be a review done on whether the community halls are adequate for the communities . speaker :
mr. anawak . hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
yes what he is saying is very true .
some communities have had tremendous population growth over the last few years and some of them are falling behind on financially .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
oral questions . supplementary .
mr. akesuk . mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
when will he be having this review done .
even during special events in the community , many residents do not go to the centres anymore .
so when will he have this review done .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
first i would like to apologise to the member .
like i have stated , we will be visiting pond inlet , kugaaruk , and gjoa haven .
they have centres that are quite small for the community . i am sure cape dorset has the same problem as well .
so i will be considering that community and we have always talked about forced growth in our government .
i will be making an effort to review all the communities but due to inadequate funding our review will probably be limited due to financial problems .
i will state to the member that his community will be one of the communities that will be reviewed .
we will be considering forced growth in his community .

thank you .
speaker :
ms. thompson .
hon. manitok thompson :
thank you mr. speaker .
i do not think there were very many communities visited in this one . i have to get back to the member with that information as soon as i get it .

thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :

so can the member please clarify which survey he is talking about .
thank you .
speaker :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
perhaps the minister can table all the reports of the polar bear surveys . so it will become clearer to those hunters out there who hunt polar bears .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
mr. kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
i have no problem tabling the reports .

question 427 - 1 ( 3 ) :
qikiqtarjuaq clam divers
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
my question will be directed to the minister of sustainable development .
this morning when we first started our meeting i was very happy when he was making a statement about the qikiqtarjuaq divers .
this has been a problem for qikiqtarjuaq clam divers and it is not only in qikiqtarjuaq .
clam diving is becoming popular , there is diving in iqaluit and arctic bay .
i would like to ask the minister what kind of problems they have been encountering since they have stopped some of the diving that are being done in those communities that i just mentioned .
i know there are many people out there who are willing to hear from the minister .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
before we continue i just want to remind the members again try to make your preambles lead to questions .
also for the ministers to keep their answers as precise as possible .
thank you . mr. minister .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
he indicated that he could hear my response when i was being questioned by cbc radio .
yes during my statement i indicated that the information brought forth was inaccurate .
i know we expect some of the mistakes that will be happening when it comes to cbc news reports .
we would like to see this being avoided in the future .
i just want to make clarification further .
if anybody wants to get a diving licence he would have to go through training .
safety training courses and there are about 16 who have completed training programs .
when it comes to diving , they have completed level 1 and there are also level 2 training programs .
of course they would have to complete level 1 diving before they can try to get a certificate to get in level 2 .
if they were going into commercial diving then the person who will have commercial diving certificate , he would have to complete a comprehensive training as they will be training for commercial diving .
that is my answer .
thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you minister .

thank you mr. speaker .
speaker :
minister kilabuk .
hon. peter kilabuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. speaker .
this was not done by our department .
at this point in time i do not know of any person that has a commercial licence for clam diving .
if those licences were issued it was not by our department .
if there was a person who has a commercial licence than i do not know anything about that .

mr. mclean .
question 428 - 1 ( 3 ) : lack of elders housing
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na uqaqti .
uqaqti my question today is to the minister of housing .
uqaqti i know the task force final report and recommendations will be coming soon as the minister has promised me and she has taken my other questions as notice .
but there is one concern uqaqti that we have not heard much about is the serious state of elders housing or lack of it in nunavut .
will the minister assure me that this will be taken into considerations .
the state of elders housing and what we are going to do about it in nunavut .

mr. irqittuq .
question 429 - 1 ( 3 ) :
retirement conditions
mr. irqittuq ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker . my question is directed to two ministers , the minister for community government and the health minister .
i am not sure which minister this should be directed to , perhaps to mr. anawak .
can these people be assisted better if they have to quite because of medical reasons when they are not quite ready to retire yet .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
thank you mr. irqittuq .
mr. anawak .
hon. jack anawak ( interpretation ) :
thank you , mr. speaker .
i am not really sure how it works but the question that you seem to be asking is if a person ... i am sorry but perhaps i am not understanding you properly .
some people , there are seasonal employees and full time employees , i am not sure which category he is talking about .
are you talking about people that are on seasonal employment or on full time employment .
can he rephrase his question .
thank you , mr. speaker .
speaker :
just before we get further clarification on the question i will just remind members that they should address the question to one minister .

it is up to the members .
these tabled documents are for the committee to consider during committee of the whole and you can ask questions on those documents .
what is the wish of the committee .
are you clear on that .
what is the wish of the committee .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
we were under the department of education and we have not moved from the department of education from last week , if the minister and his staff could go to the witness table .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
just to clarify to the members .
first i mentioned that the committee deferred parts of the budget for the department of education .
i just wanted to find out from the members what is the wish of the members from last week &apos;s discussion .
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
we all already agreed this morning that when we met as a regular caucus that we would deal with that .
the motion still stands to recommend the deferral of part of the budget of the department of education at this time .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. barnabas .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
we have not completed this item .
the motion that we made in regards to the deferral of the budget maybe we could just have the minister at the witness table with his staff and we could continue to question him .
we could continue from there .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
that is my understanding from this morning .
so because the committee deferred part of the department of education &apos;s budget , will we go to the operations and maintenance of the department of education .
that is my question to the committee right now .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
the capital budget for the department of education we were on the last page and that is the deferral that we were referring to .
we are still in this book here .
perhaps we could begin with the department of health &amp; social services under their capital budget .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
perhaps if we could deal with the department of education o &amp; m right now that is my preference .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i am hearing two things that you want to discuss .
some members want to deal with the department of education and some people just want to leave it for a bit and go to the department of health &amp; social services .
but from my understanding of mr. akesuk &apos;s comments , he would like to deal with the operations and maintenance budget for education .
is that correct .
okay we will do that .
i think we all have this book , 2000 / 2001 under 9 - 4 is where we are .
main estimates .
minister you can go to the witness table with your staff .
thank you mr. minister .
welcome .
i know the person on your right but i do not know the person on your left .
possibly you could introduce your staff at this time .
mr. minister .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman , on my right and on your left is robert moody , deputy minister of education and also on my left is connie brown .
she is our controller for the department of education .

mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i apologize , i have a question for the minister in regards to the 354 thousand .
is that including the school operations and maintenance for the library portions of the schools .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
we are on page 9 - 6 .
minister arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
no .
this 354 thousand library services is for six communities .

minister arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i would like to have connie brown respond to this question .
thank you .
chairperson :
ms. brown .
ms. brown :
thank you mr. chairman . it is actually eleven communities .
the baffin 225 , the kivalliq 86 thousand and the kitikmeot 43 thousand .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
minister did you want to supplement that answer .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
yes , like mr. iqaqrialu said , are there any plans for the other communities .
you have to make a proposal and a request to get some of this money .
sometimes they are able to access funds although they are very small through the hamlet councils .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
in the plans for the cambridge school there is a library that will be in that school .
is there a library in there .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
i apologize mr. chairman .
i would like to hear from ian .
the way it is the requests or proposals are submitted to our department , but i am not quite sure what kind of libraries or services they have available in the communities .
possibly mr. rose could address this issue , if you could wait a minute .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. minister are you going to get that note right away or did you need a few minutes .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
like i said the requests are made through the hamlet councils , but the library is in the school .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
my question was , if these monies are set aside for the cambridge bay school .
mr. chairman , i have visited the community of cambridge bay and they already have an existing library .
are they not funding that library , or have they set aside some money .
chairperson :
arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i will get mr. moody to answer your question .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. moody .
mr. moody :
thank you mr. chairman .
the monies described here in operations go to the eleven community libraries for operational expenses .
in this particular case , cambridge bay and the other ten that were mentioned , mr. chairman .
so they are for operational expenses .
that would be the same regardless of whether the community library was in a separate facility or co-sharing the facility with the school .
so it is money that is applied for and the department gives it out to help the community libraries operate .
this is operational money for day to day .
in this particular case in question it &apos;s for technology related services .
so one is for capital and one is for current .
nakurmiik .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. moody .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na itsivautaq .
community libraries in my opinion are very important to the communities .
in my community they combine the elementary school library with the community library because they were very , very small and very poorly financed for o &amp; m.
how is the o &amp; m distributed .
by the size of the community based on per capita , or whatever funding proposal is sent in .
how are they funded , per capita or by what they request .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. mclean .
i guess we will have to do a little bit of waiting now and then .
there is still four years to go to deal with all the operations dollars .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
i am told that this is an historical practice from the past and based on the past allocations and not on a per capita basis .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na itsivautaq .
yes , i know that we have only been around for a year so far , but is your department considering re-looking at a policy that treats everybody fairly and equitably in nunavut .
when i look at the distribution of dollars , it is no secret where the lion &apos;s share goes .
over 50 or 60 % of it goes to one region and probably rightly so .
so i hope the minister when he is revisiting this can rewrite the policy where everybody is treated fairly and equitably .
thank you , that &apos;s all i had .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. mclean .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you . mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na itsivautaq .
can i have consensus amongst the members to go back to the directorate for a question that just popped up with that answer .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
the member for baker lake is asking consent to go back to 9 - 4 .
do you agree .
you have consent .
go ahead .
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na itsivautaq and my colleagues for being very kind to let me do this , i appreciate it .
under the directorate part it has budget co-ordination and capital planning .
it &apos;s no secret that we are into a crisis in our schools in nunavut and if we can ever get out of it i think we will be miracle workers .
the finance minister is going to be under tremendous pressure to keep us all happy along with the education minister .
i know that they are both very committed to education and i know that for a fact .
but the point i am getting to here is in the capital planning .
that &apos;s a mouthful there for you .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
yes mr. chairman .
we have corporate services in our department now that is responsible for the accounting and the capital planning part of it .
this will be done on an annual basis within that twenty-year capital plan .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. chairman .
in the long run i think this would save us money and you would have that plan in place and you would be able to save money on design with a few modifications .
you would also be able to have contractors that are building these schools familiar as it is being built .
what i &apos;m saying is , can we get at a standard design concept and construction concept in schools in the future with a few modifications .
look at doing something like that to save money , because i look at the schools in iqaluit , the older schools .
they were probably funded by the federal government with their design and their concepts .
so is your department going in that direction during the capital planning and designing stage .
thank you .
chairperson :
arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
chesterfield is one of them and i think there are some other communities that have a generic design quality to them .
we are looking at that too .
however , you also have to consider terrain of individual communities .
will the design suit that type of soil and the community land base .
given the similarities of two communities , including the population of the students , then we would consider that as we already committed to the most cost effective way of building schools .
we will consider building more and larger if we can cut down on very costly architectural engineering as part of the school .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
we are on page 9-4 directory .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
thank you mr. chairman .
this will be my final question for the directory , on the policy budget co-ordination .
hearing you talk about the income support review , the high unemployment rate in communities across nunavut .
it is no secret that schools are going to cost in the ballpark of anywhere between 5 to 15 million dollars which means a substantial capital project in a community .
you were saying that you were trying to maximise this along with the income support policy review .
is this going to be debated or is your department going to try to integrate this on all the new capital projects over the next few years .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
minister .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
if you make the school requiring special tools and very complicated and highly technical designs then the capacity of the community will be reduced .
so we will keep that in mind when we are talking with public works .
making sure that the design is such that the community can participate in employment and training .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. kattuk , or mr. kattuk has left , next is mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
some of the questions that i wanted to ask were already asked .
when we were in rankin inlet , during our last session there i was asking many questions regarding the funds that have been distributed to the communities .
we want to treat the people of nunavut fairly .
having said that there are only eleven communities that will be receiving library services and getting contributions from the government .
i know that libraries are very useful to the communities but there are many other communities that will be overlooked when it comes to libraries .
this is somewhat unfair to the other communities .
however , i am asking the minister if you can avoid this kind of thing in the future .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu before the minister responds to the question .
the member for baker lake wanted to go back to 9-4 under directorate .
he made his comments under this page and when we first started i was asking if you wanted to go to the next page .
we are now under page 9-6 .
mr. iqaqrialu was referring to this item , under policy and planning .
minister are you going to respond to his question .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
yes , the communities are being considered for contribution funds and mr. iqaqrialu &apos;s comments are very true .
he will be open to suggestions from the public , but i cannot say how much money we will be funded for the branch in baker lake .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i &apos;m gong to be asking questions under page 9-6 .
i want to know the amount of money for 2000 / 2001 , the main estimates are 359 but in 1999 / 2000 the revised estimates say 391 .
i am wondering why there is a reduction here .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. barnabas .
ms. brown .
ms. brown :
thank you mr. chairman .
it was just a general reduction in computer and computer related equipment for libraries , because public works ... audio unavailable ...
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you ms. brown .
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
... audio unavailable ...
chairperson :
ms. brown .
ms. brown :
sorry mr. chairman , i didn &apos;t hear the question .
chairperson :
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas :
mr. chairman has this funding been allocated to communities for the 2000 / 2001 fiscal year .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i think the question is clear , ms. brown .
ms. brown :
thank you mr. chairman .
yes it has .
chairperson :
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas :
thank you mr. chairman .
this amount of funding , 13 thousand 6 hundred and 13 for communities will not pay for much library services , books or other materials .
what is expected that the community libraries can do with this amount of money .
chairperson :
thank you mr. barnabas .
mr. minister .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
as i stated earlier , library services were inherited from the gnwt .
we have funded these libraries not on a per capita basis as we have stated but from an arrangement that was practised by the gnwt .
the communities welcome the 13 thousand , especially where the community has no library , or a school has no library .
we would like to review that and probably seek input from the mlas and the communities to see what would be an appropriate arrangement for o &amp; m of these library services .
again , there is only so much the government can afford in terms of distribution of these funds for the library services .
so it is not a question of whether the 13 thousand dollars per community is an acceptable level of funding but can we make it more relevant .
however , having said that , the nunavut libraries manager in baker lake will be doing the co-ordination a lot cheaper and a lot more affordable in the community .
she will be able to rotate these books that some communities have and others don &apos;t have .
so when the community is finished with those books they could rotate them to another community .
that way you don &apos;t have to buy new books all the time .
there are many ways to carry on the community library service that we were not able to do before we hired that person .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas :
thank you mr. chairman .
i was once a student and the minister was also a student .
i think that he is probably aware that , i will use the dictionary for an example , there are certain kinds of books in schools that tend to wear out .
how are we going to be giving out worn out books to other communities for their use .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
this has not always been the case .
his question was more of a comment .
but if there is another community that requires a certain amount of books then the closest community to that school will have the opportunity to give the books to that particular school in need .
there are many books and i know they will be worn out but i think it will be helpful for the communities if they have books to choose from .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i wasn &apos;t quite clear on some of his responses .
is this amount of money available for the community or for the community school only .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
perhaps if we get to the page that he is on , that he is referring to .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i think we are still on the same page .
we are still under library services .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i was referring to the page we have just dealt with under grants and contributions .
it states 354 , main estimates .
i am sorry mr. chairperson , i indicated we were under page 9 - 5 , under other expenses .
within that 273 thousand , main estimates .
thank you .
chairperson : ( interpretation ) :
perhaps , mr. barnabas we have technicians upstairs that turn on our mikes and we also have a little red microphone .
perhaps if you can start using those appropriately .
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas :
minister , does the funding only apply to community libraries or does it also include school libraries .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
this is only for the community libraries , not the school libraries .
if they don &apos;t have a library they can get a co-ordinator , volunteer , and order books by mail through the co-ordination of nunavut library services .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. minister .
the next person to speak is mr. iqaqrialu .

where did that come from .
why is it in there .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :

mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
one million 349 thousand is what we already agreed to mr. chairman .
when we went to 16 thousand 674 i just wanted to ask the minister , 15 million 325 thousand , why is it there .
under the main estimates .

general question .
i have been involved with the education committee , especially in regards to the high school programs .
i would like to ask the minister of education why one community has double the money for the usage of the high school .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
we are under general questions on operations and maintenance right now .
okay , mr. iqaqrialu are you on 9 - 7 as well .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
because of the committee of the whole deferral of the items on the budget , the capital budget , 1 million 349 thousand total o &amp; m we have to agree to that .

hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
it is going to be in a couple of pages because we are going line by line at the moment .

chairperson ( interpretation ) :

mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i would like to go to 9 - 9 .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
okay we are on page 9 - 9 , department of education summary , adult education and post secondary services .
are there any general comments from the floor on that page 9 - 9 .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i am sorry but i made a mistake .
mr. iqaqrialu and i are on 9 - 9 , adult education and post secondary services , operations and maintenance .
we did not deal with that .
i am sorry we cannot go to 9 - 9 yet we have to deal with 9 - 8 first .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i am so confused because there are three different people that want to talk on this .
mr. iqaqrialu wants to go to 9 - 9 .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
as long as the amount is not over 20 million we have to go to 9 - 9 , i wanted to get to 9 - 9 right away because ...

grants to nunavut arctic college .
( interpretation ends ) thirteen million 268 thousand .
what specific programs does nunavut arctic college plan as core programs in the 2000 / 2001 year .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. barnabas .
mr. moody .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
mr. chairman , we cannot name all the specific programs that the member is requesting from the nunavut arctic college , for which our contribution totalled to 13 million 268 thousand .
this is a contribution from the government and we would ask mr. wilman if he could do core programs then he probably could respond .
but this is a contribution that we give to nunavut arctic college and from there they do the details of the spending programs .
if you would allow me to have mr. david wilman to answer that .
chairperson :
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
we do not need a specific answer but if you could give us written details , it would help .
my next question is in regards to which communities they will be giving contributions .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
mr. chairman , this is the same arrangement .
sorry . ( interpretation ) we would have to give you the full detail and possibly what we can do is give you written material on these contributions .
there &apos;s the ntep programs for example in different communities and there is also in igloolik there was a graduation and there is also i believe the nursing program .
i could give you a written submission , and possibly mr. wilman could give you a brief outline if you wanted oral details .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you . mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
if it is okay , we would like to get the written details .
what about the early childhood certificate program .
are they going to be getting a contribution also .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
mr. chairman , the early childhood program does not go through the college contributions .
it is on page 9 - 10 .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
we are on page 9 - 9 .
thank you .
mr. nutarak .
mr. nutarak ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i apologize , my question has been asked already .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
in the details , i have been given all the relevant information .
why is it that the adult education numbers are not here .
could you clarify that for me please .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
from what i understand if it is in reference to the adult education and arctic college , it is the abe program that is not funded by the government .
arctic college pays for the instructor but they have to put a proposal in .
for example , there is funding from the kivalliq partners , or in the baffin the kakivak association that funds some of these programs that go through arctic college .
for example , some of the programs are funded , but the majority of the programs are funded by organizations outside of the nunavut government .
for example , if they are social service recipients , they get an allowance from that department or the kivalliq partners fund them .
i don &apos;t know too much about the baffin area but they are funded by third parties .
what we are talking about here is the adult education that goes through arctic college and also for the universities .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
we will probably get into it on another page and it is possibly the same question that i asked earlier .
so does that mean that the communities can only receive funding if they make a proposal and are they funded only when the students go to school .
chairperson :
minister arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
also , there was a reduction in the numbers here because the nunavut unified human resource strategy set up a program to train students on senior assignments , and the federal government funded them .
this program is now over and it did give us a new injection of money into that program .
with that in mind we put in 1 million 804 thousand dollars into the teacher education strategy .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na itsivautaq .
on the college contributions the government supplies or supports the core funding of 13 million 258 thousand .
how much does the college go out and raise itself through third party funding .
i don &apos;t have the annual report of the arctic college available in front of me .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
the arctic college raises 6 to 8 million dollars a year that we get from outside the government .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i am sorry , from what i hear there is six to eight million dollars that we receive from outside . mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na itsivautaq .
like i say i guess i will read the annual report . on the teacher education strategy , 1 million 804 thousand .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. mclean .
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
we already have two enrolled , in fact i think they completed their first year last year of the mba program .
because when you become a high school teacher you have to specialise in math or english , or social studies , science etc .
that is already the case .
but for those high school teachers-to-be we will bring in the instructors from mcgill university to do their high school certification .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
mr. akesuk .
mr. akesuk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i would like to know why that is .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. akesuk .
mr. moody .
mr. moody :
thank you mr. chairman .
the labour market development lead negotiator is not a study it was payments to a negotiator to work with the government of canada on our behalf to negotiate a new agreement .
we are waiting the final determination from canada .
so there is no report per se but the agreement we believe the minister will be able to make an announcement on that very soon .
so it will be done soon in the new fiscal year .
the labour market needs analysis study is almost done , we don &apos;t have a final report yet , so again most of that was paid for last year .
when that final report , which we hope will be soon , once again a copy will be made available and it will be a public document .

thank you deputy minister .
page 9 - 9 . branch summary .
i do not believe there are any further general comments . mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman . the 13 million , i believe we understand where the 13 million dollars is coming from .
maybe we can proceed .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
if there are no more general questions or comments . we can then go on to 9 - 8 .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i thought we were going to be moving to another line but i do have another question regarding the disabled persons .
the 300 thousand dollars set aside for disabled persons . my question is in regards to the disabled .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. iqaqrialu are you on 9 - 9 .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
the reason why i asked this , as you know there is nothing set aside for the year 2000 / 2001 .
we have to have money for the disabled persons also , why is it that there is no money set aside for this year .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. minister .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
perhaps mr. iqaqrialu did not hear when connie responded earlier to mr. akesuk &apos;s question about what this 300 thousand was for .
this is not for operations and maintenance of disabled persons , it was just money set aside to have some studies done on them .
but i want to make it clear that people with disabilities will be looked after under the culture , language , elders &amp; youth department through contributions to the communities .
like we indicated earlier this was just an amount that was expended to make studies and we have completed the studies so we do not need any more money .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
thank you for the clarification .
looking at some of the responses that have been made to my previous questions under adult education and post secondary , there are many differences between contributions to communities .
i know that we are not on that particular page so perhaps when we get to the appropriate page under income support maybe i will raise my question then .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
that was more of a comment , not a question .
we are still under 9 - 9 .
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
if we are not going to extend our sitting hours , i think it is pretty close to having to report progress .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
i think it was this morning or last week , we all received a meeting schedule from the clerk &apos;s office and from the speaker .
starting today i think it stated that we could go beyond six o &apos;clock if we have to deal with our items today .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
i want to continue with our discussions so perhaps we could take a five-minute break , then we can continue .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
does the committee agree .
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
the standing committee on culture , education and health has to have a meeting tonight so therefore i would put a motion on the floor to report progress .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
there is a motion on the floor and the motion is not debatable .
so i will ask the speaker to come back into the house .
my apologies , there is a motion on the floor .
to the motion .
all those in favour .
those opposed .
just hang on a second please .
there is a motion on the floor to report progress , if you could raise your hands if you are in favour of the motion .
okay if there are no more questions under page 9 - 9 we will go back to 9 - 8 under department of education .
branch summary , adult education and post-secondary services , operations and maintenance .
total operations and maintenance , 20 million 189 thousand .
mr. barnabas .
mr. barnabas ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
some of these funds are under capital items so i am wondering if we could defer this amount of money as well .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
just to clarify to the member , this amount of 20 million 189 thousand is not in the capital budget so therefore we cannot defer it .
mr. iqaqrialu .
okay that &apos;s it for me . i quit .
&gt; &gt; laughter
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
okay total operations and maintenance , 20 million 189 thousand .
total expenditures 20 million 189 thousand .
on to page 9 - 11 and 9 - 12 . information items .
under department of education branch summary , early childhood education and school services .
any comments .
questions .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
this 1 million 398 thousand under 2001 main estimates under contributions to aboriginal language and cultural programs .
this is for a cultural program initiative for kindergarten to grade 12 .
i just want clarification on this , i really like the idea though , of what is in there .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. minister .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
this is a contribution to nunavut wide aboriginal language and cultural programs in all of nunavut .
we contribute some money to district education councils .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
yes , just for further clarification .
if we can look at iqaluit , the amount of money that is provided to iqaluit i do not think apex is included in here .
maybe it is but it sounds like apex is not under that same responsibility .
are there going to be some grants and contributions given to apex schools .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
i don &apos;t think i made it clear enough .
each individual school is not usually provided with funds .
iqaluit would be the main for baffin , bake lake for kivalliq , and cambridge bay for kitikmeot .
those are the three regions we provide money to .
chairperson :
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
okay i already know this but under expenditures there has been some indication that the amount of money that apex schools has is not listed here .
so i am just wondering if apex schools are included in the amount of money that is provided for the iqaluit district .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
yes that is the case .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
under page 9 - 11 .
are there any more comments or questions from the members .
okay 9 - 11 and 9 - 12 department of education . mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman . there is 1 million 335 thousand .
is that for all of nunavut . that &apos;s early childhood programs .
thank you .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. minister .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
yes mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .
page 9 - 11 and 9 - 12 . early childhood education and school services .
mr. iqaqrialu .
mr. iqaqrialu ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman . in 1999 / 2000 there was 50 million but now there is 52 million 224 under territorial schools .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. chairman .
the reason why there is an increase is because the students &apos; ages are going up and they have to enter the school so there is an increase of 1.2 million .
as well there is an additional 357 thousand because of the increase in school children entering the school programs .
thank you mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you mr. arvaluk .
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na itsivautaq .
under territorial schools the funding of 52 million 224 thousand .
i guess under this figure there is a student teacher ratio .
is that correct .
is that how this funding is pegged . is it part of it .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
mr. chairman , it is more of a general formula but as i stated before it is about 20 pages long so i would like to have bob moody respond to that .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na itsivautaq .
i didn &apos;t really want 20 pages james , because i won &apos;t read it i &apos;ll tell you ahead of time .
but on this figure of 52 million , am i correct in assuming that our school population will go up by 10 % this year .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
thank you mr. chairman .
i am being told that the best estimate so far is 3 to 4 % .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. mclean .
mr. mclean :
ma &apos;na itsivautaq .
so this 52 million 224 thousand and the 50 million 651 thousand , is that what this increase is taking into consideration when you increase it that much , the increase in student enrolment .
is that part of the reason this increase has happened .
thank you .
chairperson :
mr. arvaluk .
hon. james arvaluk :
yes , mr. chairman .
chairperson ( interpretation ) :
thank you .

from the previous year and from the revised estimates . if we do not expend the amount we put it into the main estimates .
thank you mr. chairman .

i just want you to know that .
mr. barnabas .
